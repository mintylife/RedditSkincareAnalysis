I’ve bought quite a few ordinary products, including retinoid which says to use in PM. 

So I was thinking in the AM to cleanse, tone, serum (the ordinary’s buffet) and moisturise. 

Then in the PM to cleanse, tone, serum (hydraulic acid), retinoid (ordinary’s granactive retinoid) and then night cream. 

But because I won’t be leaving the house this month, it feels a bit unnecessary and wasteful of products (?) but I’m not an expert haha so if it is worth doing I’ll stick to both AM and PM. Or if you have any suggestions let me know :)

[SHELFIE] I need help to determine my skin issues and type.,0,jlxywc,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jlxywc/shelfie_i_need_help_to_determine_my_skin_issues/,2,"Before I get into the specifics of my current exact concerns I'm just going to break down my current skin information, and then how I got here. Then my current issue. Also I do recognize that my acne is no where near as bad as some peoples and I am grateful but I still want to see if I can fix mine. Thanks for reading.  


**My Body Information:** 19 years of age, Male, 5'5, 138 lbs, Between 15 - 25% body fat.

**Skin Information:** Slightly Oily (I believe \[*possibly combination\]*), Been having very mild acne for like 5 and a half  years, got much worse in comparison about a year and a half ago. Some pimples last very long time.

**Skin Goals:** Discover true skin type, discover what type of pimples I'm getting and what steps I can take to clear my skin as best I can and then prevent acne in the future.

**CURRENT Skin Care Routine:** ***Morning -*** Shower in the morning whenever I wake up and rinse face with water then gently scrub face using ""*For blemish-prone skin* Facial Cleansing Gel"" made by atoma. Leave it on for 30 seconds then rinse it off while still in the shower. After drying apply thin layer of ""Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%"" made by The Ordinary. ***Night -*** Rinse my face with wet, warm washcloth. Pat dry face. Apply previously mentioned ""Facial Cleansing Gel"" for 2 minutes-ish. Wipe off with wet washcloth. Pat face dry again. Apply thicker layer of previously mentioned Niacinamide solution. Go to bed.

I believe my skincare routine is at least preventing my face from badly breaking out. I believe this because, as evidence my example is, I went on a 3 day trip and didn't use them for those days and got a cyst on my face for about a month. Then in general if I miss a day I usually get a bad pimple.

Here are some images of my current skin: [https://imgur.com/a/nXFd1uk](https://imgur.com/a/nXFd1uk)

**Current Concerns and Goals:** If you refer to image 1 of the 3 you can see little bumps with dark spots in the center. What are these? They have been on my skin for many months and they are the worst there but they are all over my face. Now on image 3 of the 3 my cheek is slightly more patchy red than anywhere on my face, That's been like that for a while too and I don't understand why. I also don't for sure know what type of skin I have. I've been getting single off really really bad pimples since grade 6 but about a year and a half ago my skin broke out a lot worse. What can I do to fix this acne?

**IMPORTANT Skin History:** So I'll go over my entire skincare history, problems and routines and all. So from about 13 years old up until 17 years old all I had no skincare routine and used no products. During this period generally my skin was completely clear and soft. Though every once and a while I would get a pimple and when I would it would be a really really bad one. Huge and disgusting and lasting a week. 

One day I was 17 and got one of my nasty ones and wanted to fix it (because I was gonna see the girl I liked). So I got some kind of spot treatment product using an acid and it worked on that spot so I used it in a few spots but my skin got VERY dry so I went and got a moisturizer. I got ""Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion"" and used it on my full face. and for a few weeks I used that every day and felt great about it. 

But then over time I realized my face was getting tiny skin-colored pimple looking things all over my face. Figured it was acne but I had hoped it would just go away (Not the smartest choice) and ignored it. Then it got much worse so I thought maybe I was allergic to the moisturizer. Made a post on this subreddit to figure it out. That post is here - [https://tinyurl.com/y2htc68u](https://tinyurl.com/y2htc68u) 

So after that post, based on the response, I got a much thinner moisturizer to switch to. Therefore I started using ""Moisturizing Lotion - Face and Body - All Skin Types"" by Cetaphil everyday (I actually think I switched to something else first but that doesn't matter too much). But sadly this changed nothing on my skin so I added the Facial Cleansing Gel I currently use but again not much changed. Then I stopped using anything and my face got worse. So then I added The Ordinary product to my routine and made my current skincare routine. The Ordinary product definitely helped at least make the red spots less red.

aaand that leaves us where we currently are now. I don't know what to do for my skin now and need some help. I've tried a lot of other outside things like eating more fish, switching to new pillow cases, washing hands more and less touching face, eating healthier in general. Nothing seems to help long term. What can I do?",1604241208.0
