If you correctly guessed what all of those products were just by looking at the painting you spend too much time on this sub and we are besties  That‚Äôs seriously super cool. I need that hanging in my bathroom.
 I had to do an autobiographical still life for my painting class, and thought of my skincare routine, naturally.

Products:

* Vanicream moisturizer
* Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46
* Timeless Vitamin C
* Curology

Skincare goals:

Protect and defend/have good skin at 50 years old That's the best shelfie I've seen on this sub. Is that Vanicream? Love that stuff. Such a good painting! [deleted] Oh I LOVE this. You should sell these!  Ohhhhh. I love this.  This is the first shelfie I actually want to compliment. Really well done! I'm been on this sub so long that I recognized all of the products XD Love the timeless! It‚Äôs the best.  Beautiful use of light and shadow! adore this I absolutely love this. Thank you for sharing!! LOOOVE it! good good one! <3 Yay! Some of my favorite things: watercolor and skincare! Come on over to /r/watercolorchallenge ! [deleted] omg can i pay you to paint one of MY shelf!?!  You could make some good money doing this! Have people give you three products you paint, we pay!  I LOVE this and I am totally going to copy you. What a fun piece! I have used Vanicream moisturizer for over 10 years. When I was scrolling through Reddit- I had to do a double take. Thought someone had gotten a pic of my bathroom sink somehow! Great job !  I use all the vanicream products too!

Had a crazy allergic reaction on my face last year and I found vanicream.

It saved my life and my face lol I went to a dermatologist to help with my face and when I told him I was using vanicream he was hella impressed.

I will use it the rest of my life üíï I love this! Wow this picture is so pretty! Your art style is so beautiful  Someone should pay you for this excellent art. I hate watercolor because it‚Äôs such a difficult medium to make good looking but you really brought out the vibrancy in these items and I just love the slice of life vibe this gives me! I would hang it in the bathroom above my toilet haha. Can we guess the products? I'm gonna without looking at the comments :) I see CeraVe in the tub, maybe the blue dropper from Timeless? A CosRX bottle with a pump, & something from Paula's Choice? Aw I love this! I love this more than can be reasonably explained Oh wow, that's so neat! I enjoy watercolor art.  I love this! As an art student and skincare enthusiast haha Please do more  I want that  Has science gone too far? Nice study :)  I would buy this, you should sell these as bathroom prints   Need this on my bathroom wall üòÇ I am a vanicream addict! I really need to start doing watercolors again... Is that some timeless and EltaMD I see?  Nice! I recognized all but the Vitamin C right away. Have you compared it to TruSkin‚Äôs serum? Girl you should do these on commission, I would totally pay to have a watercolor of my shelfie in my bathroom! This is beautiful.

Edit: Just realized there were a lot of comments saying the same thing that I didn‚Äôt see because I didn‚Äôt scroll all the way üò¨ Guess that just means I‚Äôm not the only one thinking it! I love this! My new phone background  This is so freaking good!!! I love it! What paints did you use??
 Sis you‚Äôre really talented  I love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wanna do this too  Love this  I would pay good money for this! Of all the things to paint, you paint a picture of skincare products??? Looks really beautiful. where is the light coming from tho? Lemme see that apricot scrub Why do we have the same products üôÉ I was hoping this would happen  I identified every product in the painting and know how much they cost ‚Äî which is strange because I‚Äôve never bought any of them. I just spend that much time researching skincare.  Thank you! It was so fun to do  We need a vanicream club üòÇüòÇ perfect painting! Hi! Even though it's not a Shelfie in the traditional sense, can you add some reviews for the products? I'm especially interested in the Vanicream moisturizer :)

Also this is really really cool!! Thanks for sharing it here, mixing up the ol' SCA posts.  Very cool. I love this painting. It‚Äôs so on point with today‚Äôs modern life. 

I‚Äôm sure others have asked, but any chance you want to sell? I guessed all those right, despite the fact that I've never used any of those products, lol Thank you! Yes Vanicream! I love it too. Not pictured - Vanicream facial cleanser  I love watercolor too, it is hard as shit to not mess up  It was very fun, I totally would do them for other people Thanks!!! Ha it took me years lurking on here to get to this routine  Me too! I used to use Skinceuticals CE Ferulic and then realized this was nearly the same, and like a zillion dollars less Thanks! I took a reference photo lying on the floor during the late afternoon  Thank you!  Thanks! I knew this would be the place to post it Thanks! OMG yes Oooh I've never seen that, is it good? Sure! PM me! PM me!!!! Would love to  Wait no, replace PC with La Roche Posay.  Seriously, that‚Äôd make an AMAZING addition to any bathroom  There is something so charming and serene about this painting. I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on hey it makes me feel good! Would love to purchase one if you ever decide to do another üòÖ Yes! Count me in. I use the soap and Free & Clear shampoo/conditioner too  preach! I am a recent Vanicream convert. it's a game changer. No one ever mentions Vanicream but it was literally a lifesaver for me. Especially because I live in a dry climate. Vanicream changed my life. Screw Cerave! üôä Reading her product lists reminded me that my vanicream was supposed to be delivered today. Went outside and it was sitting on my porch!

I tried it for the first time just now and love it! Ooh can I be in the club!?? üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yes! Happy to. I should preface this by saying my skin is sensitive, with a tendency for stress-reddening. 

Vanicream - Thick and heavy but gentle. 

Timeless Vitamin C - Vit C has made the biggest difference for me of any skin products. The best I've ever used is Skinceuticals, but the Timeless is a close second. Prefer it to Drunk Elephant which was irritating. 

Elta MD - My HG sunscreen. Would give everything else up to keep this product. 

Curology - I am using it because I have it (and use it up slowwwwly) but I don't know if I love it. My formula is a retinol, clindamycin and azelaic acid. Thinking about replacing it with Differin.  The best cleanser ever. May I please ask how you did the white?  Is it Gouache?  Your work is beautiful.  I respectfully disagree with the ‚Äúnot mess up.‚Äù  I seem to excel at that!!  Thanks for your info! Please start selling them!  Seconding you selling them. I'd love one. I have been using this every day for almost 2 years and can tell a huge difference in my skin. I turned 50 this year and I‚Äôve gotten so many comments on how much younger my skin looks and what my secret is.  :) let us all know if you ever sell any or take requests! do you have an intstagram? would love to see more of your stuff  I love how you added the reflection too! oml OML Oh wellüòÇ I checked. I tried. This is really cute!! It‚Äôd be a little bit on-the-nose though, don‚Äôt you think? Like, would you hang a painting of a couch in your living room above your couch? 

Like, I get it if you‚Äôre just trying to be meta. But otherwise.  Vanicream has a shampoo?????!!! The only brand I use more than one product from is Vanicream/Free & Clear. The shampoo is criminally underrated! Ooohhh tell me about it!!! I sound like a Vanicream marketing person in this subreddit, I swear. I try to tone it down so people don't get suspicious or annoyed, haha

Cheap, huge package, extremely gentle, vegan, cruelty free... Literally all my dreams came true with this brand. It's amazing for sensitive differin users.  Yes yes yes the only thing to save my face and hands!!! It's so simple and gentle, I'm obsessed  Amen! YESSSS Yes!!!!  Heck yeah you can!!!!! Vanicream club members, unite!!! The Elta has been a game changer for me! Love it Quick question: there seems to be several Timeless Vit C products when I search it. Which one specifically do you use/think is worth the money? Thanks Just the white of the paper/not painting in those spots  maybe the world needs an Etsy store of skincare product paintings... yes! PM me if you have a request! But you don't necessarily have products out in view, or as the focal point of the room. Typically I feel like you put them away? Plus the painting is stylized and the colours are nice :)

Lots of people have paintings of instruments in their music/ living rooms, it's just a theme Yes, and a body wash! Same! I am always talking about vanicream and no one ever upvotes me or says anything üò≠ I think I found where I belong here üòç I was gonna try the vanicream light. Oil skin here. I wonder maybe I‚Äôll pick it up. Just a quick all over face neck hands chest.  yes!!! I‚Äôm so happy to have found it. Vanicream cleanser, lotion.... please vanicream, make all the things. We bow to your greatness. Woah.  Dang. Massive skill.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Lol the ol‚Äô ‚Äúlotion theme‚Äù. Truly a perennial classic. 

Also:

>‚ÄùBut you don‚Äôt necessarily have products out in view,‚Äù

 
You think too highly of me Vanicream light is amazing!!!! That's why I said necessarily. Even super tidy people sometimes have those open-faced shelving units where you can see all the items. It's just a pretty picture, with nice colors to hang up... I don't think it's weird that it's of stuff that you might have in the bathroom because it doesn't look messy or boring, and people do that all the time. Try to tell me you don't think anyone has a painting of a living room setting in the living room. Someone playing on a piano, or a family gathered together or something. It's not unusual Lol I think you‚Äôre taking this a little too seriously and should maybe get in touch with your imagination a little **Hi everyone!

Every once in awhile I break down and buy a pack and smoke a couple before coming to my sense and tossing the death sticks. Every time I smoke now, I get a smattering of little zits all over my face. Anytime I have a craving I think of all the little oozing zits that will pop up the next day and I get over the craving real fast.

Edit: I do want to say that having clear skin isn't my main driver for quitting smoking. It's the health and financial benefits that made me quit. My post-cigarette postules are just a good visual representation and reminder for the damage smoking does to the entire body, lungs and all. Wowwwwwww 5% retinoid from THE ORDINARY

‚Ä¢ Sometimes use The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% cream - about 3 or 4x a week.

I'm very pale so I like to use SPF everyday. I find that this one is good value for money, lightweight on the face, smells nice and is moisturizing. 

The Ordinary's Hyaluronic Acid is great value for money and helps to lock in moisture - using both of these products has definitely helped to keep my face nice and soft in winter without breaking the bank. I use The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension cream to reduce redness around my nose and under eye circles, which it helps a little with.

‚Ä¢ Remove makeup with The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter

‚Ä¢ Apply The Ordinary Gylcolic Acid 7% Toning Solution

‚Ä¢ Apply The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA

The Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter is one of the best makeup removers I've ever used. It's great for sensitive skin and leaves my skin very soft whilst metling away every trace of makeup. It also lasts ages so at ¬£11 a tin it's very good value for money. 

I then apply The Ordinary's Glycolic Acid Toning Solution with cotton pads, which leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. It's not too harsh for my sensitive skin and is, again, great value for the price. Definitely deserves its reputation! The moisturizer is great too - it's effective, light on the face, and, once again, CHEAP !

Every Sunday evening I try to use The Ordinary Peeling Solution. This is one of my favourite products in my routine; it really reduces the size of my pores, blackheads and the visibility of sebaceous filaments on my nose. I used to be addicted to squeezing and picking my nose but this product has saved me. This is my favorite post here so far Funny how divided the people are on your schelfie. I say huzzah to you! **reapplies sunscreen, sips G&T** How is the vitamin C suspension from TO? too real This reminds me of when I went to Poland, discovered Soplica, and tried all flavors in one weekend. No ragrets. When worlds collide.. Some of the best products that cause people to age I see. Cigs and alcohol would love to mount a gay Soplica <3 This was far to relatable please delete. Hehehe, Mount Gay. is that buckfast I spy in the back left? üëÄ Please take care of your health x The ordinary won‚Äôt reverse the aging effects of cigarettes man....doesn‚Äôt cure lung cancer either I feel so guilty doing my skincare routines on Friday's knowing I'm going to drink and smoke at night. Lol For a second I thought I posted this What fucking sub am I in?! I love it. I take really good care of my skin but I also like drinking and sometimes falling asleep in my makeup /r/3edgy5me Love the Body Shop Chamomile Cleansing Butter. I had been using the Pixi Double Cleanse (which I love and miss), but I can't find it anywhere in Canada now so I switched to the Chamomile. Ah yes, the deadly cycle. üòÇ I spend extra on my skincare to neutralize the free radicals from smoking weed every night because I‚Äôm so stressed about my skin routine. It‚Äôs a flawless plan The first thing i see is 'gay' :))) Probably wouldn't need so much of the right stuff if you cut out the left. You forgot the weed As long as you smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, no product on the planet will save your skin. I applaud your great choice of polish vodka! Chaotic neutral. I approve. I like you. Found my mood board fam. 

Also, to all the people like "sMoKiNg iS bAD >>::(((" everyone has their vices and stop acting like pure wee angels lmao Literally the story of my life Barbados eh? I see soplica,I upvote. I've never related more to anyone in my entire life! mount gay M O U N T  G A Y I always called this the YING AND THE YANG I also eat really healthy to get more ying , I told my therapist  this strategy and she said I  might just be a little crazy.  I stopped, it doesnt help for chronic stress but I dont beat myself if I light up for acute stress. 

&#x200B;

Acne causes stress. This is a relatable shelf I have no choice but to Stan The left keeps your heart happy. The right keeps your skin happy.
If my skincare don't work, at least my alcohol will. /s I love this mount gay haha I absolutely adore Mount Gay rum! My father taught me to make him a rum punch cocktail with Mount Gay when I was very young. I still make it the exact same way. I want to be apart of Mount Gay. Mount gay lmao The smoking reverses the skincare products and gives you yellow teeth. Liz the vitamin c from TO comparable to other popular Vitamin c serums such as drunk elephant or ole henriksen? Try the Mount Gay Black Barrel if you can find it. It's absolutely my favorite rum of theirs! LMAO I love this
I get so excited when other people are also obsessed with the ordinary haha Me for the entirety of my 20s: I smoke and drink and sleep in my makeup, why do I keep getting pimples?!?! Must be my damn genetics. Lol don't forget to add a glass of water in the right hand side now and then :) Bless. love it Honestly me to a tea R u ok? Yo can we just take a second to appreciate Soplica? Yang and more Yang Upvote for the Mount Gay as I live a few minutes from the distillery. I‚Äôll file this under ‚Äòthings I never thought I‚Äôd see on Reddit‚Äô. Hahaha I love this!!!
It‚Äôs so me... I also use The Ordinary products... Tesco vodka... ewwwww. Oh hi, are you me? I read a really great article about this! specifically about how France has like nationalized skin care and such great pharmacies because they want to live their lives by eating cheese and bread and drinking but still have good skin. respectüëå Mount gay hahha Mount Gay. Can we not glorify smoking on this sub? This post is perfect My favorite shelfie ever. Mount Gay is my favorite rum üò≠üò≠ I'm so impressed with your Mount Gay Rum ....you have impeccable taste in ALL things clearly! Respect +100 I don't do the first one and yet need the second one for similar problems. FML [deleted] It bothers me so much how he‚Äôs doing more damage than cure Quitting smoking should be a priority, especially with coronavirus on the brink of a pandemic... [deleted] you seem to act good and bad at the same time.... knowing the magic and doing the tricks... Works both ways. it's all about balance friends This guy AAs That's how I quit too. If I wanted one Id buy a pack, smoke one and give/throw the rest away. Those cigarettes became $12 a piece and it was pretty good incentive to stop. Those zits are a blessing. Props for quitting! I‚Äôve seen how destructive the addiction can be, I don‚Äôt think people get enough credit for quitting. You made the right choice. My skin got better after quitting smoking too! Not in terms of breakouts, it just got a lot less dull. My 67 year old male coworker told me I looked ‚Äúmuch more radiant‚Äù I recently learned an interesting tidbit that might help you in your quitting endeavors.

Frame of mind can play a huge role in how easily someone quits. If you consider yourself ‚Äú a smoker that is quitting‚Äù you‚Äôre more likely to go back. But if you view yourself as ‚Äúa former smoker‚Äù you‚Äôre much less likely to continue.

Humans are really good at self-fulfilling prophecies. Our outlook really does play a big role in our actions. I wish you the best of luck in this endeavor! I have a similar experience only except cigarettes it‚Äôs Dr Pepper I‚Äôm quitting (day 7!) and it‚Äôs making me break out :/ I hope I end up with better skin than when I was smoking but right now I look like shit. Just here to comment ‚ÄúAllen Carr‚Äôs Easy Way‚Äù that book changed my life!! Been smoke free since the day I finished it years ago, never had any nicotine since. Go Vaping mate. It‚Äôs a little bit hard to start, but it removes all the really awful aspects of smoking but you can still enjoy the process. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Same w me w vaping. Surprisingly smoking cigs does nothing to my skin. Vape for a couple days and I have bad cystic acne. You can order The Ordinary products not available in Canada from Cult Beauty! I get my Azelaic Acid from there and shipping is fast and super cheap. This is a granactive retinoid. 5 pct here is not equavilant of 5 pct retinol. Beautybay has it! I buy it from there. Ships fast and the shipping fee isn't expensive Why would a Canadian brand have a product that‚Äôs not even available in their country? Sorry I'm a newbie. What does this product do and why is it better to get the 5%? [deleted] They literally invented rum. Went on a tour once and got drunk from the samples. It‚Äôs in Barbados Don‚Äôt mind if I do I need to get myself a case of that. It‚Äôs very very tasty rum, and only $1 or $2 more per bottle than Bacardi. Very affordable and super high quality. Same haha.. forgot the Jameson tho :P Saaaame. Throw some cocaine on there and we‚Äôre golden. Same. Swap the smokes for a vape and maybe add in some single barrel jack Felt like you would put the alcool in your PM Routine When do you apply the rum tho? I dont mean to criticize but it seems like your process is out of order. Spf/moisturizer always goes on last, which is especially important when your using stong actives and exfoliants like you listed that make skin more sensitive.  And where is your moisturizer before bed at the end of PM routine? great post, would add drugs to it..

Can i ask why do you use HA after moister? how do you deal with shiny-ness that HA brings? ‚ÄòMon the Bucky! Bucky you must be a Scot! How's that Tesco value stuff? Try mixing the hazelnut vodka with milk (50/50 to start). You will not be disappointed. Yes! Thank you for this comment. I'm sure OP is capable enough to make own choices. It's not our place to judge. It's effective, but it's not my favorite. It's really harsh, gritty, and it has an unpleasant industrial smell. It definitely reduced my PIH, but I still wouldn't recommend it. Check out Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum as an alternative. It's a lot of vitamin c which in itself is an acid. The stuff can tingle or even burn when putting it on. That being said, it's just doing its job which is getting vit c into your skin. I think a few times a week is the most my skin can handle. Tried doing more frequently and it was not a pleasant experience. The other brand vit c serums are certainly more pleasant and don't bother my skin in the least but I feel like they also don't do the job nearly as well. I know I know. There's only so much The Ordinary can do for me Particularly one who takes care of his skin! omg it is! Lung cancer is just one of the many things cigarettes cause. Mouth, skin, stomach, bladder, kidney cancer as well. Also peripheral vascular disease, heart attacks, high blood pressure. A lot more things I'm forgetting now im quitting after uni i swear I just consider it a win whenever my drunk ass remembers to do skincare instead of passing out in a full face of makeup. I swear I wouldn‚Äôt even have acne if it wasn‚Äôt for those nightsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And it's say cigarettes will show much more damage. We all drunk socially (I'm convinced the ones 100% sober look about the same as the ones drinking socially because they don't take the edge off and stress gets to them) but you can really see the effect off smoking on the skin when people turn about 35-40. Not to mention the nasty cough the smokers get when they age as if they are about to spit their lungs out Innit like I am actually aware a skin care routine won't save me from lung cancer u weapons Yea honestly I have to agree I'd love to read this if u have a link üëåüëåüëå I realise I'm not helping my skin with my poor life style choices, but IMO that doesn't mean I should just fuck off looking after myself entirely does it now What's the point of going to the gym if you're going to eat fast food once a week? What's the point in living if you're just gonna die anyway? live fast die young bad gurls do it well I'm a girl I'm afraid ! duality of wo(man) Eudaimonia. Just missing weed and this would be a perfect pic! For some reason my skin looks great after I drink? My friend breaks out a lot however. Also a great way to stop. I've definitely trashed a mostly full pack of smokes the day after (usually because I've been drinking or hanging out with smokers). I'm always amazed at how disgusted I am with myself. Then a few weeks later something stressful happens and I get the urge to smoke. Thankfully I've been working on managing my anxiety and stress in a healthier way. They truly are. My skin working extra hard to help keep my lungs healthy!! Thanks! I'm super happy I did. I'm getting better and better and going longer without breaking down and opting for a smoke. And my body just feels so much better as well! Thanks! That's interesting. More and more I see myself as a former smoker, and don't really view myself as a current smoker. I can totally see how important that mind shift is! Ive heard some interesting things about the food coloring in Dr. Pepper and what it does to people. All anecdotal but there‚Äôs clearly something going on. Good for you! 

Be patient, maybe your skin is still purging. It can take awhile for skin to purge.

Or are you picking more? Eating more? I'm a knitter so transitioning from smoking to spending more time on knitting was a good way to occupy my hands. Pick up a new hobby if you need to keep your hands busy.

Good luck! You can do this!!!!! In very vape averse. I don't want to trade one addiction for another. I know it's helpful to some, but it's not something I want to support or spend money on.

These days I don't really get cravings unless I'm around a smoker and I'm drinking. I'm pretty happy with my progress so far :) Oh, interesting, are you sure the products are authentic and not super old? do you need a prescription for it ? I use it for my neck (tret causes irritation there.) Been great. Sometimes I think my neck looks better than my face üòÖ My fucking point exactly :/ you literally cant get numerous of their most popular products here cuz of our regulations for over the counter products :( essentially, they want you to go get treatments done with insurance or go pay for it in full with a professional üòû‚úäüèæ üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà ‚ÄúBrokeback Mountain 2: Ram Ranch‚Äù I thought that was Back-Poke Mountain And the price of it anywhere outside of Barbados is extortion :( Recommended then? I really like their rum but i love cuban rum more. Own brand vodka is my holy grail product TO NMF is a moisturizer, so she has one at the end of PM (unless that was edited in after).

Co-sign the spf comment - def should come last IMO. ah yeah ur right, ketamine is great for the skin, u don't tend to notice ur pimples when u have forgotten who u are entirely

and no, i don't find it makes me too shiny! the HA is already in the moisturiser and i find it is asborbed quickly and leaves little greasiness Haha i'm actually from the north of England but it's pretty easy to find there. the south of England is a different story...moved here for uni and the lack of bucky is simply despicable I've been considering this one for a while! Have you tried dermadoctor kakadu C? When I actually use I mix it with vanacream,which most likely wastes it but I haven‚Äôt looked into it enough. Not my favorite product at all I have been able to give up alcohol at least (14 months so far)... still working on giving up the cancer sticks tho  :( Well as long as you know. Some people wonder why they age hella fast and nothing helps their skin; come to find out they are chain smokers that drink heavily Saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it tomorrow‚Äù is the surest way to never do it trust me Holy fuck, cigs are so bad my dude. I smoked for nine years and quit after getting onto patches. You don't realise how gross they are until you stop. I am sending you willpower to overcome the ciggies, all the best. Also good luck in uni. My dad died when he was 32 of lung cancer. I was 1 year old. I don't have a single memory of him. It took my mom 11 years after that to get over his death, after spending a literal decade raising me and my sister alone. I used to say that - I ended up finally quitting when I was 28. Can't change the past but I wish had quit sooner. FYI it's going to be hard whenever you do it, so might as well get started sooner rather than later. i smoked cigarettes for about 5 years and i feel so much better now that i quit. you can totally do it i believe in you!! after you stop youll wonder why you ever smoked I swear this is exactly what I say to people. "No more fags or Bucky after uni, I swear down" but now I'm applying for post grads. üôÉ Please do. I smoked for 15 years then quit a year after graduating. It's hard, but you won't regret it. You'll have so much more energy and extra time to do stuff. Why not quit today? You'll need [this then.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/7wnym8/did_anyone_else_use_allen_carrs_book/) BEYTA Food is going to taste delicious when you quit. I know you got this when you‚Äôre ready.is that glycolic acid in the bigger bottle and how do you like it [deleted] I disagree, I know smokers in their late 20's that look like they are 40 because of smoking. Alcohol, no matter how much is consumed, causes the face to bloat and sag. I do not drink for that very reason. Yeah, at least you get it. You said you're gonna quick after uni right? Nicotine gum, maybe the patches, and cut up straws to mimic movements will help. My mom used those to quit. https://theoutline.com/post/8395/french-skincare-is-the-future?zd=2&zi=ei2whsnl Smoking isnt the equivalent of eating fast food once a week, its the equivalent to eating fast food for every meal, seriously, smoking is horrific. [deleted] My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard! Oh, you've yet to see my room then. üòÇ It's because they are possessed me too it‚Äôs so weird the day after i drink i‚Äôm always like wtf my skin looks so good I started vaping to quit smoking. I got a little pod like vape that tickled the back of my throat like a cigarette would, and found a flavor that could satisfy my taste for tobacco. I did that for about a year, first at 6mg of nicotine, then 3mg. I decided at the start of this year I‚Äôd try out the 0mg and after about a month of vaping with no nicotine, I kinda don‚Äôt care about it anymore.

It‚Äôs good to know it‚Äôs there if I need it. And if I get super stressed I can use it. I think the tickle in the back of my throat is enough of a placebo effect that it doesn‚Äôt bother me that there‚Äôs no nicotine.

I also hate the taste of actual cigarettes now so that helps a bunch. 

I feel like I kinda panic a bit when it comes to just stopping. The thought of just stopping makes me want to smoke/vape more. Like hoarding food out of fear you‚Äôll starve. I need to like, have it available but not care about it. Thanks! Haven‚Äôt been picking I think it‚Äôs just my hormones shifting after quitting. I smoked like 5-10 cigs a day for almost 10 years. I‚Äôve been running! I feel amazing physically and mentally but my face just looks kind of sad üòÇ 
Good job to you as well! If you can quit, it‚Äôs amazing. I was thinking you still smoking. It's basically a third-party retailer, like beauty bay, ulta, sephora, etc Nope! All of the Ordinary stuff is over the counter. Canada just has some weird regulations. I am by no means knowledgeable about rum but I liked it and would recommend visiting the place. And Barbados is beautiful OP added TO hydrating + HA to the post after my comment. I know its a moisturizer because i use it lol Hey, I'd recommend going to check out r/stopsmoking and also purchase allen carr's book - The Easyway to Stop Smoking. Changed my life and I'm almost 4 years nic free after smoking almost a pack a day for 7. You can do it! Best of luck, you can do it! Think of all the products you could be stocking up on instead You think there are really people who don‚Äôt know this? No more cigs after highschool graduation >

 after university >

 after I get into a long term relationship >

after I have kids >

after they're old enough to remember >

eh my bodies already damaged so continuing wont change much Well I‚Äôm not smoking cigs, a juul instead, but it‚Äôs because every time I try to quit my entire life goes to shit and I pick it back up. This time my ex came back out of the blue and has been sending paragraphs every night about how he‚Äôs sorry for cheating and wants to be together again. I‚Äôm stressed as hell, had to go back to the nic to avoid my ex I think I might just read the book, even though I've never touched a cig in my life (except for that one time, but thankfully my pickiness thought the taste of ass was worse than the benefits from a headrush). The claims people make about the book are crazy, I want to know what it says/how it does what it does. AMAZIN' While I agree with you and for many people that's the case. for me personally it helps to keep me sane (I'm a CPA and there is an inside joke in the profession that we're functioning alcoholics lol ) I'm not saying alcohol will do no damage. It absolutely will. But from seeing people who smoke their skin looks way worse IMO Wow reddit seems to be a bit confused as to which stance to upvote. Oh, trust me, my room has duality It's because the vision is still a bit blurry :> I could have written this same thing! 

I recently stepped down to 6mg and then 3 mg. Even just using the lower nicotine level I find I don‚Äôt reach for it quite as much. The thought of quitting stresses me out like you said (I kept a half pack of cigs in my center console for a year after I quit smoking) so I‚Äôm glad dropping the nic level just naturally has me wanting it less! 

I tried to smoke a cig a few times last summer (when drinking) and each time I got like 1/3 way into it and had to put it out. The taste grossed me out soooo much now. 

Glad you were able to go down to 0mg so easily! That‚Äôs a daunting step for me This is me, only I quit smoking cigarettes about 9 years ago and I still have a vape. I didn't intend to quit smoking cigarettes, it just happened. I've worked the nicotine down to zero but I still use the vape from time to time when I'm stressed. Every now and then while out with friends I use nicotine vape if drinking. Can't stand a regular cigarette anymore and luckily none of my friends smoke. It's that tickle in the back of my throat I crave, not the rush. I was wondering about that, if by the time you got down to zero mg if you would either still be addicted to the habit of it or if you wouldn't think about it much. I smoked for 17 years and back in 2012 I finally got the patch to work except for my bedtime smoke, so I decided to try vaping again because it had changed a lot since the one I bought in 2008 that looked like a cigarette and tasted like a cigarette left in a wet ash tray. Back then it was either tobacco or menthol and they were both just nasty. I was using 6mg but I was using a subohm tank for a few years and because of the flavor ban in my state I started diy my eliquid, which I should have done a long time ago because I was getting really grossed out by how insanely sweet eliquid had become. It wasn't like that when I first started and I would actually get an extra flavor shot added. But when I switched to subohm I started having to buy the cheaper eliquids because I was going through it too fast. My cheeks and gums were becoming inflamed and it felt like I had been sucking on warheads for hours. I now know it's the mass amount of sucrose or whatever sweetner they add, because I followed someone else's recipe one day and it called for more sweetner than I had ever used and sure enough it irritated my mouth. I quit using my sub ohm tank and I am using pods, but now I am up to 20mg, ugh. I was at 24mg for a month and dropped down and I plan to keep doing that until I am nicotine free and hopefully have your experience of not thinking about it.

I know I will never smoke a cigarette again, the smell makes me nauseous now. Even when I smoked I was bothered by that nasty ash tray smell that some smokers smell like. Just be cautious in Canada of where you order from and to double check that all products are authentic. Recently marketing tests have shown that there is a lot of counterfeits on online retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Aliexpress, Wish, etc. that contain heavy metals well in excess of what is legally allowed for cosmetics. Some contain high levels of lead, other mercury, and the list goes on. 

Just gotta make sure Cult Beauty only sells authentic products, and when ordering online its hard to validate that before purchase unfortunately. Also verify that Cult Beauty or any third party retailer is not a "marketplace" type of set up as that can increase the chances of toxic fakes mixing in with authentic products. 

Canada has a big issue at the moment with dangerous counterfeits and its good to be extra cautious particularly in cosmetic products. Sweet! thank you!! checking the website now. Im pumpppped There‚Äôs a good amount of young people on here. What better way to sell them on not smoking than to appeal to their vanity, especially now that smoking has made a huge comeback? I‚Äôm all for saying it as often as is needed. I think it's mostly denial. Yep Sounds like you need to block the ex and keep moving upwards and onwards! Whenever you kill a habit, you have to replace it with a new one. Juul is definitely better than cigs, but still not great.

Hope it works out for you. What's a CPA?

I have a friend who makes the "functioning alcoholic" joke but I'm not sure how well he's functioning. The alcohol is definitely not helping his life. Though his skin is better than mine so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø I've never been drunk. mmm not really cause i have videos of my skin after drinking in which it looks different It‚Äôs hard to enjoy the taste of cigs after awhile of vaping! Early on in vaping when I would have the occasional cigarette, I remember I would think to myself ‚Äúman, I can get the same effect from my vape and not have to deal with this smell/taste.‚Äù And then the next day I‚Äôd be coughing up phlegm and stuff. Really pushed me off of cigarettes and onto the vape. 

And if it helps at all, I planned to try 0mg with no commitment to it. Just like a test run. If it really bothered me I fully planned to go back to 3mg for a while longer. Luckily it hasn‚Äôt bothered me yet! 

I was totally expecting to be glued to my vape trying to get that non-existent nicotine hit. And that probably was me for the first two weeks. But nothing bad in terms of cravings. No ‚Äúomg I need to smoke/vape NOW‚Äù feelings. Just vaping a bit more than usual, which has now turned into ‚Äúdo I wanna vape? Ehhh I‚Äôm ok for right now.‚Äù Yeah, I knew when going into vaping that it wouldn‚Äôt work for me unless I could get that throat tickle. 

I still get nostalgic for cigarettes whenever I see someone smoking on TV though, but then I think about the taste and the coughing and the phlegm and the initial dizzy spell I‚Äôm bound to get, and it just kinda turns me off. Cult beauty is a pretty legit company IMO and I think they are UK based I'm part of a skincare group on Facebook that is mostly based in UK. Cult beauty is their Sephora since they don't have a brick and mortar Sephora, so I'm pretty sure it's legit. Totally agree!  Cult Beauty is a UK based Sephora-like retailer, same with Beauty Bay! They just happen to ship to Canada. Overal this is great info. Learned this one the hard way when I got fake pravana off amazon and my hair ended up a completely different colour. Others have said it already but cult beauty is legit! I order off them all the time How can you tell if it's authentic? I got the red The Ordinary face mask from Amazon. Smokers are aware. It‚Äôs addiction, not denial. You're not from the US I take it?  :) Certified public accountant. tax laws in the US are very complex and we work cause hours (during busy season which ends up being close to 6 months we work 50-80 hours) and we don't work less than 40 - those of us working for firms doing taxes and audits and advisory for other companies. So at the end of those crazy weeks when you have no energy for anything else nothing feels as good as a glass of wine (or whiskey, or beer, or whatever other liquor). I've seen multiple articles saying a glass of wine per day is good for you. 

Everything is good on moderation I guess. Except smoking ... Even moderate amount can kill you That's good to hear, I just wanted to mention to people that research should always be done on online retailers, including ones that they are not familiar with. I mean it is a good practice to have considering that even authentic products should be spot tested if they are new for you, and with the amount of counterfeit cosmetics erring on cautious is good practice. So some stuff they mentioned was looking for any spelling errors on the packaging, and comparing the product info with the stuff on the official website. Eg. Is the labelling the same, does the product exist in the same line as the website. One product the pointed out was Luxe Danger Lady Red lipstick from Mac (iirc). Issue is that Mac does produce Danger Lady Red but only as Matte line product and not Luxe line. 

Also the advice is more geared for Canadian markets since stopping counterfeit products at the border has been very low (like over the course of a year 69 products were seized compared with thousands in the US). Why not both Totally agree. I have gotten expired product before Thanks! I am in Canada, but the product came from China if that helps. Be cautious as IP theft is common in China. Funny enough IP theft is kinda common in many large nations that played catch up historically (eg. the US in the 19th c.)

But yeah be cautious, here is the article:

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* ugh. i love that neutrogena moisturizer with SPF but it flushes my whole face beet red. I've been trying to find something similar that wasn't a chemical sunscreen I love your illustration. It looks so nice! I have acne-prone skin and have been using Differin nightly to clear up consistent breakouts on my chin, around my mouth, and on my cheeks. The jojoba oil I started using years ago and loved the way it made my skin feel moisturized without being overly greasy. I was initially using this as my primary moisturizer, but after browsing this subreddit, I learned it works better as an occlusive that seals all the moisture and product in at the end. I wear higher SPF sunscreen if I‚Äôm going outside at all, but the Neutrogena has worked well for me as a daily moisturizer in the morning with the added bonus of SPF. The soap on the right is Meow Meow Tweet tea tree charcoal facial soap. Haha omg I saw this and was like WAIT I use those products!! This is so cute! You‚Äôre so talented! Yay someone else who uses TJs jojoba oil! It‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve used to oil cleanse that doesn‚Äôt break me out. Love the illustration! So creative and the colours are so bright and happy :) This is so awesome and CUTE! Do you have an insta or anything with more of your illustrations?! So talented!! Omg this is amazing! Did you use procreate for this? Looks AMAZING! Who doesn‚Äôt love Jojoba oil?!? Love you illustrations!! God this is calming. I want it to frame it and hang it as wall candy in my bathroom. That illustration is bomb! I also have the Trader Joe's jojoba oil and it's great, but it's annoying to try to dispense without making a mess. Do you do anything special to portion it out better?  Cool! Do you find that the jojoba oil is good for OCM? I‚Äôve been wanting to try it as I think I have a lot of dirt and oil in my pores i wanna get out ahh i love this! the color scheme and idea is so cute! That Differin gel though.... I thought this was an ad at first glance! Love it This is so cute! I also love the fonts used on the bottles! You are very talented! üíï Damn, your art is cool I love this so much! Good to see someone else uses the Trader Joe's jojoba oil! initially i thought this was an ad for CeraVe! so talented!! So pretty! You know you're a skin care nerd when an image like this makes you happy :) this is so cute I love this! I really want these as stickers now! Edit: just read that you wear additional sunscreen is going outside! :)

I‚Äôve heard that the lotion with sunscreen doesn‚Äôt have enough sunscreen concentration to be as effective, just like makeup with sunscreen doesn‚Äôt have enough unless you add like 10x what you would actually use. Is this correct? I love the cerave am lotion but always supplement with their dedicated sunscreen. Just wanna make sure everyone is using adequate sunscreen!!! 

I just got back into jojoba oil after mistakenly thinking it was breaking me out (a nasty coconut oil cleanser was) and my skin loves itttt. I know you have to be careful with brands and that TJs is great. Woah I use cerve u guys are out of hand and now I'm one of u Ahhh I love this illustration and the colors so much. Also love your routine!! Dat limited color scheme! Love it. This is so good I thought it was an ad before reading the caption! That‚Äôs pretty darn cute! Omg this is so aesthetically pleasing Love the colours! It looks wonderful!

I also love jojoba oil for my skin This is so adorable. I really like this and want to see more!!! Are you on Instagram or anything?? :) This is SO good. I love the color palette! I almost scrolled past this bc it looks so much like an ad for some reason Love it! I like how you moved the white lineart from the coloring to create some ‚Äùnoise‚Äù in the illustration. I like that. Love this! Very well made! Please share more of your illustrations or a link to your insta! I love the pic! omg this is so adorable I love this! Also I love Trader Joe's jojoba oil so much it's one of my favorites! Jojoba is life!!! This is so cute, and you've got some HGs there. Loving the colour scheme, as well! This is the cutest photo. I would totally print this and hang it up in my bathroom. Do you have an etsy page or anything? The colour scheme is gorgeous!! You nailed the lines on these bottles, and the colors are great. Cool style, please do more! I love this.

&#x200B;

Also where in the world do you find jojoba oil? I live in a small town and there is only grocery stores. I might have to go online but I never liked getting skin care products online because I can never be sure of what I'm getting (if its a dupe, expired, etc). this is so cool!! i draw my skincare products for drawing homework all the time when i can‚Äôt think of anything else lmao That is such a cute idea and it looks amazing, I imagine you pinning this up beside the bathroom mirror for sleepy mornings when you can't remember the routine. Love it ! [deleted] Wow I love this ideaaaa So cool!!! This is so beautifully done!!! I‚Äôd love to see more of your work This is so cuteeeee!! which the ordinary product are you using? its so cute! What kind of cleanser do you use? Also, thanks for the info on jojoba oil, I‚Äôm recently On the hunt for an occlusive for my dehydrated skin. You need more than 15 spf! At least 30 according to my derm. I want to use the Differn gel but I‚Äôm so afraid of the purge .. üò≠ [this is all I think about when I see jojoba](https://youtu.be/6xxNRZ6i95A) This is such a well done illustration, very interesting and bright color pallet. The art style doesnt over power showing the products, yet is still cute and 'cartoony'. Love this idea and execution!

It's such a simple addition to routines and I'm new to getting serious about skincare, but jojoba changed my life. Years of prescription acne treatments didn't help as much as using jojoba to help even out my dry and oily spots. so do u moisturise twice cos u got both cerave and moisturising neutrogena there ? I could‚Äôve sworn this was an ad as I scrolled by!! I'm a lover of kukui nut oil. Hair, skin, body. Not food though, it's a strong diarrhetic ‚ÑìœÉ‚Ñì I lived in Hawaii for 2 years. Your illustration is adorable! I wish I could do things like that. Also I like your simple skincare routine. this is so cuute!! ü•∞ i love your illustration style! I love this illustration!!! ü•∞ Image traced them in illustrator**

But still pretty Lovely illustration OP! Can I please ask you or anyone, where do I find 0.1% differin in the uk? Only seems to be 5% or 10% available over the counter. ugh i've been meaning to try the ordinary but keep forgetting...i literally love this [removed] It‚Äôs so handy to have moisturizer + SPF in one! But I have noticed that it can be a little irritating to the skin around my eyes, so when I run out I might also be looking for something similar without that reaction. Neutrogena makes another oil-free moisturizer for sensitive skin that does not contain the SPF.  I have been using it for several months and I like it a lot. I'm very sensitive to chemical sunscreen as well. I had this same issue, friend introduced me to the aveeno ultra calming daily moisturizer w spf and I loooooove it! Just a question, and I really don't mean that sarcastic in any way but I'm curious. What do you love about it if it flushes your whole face red? i really like this moisturizer too and recently got it! My face likes the non-spf versions of this Neutrogena, but the spf one stung my eyes like whoa. After much trial and error I found the CeraVe Ultra Light with spf 30  moisturizer. Love it!!! I have combo to oily skin and do it like heavy feeling moisturizers during the day. This one really is ultra light. It‚Äôs fragrance free too! Hey I use the exact same one but it's labelled as 'for sensitive skin' with no spf because I was having similar problem, so far it's been really good! I have crazy sensitive skin. Even some of the sensitive skin sunscreens make me go red or burn; and when they don‚Äôt, I break out. Recently someone out me on to the Mermaid sunscreen by canmake. It‚Äôs so good. It‚Äôs not oily; I don‚Äôt break out; and no sensitivity from it. Only painful thing is it‚Äôs hard to get and it isn‚Äôt the cheapest (though not crazy expensive). I‚Äôve only found it on amazon. I have super sensitive face skin as well and am definitely allergic or sensitive to something in the Neutrogena product. I found that the trader joes enrich daily facial moisturizer with spf works pretty well on my skin and doesn't make it burn. Clinique mineral sunscreen. It‚Äôs the only thing I can wear. Omg this happened to me too, except with the version without SPF! I had no clue what was going on at first; I thought maybe my shower was too hot. I wonder which ingredient causes this to happen! Thank you so much! Do you use a cleanser at all? Do you mind telling me what order you use your products in? Have you seen any results for the Niacinamide?  I‚Äôm thinking of buying it for acne scars and dark spots, but I was wondering if it worked for others. Have you been using that for a while? How do you like it? Is it gentle enough to use every day? I love your illustration!! I'm thinking of switching out my benzoyl peroxide face wash for the meow meow tweet bar. Do you find that the tea tree oil in the bar helps with breakouts? Or is it just more of a cleanser? I ask because I just started differin and don't want to use something too irritating, and noticed that you use differin as well. Yes! I also love that it‚Äôs so cheap at TJ and lasts forever [deleted] I started oil cleansing with it too!!!! I love it!! Thank you! I had fun choosing the color scheme for this I use a Wacom Intuos tablet in Photoshop :) Wondering the same thing (regarding which program or app you used!!) Thanks! I was having the same issue with the oil getting everywhere. I bought a couple of 2oz dropper bottles online and fill those with oil instead. Not OP, but I've used jojoba oil to oil cleanse for years and I love it. I do a second cleanse afterwards since my skin is on the oilier side. I use Trader Joe‚Äôs jojoba oil (3+ years now I believe) for my first cleanse. It‚Äôs legit HG for me. Effective and keeps my skin hydrated in the process. Never caused any congestion or breakouts for me. Yes, it is a great oil for that because the makeup of the oil is very similar to the sebum skin naturally produces. So it doesn‚Äôt clog pores or make me break out at all. You should treat any product containing SPF like you would a dedicated SPF product - i.e. applying the necessary amount and making sure to reapply throughout the day. Doesn't matter if it's a mattifying SPF, a moisturizer with SPF in it, or a foundation with SPA in it - if they all have the same level of sun protection (for instance, SPF 30), you'd need to apply the same amount in order for it to work properly, no matter the type of product. Some products (like moisturizers) are better suited for applying large quantities than others (like makeup with SPF - you can't just put a ton of it on with it still looking good). Wow thanks! Do you have a Trader Joe's near you? That's where the one in the illustration is from :) I use a Wacom Intuos tablet in Photoshop Looks like their Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Serum It‚Äôs the niacinamide + zinc solution! Thank you! I use Meow Meow Tweet tea tree and charcoal facial soap as a cleanser. Jojoba oil has worked well for me, I hope you find something you like as well! Thank you! I agree, jojoba is the best! It totally changed my skin Im pretty sure differin (adapalene) isnt avaible in 5% or 10%. That would be waaaayyy to strong. Maybe you‚Äôre confusing it with benzoyl peroxide. This does come in higher %. The lowest would be 2.5%. Im not sure if differin (adapalene) is OTC in the UK. To each their own! This is what works for me :) [removed] My derm recommended the neutrogena sheer zinc dry-touch sunscreen. I have pretty sensitive skin and it‚Äôs been great for me! I use this version as well. I used to use the Mary Kay‚Äôs botanical moisturizer until it was discontinued. My friend tried to swindle me with the MK time wise face cream, but it has the SPF and my face hated it. Love that moisturiser for my skin, however there is something in it that stings my eyes quite severely. Had to stop using it :/ It absorbs nicely and has a nice consistency. My face only gets beet red if something else triggers my rosacea while the moisturizer is on. The rest of the time it works and I like it Morning routine:

- Splash of water
- Neutrogena moisturizer 
- Sunscreen 

Night:
- Meow Meow Tweet tea tree + charcoal facial soap (cleanser)
- Differin 
- TO Niacinamide + Zinc
- CeraVe moisturizing lotion 
- Jojoba oil I‚Äôve used it for about 3 years! It‚Äôs very gentle and smells amazing. I use the bar only for my face and it lasts about 8 months. They also place a huge emphasis on sustainability with their products which I love. The tea tree oil definitely isn‚Äôt irritating. I haven‚Äôt noticed that it specifically helps with breakouts though, I started seeing results when I used Differin. If I have a full face of makeup on I usually use 3 or 4 drops, but it only takes a drop or two to take off just my sunscreen. I massage for 30 secs to a minute and then go in with my second cleanser (pacifica cosmic hemp) It lasts forever since a little goes such a long way! That's a great idea, I'll have to try that! Thanks! May I ask if it doesn't get too oily to apply jojoba oil after the moisturizer? 

 I love jojoba oil as moisturizer :) The closest Trader Joe's to me is three hours away. And I don't even drive Hey, /u/lildarka & /u/StudentOnOSAP, I wanted to let you know that this comment chain has been removed because it was breaking Rule 1: Be kind and respectful.

[removed] I can only wear zinc screens and this one is my fav! I've been using the Neutrogena zinc baby sunscreen, works good for me, just trying to find a moisturizer combo with physical SPF. But I don't know if anyone makes that. I cannot for the life of me get oil to work after moisturizer. And I use the same brands you do! I wonder what's wrong.

They seem to combine and curl up and solidify :( I stopped using oil as a result and I miss it terribly. I love the illustration!!

Splash of water  in the morning and only moisturize my skin have been the major game changers for me too, yay!!!  I've been using sunscreen for years but because of the quarantine I only apply it if I go out to the supermarket :D

That, along with Dr. Davin Lim, Cassandra Bankson and Dr. Drey videos have changed my acne-prone skin. Overall: the less, the better. Thanks!! That sounds awesome! I might try it! ok, thank you :) [removed] You might like to try the [Peter Thomas Roth Max Mineral Naked SPF 45 lotion](https://www.sephora.com/product/max-mineral-naked-broad-spectrum-spf-45-P430812). That's my HG. I find it moisturizing enough but I have oily-combo skin for reference. It's also a better primer than all of my actual primers. I get the best results when I wait about 5-10 min in between each step! Once I put moisturizer on, I wait for it to dry and then do the oil - it seems to work well Try to add a few drops to moisturizer in the palm of your hand. The TO marula oil mixes really well with all the moisturizers I have tried. [removed] Dumb that this comment was downvoted. Like, you're right that to prevent pilling you shouldn't have extra product sitting on the skin unabsorbed. But you also don't need to wait so long for most products if you pat them in to full absorption! Personally I notice substantially better hydration/plumpness if I pat stuff in, vs. letting it evaporate off my skin. Ohhhhh! Combining not layering. Of COURSE. Great advice, thank you! You‚Äôre right that I probably don‚Äôt need to wait so long :) I usually go do other stuff while I wait and it ends up being several minutes! I‚Äôll have to try patting it in Totally agree! Just noticed this myself as I‚Äôve been layering hydrating serum, moisturizer and oils. Patting it into my skin has been a game changer. **Hi everyone!

Reviews

**Vanicream Gentle Cleanser-** HG cleanser! I love the consistency and my skin doesn't feel tight after using. 

**Garenier Water Rose Micellar Cleansing Water**\- I like this stuff. It smells nice and doesn't leave a strange film feeling on my skin afterwards. Might repurchase. Might go for another micellar water. 

**Pixi Rose Tonic-** This feels really nice to use. It smells nice and feels nice, but I'm not sure it really does anything. Probably won't repurchase. *Is there anything I should use for this step instead?*

**Pixi Glow Tonic-** This is my newest addition to my routine. I felt like I needed to add a gentle exfoliant since my skin was looking a little dull. I really like this stuff! My skin definitely has more of a fresh glow to it since I added it in. I might switch to the TO Glycolic Acid after I finish this because of the rave reviews. However, in the mean time I'm very happy with this. 

**TO Hyaluronic Acid + B5-** The hype is real! HG status right here! This stuff makes my skin look plump and feel hydrated. I just turned 30 this year and this stuff helps to minimize my fine lines. Love! Will ALWAYS purchase. 

**TO Azelaic Acid-** Another HG right here. When I was diagnosed with rosacea my derm prescribed Finacea foam 15%.  I loved the sample he sent me home with, but my insurance wouldn't cover it so it was like $300 a tube. Nope! So, I tried this stuff out instead and over the course of a few weeks my redness and my papules were greatly improved and eventually gone! I also noticed that the mouth zits I get from my period also improved when I started using this.  Will definitely repurchase. 

**TO Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA-**  My skin likes this moisturizer a lot. It's solid. Not much else to say here. Will definitely repurchase.

**TO Rosehip Oil-** I started adding a drop or two into my nighttime moisturizer step in an effort to seal everything in. Oh my gosh! This stuff is awesome! It makes the NMF feel so decadent! It doesn't make me feel overly oily. I also believe this stuff has worked wonders for old acne scars and a few fine lines near my eyes. Will definitely repurchase. 

**Clinique Pep Start SPF 50-** This is probably my least favorite item in my current routine.  Its fine. It feels a little heavy, but not overly so. The tint is nice and subtle, but it leaves my skin slightly shinier than I would like. My skin doesn't seem to hate it, so I'll use it until its empty. I've been on a mission to find a good everyday SPF (bonus points if it is tinted) and so far everything has felt...meh. Won't repurchase.  I'll probably look into the Asian sunscreens this sub seems to love next.

**TO Salicylic Acid-** I only use this occasionally as a spot treatment for pimples on my face or body. It seems to work ok for speeding up the process, but not a miracle worker by any means. üòªü•∞üòª Wow. My skincare would take up 10 drawers.. instead it‚Äôs everywhere I rarely comment but it‚Äôs so pretty and nice to look at. Go you Can I ask an odd question - did you have to come to peace with laying everything down like that? It might just be an oddity of my mind, but I feel so...bad laying them down like that. This is so pretty though I love it! I thought I was on r/organizationporn . This makes me happy to look at. I LOVE THE ORGANIZATION üíúüíú Shoutout to Marie Kondo. The reason it isn‚Äôt stressful to open any of my drawers lol I‚Äôm amazed that you‚Äôre willing to keep bottles on their sides lol. I‚Äôm always terrified that something will leak all over the place The salicylic acid üò≠ I've been waiting for a restock for so long, I just used my last tiny emergency drop for a spot on my cheek. I miss it so much. How do you like the Love Beauty and Plant deodorant?? I want to try it but I'm hesitant, because what if doesn't work! As a person that hates cotton balls and waste, can I recommend you give reusable face wipes a try? They make small ones with ultra-soft cotton or bamboo that you can use once (or sometimes twice if they're big enough) before you need to wash them. Very satisfying organization though! The pixi skincare line is so underrated. My skin is a little splotchy/uneven in places, and I swear to god if I put on just the the vitamin c it looks like I‚Äôm wearing foundation. HUGE fan of their collagen eye cream- I occasionally put it on my forehead and it pretty much erases my wrinkles there. Just want to say this here because it‚Äôs important: don‚Äôt put qtips in your ears. My wife got a horrible ear infection that took weeks and a course of antibiotics to get under control. I have had impacted wax countless times. 

Qtips are now banned in my house. They are dangerous. And addictive. Where did you get the little organizing bins? My drawers are a MESS and I've been trying to find ways to organize. WOW. This is such a satisfying shelfie. Lowkey made my day I‚Äôm a nerd for organization Aaahh. Is there anything better than a clean, organized drawer? I'm saving this to my feed. Thank you. I recently switched from Cerave Hydrating Cleanser to the Vanicream Gentle cleanser due to Cerave being out at several stores near me. It actually works well for me and ended up being a good replacement. LOVE this! So pretty! May I also recommend the 500ML glow tonic, they release it occasionally but you save like $15 bucks buying the larger bottle! And it comes with a squirt top like a hand soap dispenser, which it so nice, because I usually just pour the bottle all over my cotton ball! This is so satisfying. I love the simplicity of your products and I use these as well. Once I went more simple my acne and irritation disappeared! That Clinique pep start is my favorite sunscreen ü•∞ Thank you for sharing! This also brings me joy, so satisfying to look at. This looks great! If you're looking for a new micellar water, I really love Bioderma's sensibio one. I should get some little baskets for mine. Yours looks so much better than mine lol. love it haha !! how is that glow tonic? i got a sample in the mail & wasn‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôd work with my skin Drawer goals! 

I wish to organise mine like yours. Most of our  products are common. Saved for inspiration and motivation!!! Today I went to cvs and saw the pixi brand. Someone can tell me how good it is? Deciem for the win! That‚Äôs the best deodorant in the world! I‚Äôm a man and I wear that stuff. Is the Pixi toner worth the buy??? üòçüòçüòç You got the coveted SA solution I see ü§®ü§® If it doesn‚Äôt fall and hit me in the head every time I open the cabinet then I don‚Äôt want it in my bathroom Sparks joy in me too! This too brings me joy. When i tell you i LITERALLY let out a small moan when i bumped into this- i love how simple this is! super organized and cute dropped bottles on their side üò¨ This is so pleasing to the eye. Thank you for sharing So clean and organize! I need this organization. My drawer is just chaos haha Love it I think I need one of these GOALS!!! Ok this has inspired me. I‚Äôve got to sort my shit top of bathroom drawer out and get up like this! is micellar water the same thing as thayers toner? Very nice! I really must get round to sorting out my jumble drawers. Organisation goals! I‚Äôve tried that deodorant. It smelled so good and actually cut back on my stinky sweat, but it gave me a rash! How do you like the rose tonic? I love the glow tonic and have been wanting to gift the rose to my mom It sparks joy for me too! I have a drawer, too! It‚Äôs not as nice and organized as yours, though. :) I‚Äôve seen the cotton balls(?) in the up right corner many times but I still wonder what is it for? I‚Äôm so stupid lol. Thank you!  I have rosacea as well on my chin and couldn‚Äôt figure out what products to use!! ü§© So orderly! Love it. Gives me great joy and it‚Äôs not even my drawer. Cute! I wish I had real drawers in bathroom Oooo I love this. So organized and aesthetically pleasing! I love Pixi! How‚Äôs their rose tonic? I‚Äôve just got their jasmine+retinol stuff and it‚Äôs been really really good so far Try the purito sunscreen. It‚Äôs the most lightweight one I‚Äôve found after a Long search. That looks awesome! I usually arrange it nice too but it lasts a week tooooops. How do you keep it tidy? What brand are those drawer organizers? So organized!!!  üòçüòç We have the same deodorant and it goes well with my rose-scented perfumes üòÑ Does TO Sayacilic Acid work well? Ok, but let's talk about that organization. That organization is just chef‚Äôs kiss üíã Would you recommend the pixie glow tonic ? Is it worth the hype ?? Ha! I wasn't sure if it was ScA or the Marie Kondo subreddit <3 Now I have goals. Beautiful! What's your opinion on The Ordinary? I haven't tried it yet. I've been using some Versed products though and love them! The organization üòçüòçüòç For the sun screen I would recommend the link below! It has a matte finish. My skin doesn‚Äôt get acne with it. It‚Äôs pricey but worth it!
[sunscreen ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AQNZ3WU/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_fab_40tBFbNSA28BD) My faveeee sunscreen is Etude House Sunprise something something. It is so light and wonderful and doesn't smell like sunscreen! I don't know if they have a tinted version but I would def check out Asian sunscreens. I try very hard not to use Amazon but I use it for that sunscreen and I buy like 3 bottles at a time! I would replace most of that with one thing. Tretinoin. If I just purchased the garnier water rose micellar water, and I haven‚Äôt used it yet. Is it any good or different than the regular micellar water? Has anyone had issues with The Ordinary moisturizer breaking them out? Omg WHERE are the black trays from?? A wave of peace washed over me Can you elaborate more about the "Ordinanry Products"? I've been thinking of buying them for some time now but don't know which one Beautifully organized Do you mind if I dm you? My mum has rosacea and its almost covering her entire face at the moment Orderliness GOALS! Perfection. That Pixi glow tonic definitely gives me joy! Oh man we use a ton of the same products and I‚Äôm wondering if I should try Pixi now! I love this but I must say it‚Äôs giving me leak anxiety Thanks for sharing! Glad that you've found a routine that works for you!

You said finacea foam is $300 for one tube??? Is it meant to be superior to the gel? Here in Australia the gel is about $25, maybe $30 bucks for a tube... Nice. Love it! Which ordinary products are your favorite? I definitely recommend TO's glycolic acid. I've used both it and the Pixi. It's cheaper, less fragranced (not sure if I can completely call it fragrance-free since there is rosewater) and more effective (slightly higher percentage of glycolic acid but also, more importantly, formulated at a lower pH which is essential for an AHA. The pH of the Pixi is too high IMO, but it does make it gentler). What about salicylic acid? Do you have any feedback on that? I don't see it in your routine but it's in the photo! I love the TO glycolic acid. Used to use the Pixie but the TO version is definitely an upgrade. 

I also use Paula's Choice Enriched Calming Toner and it's my jam. Very hydrating and calming. For the rose tonic replacement: I can think of two, depending on what you want out of it. If you want something more astringent, Thayers Rose Toner is great for that! If you‚Äôd like something more hydrating though, I highly recommend Secret Key Rose Toner. Is K-Beauty I believe, and is considered to be a cheaper alternative to SK-II. Whats the purpose of working out after you cleanse your face if you dont mind me asking? It seems counter productive so I'm interested Hi, where do you order the Vanicream cleanser from? Glad to hear you love the Vanicream cleanser! I bought it yesterday to start a skincare diet (boo, maskne). Here‚Äôs to no irritation! To your question about what you should replace the Pixi Rose Tonic with, have you tried a toner before? It is an extra moisturizing step. I have psoriasis on my face and am all about moisture. I like the Thayer's Rose Toner with my hyaluronic acid. Did you find that the azaelic acid dried you out at all? >Azelaic Acid-

Just bought this due to your post.  Cannot wait to see if it works on me! I also found the rose tonic doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything for my skin. I‚Äôm currently looking for a different toner lol For a everyday sunscreen I recommend the Elta MD facial sunscreen. I use the tinted version and it‚Äôs HG status! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú® I like the Heritage Store Rosewater toner. It‚Äôs really soothing and hyaluronic acid and aloe in it! Thank you for the reviews! The TO glycolic is 7% vs the Pixi's 5% so it would be really good for an increased effect. (I also think the TO is a slightly lower pH, but I'm not sure on that.)

I really want to try The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid... it's got the crosspolymer version of HA in which is my favourite variety.

Re Asian sunscreens - a lot of them aren't water resistant, which means they'll be less effective (as per American Academy of Dermatology recommendations). Some exceptions are Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Milk, the Missha Sun Milk range, and Kanebo Allie Extra UV Facial Gel. With sunscreens you want an SPF of at least 30, water resistance, and broad spectrum protection. :) If you like the Clinique sunscreen try the Krave Beauty one!!! Why do you make sure your face is damp with HA + B5? So aside from Azelaic acid you don‚Äôt use any other moisturizer on top? I have rosacea as well and I just bought some to try out! Lol! I can relate! I jumped on the konmari train last year and now only buy things I can store in a pleasing way....well except my kitchen. There's all sorts of trader joe's shit all over the place without any rhyme or reason, lol. Isn‚Äôt it though? And such a solidly detailed review too!! I actually have a serum from TO that *CANNOT* be laid down like that. Its bottle dropper i assume is defective because it will leak everywhere. So I was 100% thinking the same thing when I saw this, it made me totally anxious! Lol, honestly I've never even considered it! Also /r/konmari I am glad I‚Äôm not the only one, I saw this and I wish I could reach into the photo and move these things to a shelf üòÇ it is a satisfying fit, though! Aw man, I know that pain. üòì God speed my friend. Its ok. It smells and feels nice, but I still stink on hot days if I don't reapply. I typically use a natural deodorant in the in winter months and a traditional one in the summer months.  However, since it's covid times and no one but my fiance has to smell me, I've been sticking to this natural one. if you produce a lot of BO definitely don‚Äôt get it cause it would make me stink everyday I tried this one. It smells great, but it is not an antiperspirant. So once afternoon sweats hit, it smells like I didn‚Äôt put anything on. I went back to Degree üòî It smells so good but sadly doesn‚Äôt work well at all, even compared to the super natural/healthy ones I buy from Etsy. It's funny that you say that because I just ordered reusable bamboo pads a few days ago. The waste had been getting to me as well since I generally try to avoid waste wherever possible so I just googled "reusable cotton balls" the other day and was happy to see that there are some! They should be arriving next week and I'll make the switch. üòÅ I'm glad you said something though! Hopefully others will see this. I second this. I bought a pack of soft reusable wipes that I wash like once a week when I run out of clean ones. I use them to dry my face too so I‚Äôm not putting my hand/body  (shower) towel on my face every day. You can also crochet reusable ones that you throw in the wash :) I have a bag of them my sister in law made, you wash in the bag so they don't go missing Hmmm, I've been tempted to try the vitamin c, but I have no idea where to put it in my routine! Maybe something to look forward to after some researching/planning! Pixi helps all my acne problems tbh. I think its underrated too!! Do u use the vitamin c serum or cream? So what do you use to clean your ears? Do you pay for those hot candle things? Or do you have another tool?

Thanks to the replies. 
I have some googling to do! I found them in the office supplies section at Target. üò∏ Agree! I made the same switch a while ago on a whim but I like the vanicream way more Wuuut?! I am definitely going to keep an eye open for that! That‚Äôs my favourite sunscreen too and I‚Äôm so sad Sephora doesn‚Äôt seem to be carrying it anymore in Canada Yay! Thank you! Love this one! It‚Äôs what I use if I decide not to oil cleanse that day I love it!! I feel like it lives up to its name. My skin definitely looks glowy-er since I started using it! Been using the Pixi Glow Tonic for about 4 years now, I buy the largest bottle about twice a year. I love love love love it. My skin is noticably brighter and I hardly ever get break outs anymore (like maybe 4 times a year I get an annoying sucker that needs a spot treatment) I loooooooove Glow Tonic, and apparently so does a bunch of other women in my little city, because I have to get lucky for it to be stocked. My face is smoother and brighter. I did a change for a bottle of Biotherm Biosource toner but it didn't do quite as good a job. I also have Rose Tonic in a little sample bottle but I prefer Glow. I use one of their Lash Line Ink. It's a bit smudgy, but I don't mind as I use Velvet Cocoa colour and it bleeds into the base of my lashes nicely. I love it! Others here seem to be recommending TO glycolic acid, but as an intro to glycolic acid, I'm stoked. No. One acts as a cleanser, the other is a toner I don't think so, but I'm no expert. Really? I still stink, but I've got no rash lol I really like the way it smells and the way it feel going on! I'm not really sure if it does anything, but I think it'd be a nice gift! I use them for the micellar water. Yay! Thank you!! Usually over the course of a few months  things will start to pile up on the counter. Eventually when I deep clean the bathroom I always reorganize everything back in my drawer. Then I notice how nice it feels to keep everything organized, and that lasts for awhile. Then the whole cycle repeats. I think so! Have you tried the Versed sunscreen? I‚Äôve been eyeing it I like the ordinary a lot. You can't beat the price and my skin seems to really like these products. Yay! Thank you! Yay! Thank you! Hmm...May I ask why? I've seen that mentioned a lot on this sub recently. Prior to this I was using CeraVe's hydrating micellar water, which was my first one. I honestly don't notice much of a difference between the two. Im a sucker for rose things though so I guess I like this one better. Not for me but YMMV. I found them in the office supply section at Target a few years ago. üòä Im happy with the products I have here! At first I only purchased the AA and the NMF. I purchased AA as a sort of dupe for a prescription that was way out of my budget. I was happy with what it did for my skin. I liked the NMF as well so I kept repurchasing. Eventually I picked up the HA and Rosehip oil because I saw the (mostly) rave reviews here. 

The hardest part of the ordinary , IMO, is figuring out what you need. Perhaps surf this sub for someone who has similar skin to you and try one of the products they rave about. Then explore a little more from there. üòä I'm not sure I feel comfortable with that, sorry! I'm no doctor and my case has always been fairly mild. I don't have any understanding of how rosacea works or why AA worked for me. I just went with the flow. This sub has a mega rosaeca thread that may be more helpful. This was quite awhile ago so $300 is an estimate at this point. I just for sure remember it was crazy expensive. I also recall my derm saying he preferred the foam over the gel variety, but I never asked why! Now I'm curious lol. But yeah, I'm jealous of you guys in Australia. Definitely a tie between the hyaluronic acid and the rosehip oil! Oh my gosh! I forgot it!!! I only use it as a spot treatment for the occasional pimple on my face and body. Seems to work fine for that purpose! Ohhh I'm saving this! Thank you! Working out/Sweat opens up pores. If there is dirt or make-up, you don't want it to get in them,  it will make you break out. I found it at Target! I order mine from Amazon when I‚Äôm lazy but Walgreens might have it I used a toner in my proactive days along time ago. I added one in because I wanted something that makes me feel a little extra clean and a little extra moisturized. I had my eye on the thayers but ended up going with pixi. I've got a thing for rose stuff lol, so I'll give the thayers a try next time. Thank you! I did! I dropped down to using it every other night, and I always apply it over a nice hydrating moisturizer. Good luck! Awesome! Thank youuu! Ohh sounds lovely! Thank you! Oh thanks for that sunscreen tip! I'll keep that in mind. üòÅ Thank you!! I use TO Natural Mpisturizing Factors + HA as a moisturizer. I use it on its own in the AM and I mix in 1-2 drops of rosehip oil in the PM. 

I've read on this sub that some people use a moisturizer first, then apply azelaic acid. I've tried this, but prefer using AA then moisturizer however YMMV. Hope azelaic acid works for you! üòÅ Read this as ‚Äúwithout any thyme or reason‚Äù Didn‚Äôt read the view, far too mesmerised by the organised drawer I've had one spill, so i'm extra careful to close things before putting them back now üòÇ This has happened with every dropper bottle I‚Äôve ever gotten from TO. The cap somehow ends up wonky and won‚Äôt screw on correctly. Glad to hear I‚Äôm not the only one and just can‚Äôt figure out my caps. Lol, I guess this is a trigger for a lot of people! I've never even thought about it üòÇüòÇ The TO SA was recommended for my daughter for her acne and it‚Äôs nowhere to be found. Frustrating. You should try Schmidt‚Äôs! It smells amazing and I find that I actually does work. My favorite natural deo by far! Yes. I tried this same scent and it legitimately made my BO worse than if I hadn't worn any deodorant. I had the same issue with this and Schmidt‚Äôs. My absolute HG is now the tubs of deodorant cream from Little Seed Farm. They smell great too. I can go almost 3 days without starting to stink! I LOVE my bamboo ones! They're way softer than cotton balls and much larger. Enjoy! Could you link the ones you use please? üôè The Brightening Perfector! Sorry to but in here but they're called ear scoops! I get ear infections from everything, swimming pools, shampoos, clean air, ugh. But my doctor told me to use these [Clinere Ear Cleaners](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Clinere-Ear-Cleaners-Earwax-Removal-Kit-10-Ct/13430565?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&&adid=22222222227001220605&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=40754628992&wl4=pla-56973314825&wl5=9003552&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=13430565&veh=sem&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0bfr_9WC7AIVjbbICh1i2AdKEAQYBSABEgJ3HfD_BwE) or just google "ear scoops" for a bunch of brands My doctor told me to never put anything in my ears. They make wax for a reason and should be left alone. So I just listen to my doctor and try not to mess with my ears too much. Don't use those candle things they're not safe either, my Audiology professors would always say, DONT STICK ANYTHING IN YOUR EARS! They were very passionate about it so ita probably good advice üòÑ Your ears are generally self cleaning, no need to mess with them, DONT stick anything in your ears! If you happen to get enough wax buildup to compact, the recommended way to clear out excess or compacted wax is with a small dropper and squirt warm water or hydrogen peroxide and let it soak for a bit. Ear doctors may occasionally use a tool to remove a particularly bad case but that should only be done by a professional. Lol buying these now üòÇ Thank you so much for the info! ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you. Oh thank you for letting me know I haven't. I really like the HA Serum and the Brightening Serum and the caffeinated eye mask and their retinol. :) I'm mainly using ZO products right now but when I run out, I'm thinking about using all of Versed. Thanks! I know a lot of drugs are expensive in the US but somehow I just never thought about creams we use for our skin. Sorry I am quite uneducated/uninformed about this topic didnt mean to hijack your thread at all. Nice! Do you combine the hyaluronic one with anything or just use the serum alone usually? Do you just use the rosehip for extra hydration? What‚Äôs the added benefit for you? Thanks! I just purchased some of the items in your photo lol they looked so good and I think we pretty much have the same type of skin more or less! Fingers crossed Basically yeah. I do a swipe of micellar water before I work out because I use rosehip oil in my on routine and I just don't like the way it feels when sweat mixes with it. Can confirm. Got mine at Walgreens! Should I use Azelaic Acid AFTER the moisturizer or BEFORE the moisturizer? Cuz I‚Äôm using Azelaic acids before my moisturizer. And my moisturizer is kinda watery, and the azelaic acid is kinda thick. Or season lol Haha it only takes one spill to make you double check every time! I know TO is affordable, but I still feel terrible wasting product if I can help it It happened to me most recently with their rose hip seed oil. I was devastated bc everyone raves about it! I thought about going thru the trouble of returning it but I just ended up trashing it. I think its inability to close properly made it go rancid quit. Once I use up the rest of my TO products I think I‚Äôll be looking for higher quality alternatives :( I love Schmidt‚Äôs! I have to do the baking soda- free versions because otherwise I‚Äôll get a rash, but they‚Äôre long-lasting and smell great Ohh! Thanks for the recommendation. I'll give it a go when this one is empty!! üòÅüòÅ I've bought Schmidt's twice, both times the product was really ..gritty? It scratched my armpits. Thought I just had a bad batch the first time so bought again but.. nope  :(

Was it just bad luck? Why do horrible things happen to good people (wah!) same with the lavender scent for me Just ordered a free sample after reading your comment! Thank you! Thank you! I use it on its own. I find it spreads easily. It helps to seal in all my other products at night. I also realllllllllly like the way it feels going on. Plus it's supposed to help with acne scars and fine lines, both of which I feel have improved a bit since I started using it. For me, it's been a slow but steady journey. Good luck! I use it after my moisturizer, I find that it‚Äôs much easier to spread plus the moisturizer pre-AA gives my skin some fortification before hitting it with the drying stuff (I use CeraVe Moisturizing Cream on my AA nights) Yep. Forgot to screw the lid on my squalene oil one time and it went EVERYWHERE. I was scraping it up and slathering it on myself like a madman so as not to waste it, haha! Sameeee! Oh thank you! I‚Äôm gonna try that next time. All of the natural ones causes rash‚Äôs so far. No problem! They have a signature and sensitive formula (sensitive has no baking soda which can sometimes cause irritation). I use sensitive and never had any issues üòä Might‚Äôve been because you didn‚Äôt let it melt first. You‚Äôre supposed to allow it to warm up and soften a bit by holding it in your armpit for like 15 seconds and then it won‚Äôt be as scratchy Did you use the formula with or without baking soda? Baking soda tends to be grainy but the sensitive one doesn‚Äôt have any and is super smooth. Also agree with the other commenter, natural deo needs to warm up on your skin for a few seconds (I do like 3-5 seconds) Same! Wait, did I miss something? What's with the skincare fridges i've been seeing on here? How do we know which products are best kept chilled? Thanks in advance  Is that rose quartz roller any good? 

I keep going to buy it and then not going through with it in case it‚Äôs just a fad.  I‚Äôve been thinking about getting a skincare fridge for a while now but never really had any extra money to, so it was really nice of him to get me one! 

The brand is called Cooluli and he got it off of Amazon. It‚Äôs so cute (and pink) and stores a good amount of products. 

So far my favorite has been using a nice and cold rose quartz roller under my eyes first thing in the morning to reduce the puffiness I get.

Does anyone have any idea about products that should NOT go in the fridge? I enjoy applying my moisturizer when it is cool, or even my bioderma sensibio. But I do have some concern that maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be and haven‚Äôt seen any posts on this before!  I have this same freezer but for ice cream haha I want one of these so badly! I'm curious if it prolongs the shelf life of products as well. this is SUCH a good idea and exactly the thing i do not need but 100% must purchase immediately!!!!! [deleted] That's really sweet. I have considered getting one. What are your thoughts on the Clean it Zero balm? I kind of want to try it but I am leery because it has fragrance in it.  Does the mini fridge make any noise? I've been nervous about keeping one in my bedroom. Thanks! Why is it that the color scheme of your skincare products impress me so much? Like I feel like you‚Äôve got perfect skin just by looking at those rose tones. I saw it and was literally jealous of my assumption that you‚Äôve got it all together. I feel flexed on for no reason.  Love that lotus sheet mask! One of my favourites  These are a thing?? Where did he get it?? How exactly do these skincare fridges enhance your products or routine? Would love to know your thoughts on the pond‚Äôs clarant B3! Want to buy but I‚Äôm not sure if I can trust that it will have any real effect on dark spots/scarring What does that tea tree water pray do Usually I think these are silly but oh my Lord it's so cute  So what‚Äôs the temperature inside the fridge? Like refrigerator temp? (4 degrees celcius here) or warmer? Omg! I have that fridge from when I was breastfeeding/pumping and I was considering donating it now that my kid's weened but this is SUCH a better idea!!!! Thank you! Everything matches so well. When I grow up I want to be you. Do you have the products/reviews listed somewhere? This is aesthetically pleasing I‚Äôve never heard of a skincare fridge before, what are they useful for? Wow, what a wasteful extra use of energy. As if our food fridges don't contribute enough.  I can only imagine how awesome this will be during a hot summers day and you want some refreshing skincare!! What exactly is the reasoning behind a skincare fridge outside of storage convenience? This is amazing! I can imagine how nice the masks especially must feel when they‚Äôre cool ! Thanks for sharing!

I was wondering, what's that tea tree water like? I've been using straight TTO on any bad blemishes I've had but I know it's supposed to be diluted. This water sounds like a perfect solution for lazy me but I wanted to hear your thoughts on it and how you're using it. That's brave, I hate putting stuff on my face in the morning when it's all reached my overnight room temperature, 17C.  I always hesitate with that pad full of chilly toner, bracing myself for coldness. I thought about getting one but I have way too many skincare products. Marry him.  Gurl this is amazing üò≥üò≥üò≥ I need one of those ASAP  Hmm wish my bf sees this... Do products need to be kept in a fridge?? Don't think I've purchased anything that wasn't off an unrefrigerated shelf...and they definitely don't store in warehouses or ship refrigerated...! Are you supposed to keep jade rollers in the fridge? How do you know which products should be refrigerated?  I really want one of these but my stupid master bathroom only has one outlet even though there‚Äôs two sinks üòí You're the only other person I've seen who also uses Ponds clarant. Have you noticed any visible changes or improvements with it? I'm a little puffer fish when I wake up in the morning, so I'd probably enjoy this for cold rollers and face masks and creams. But I'd probably move it to my room and store chocolate instead, since I live in melting hell territory.  Aaahhh I‚Äôve had my eye on these!!! Lucky! Fridge: Dont hate me because Im just a lil cooler.. Crap now I really want one of these ! So cute ! How cold do these go? Do they go as cold as regular fridges? Are normal refrigerators not good enough??? Hey OP I bought that same ponds cream recently and have used it for around two weeks now. I have extremely fair skin and trying to get rid of hyperpigmentation. Do you feel this helps at all for that? or just dark marks/darker skin what is the lotus face mask for? and where did you buy it?? This is adorable! I DEFinitely need the mini refrig for vitamin C serum and packs!!! He is a keeper. ladies, if ur bf buys u a skincare fridge, hes a keeper. Wow it looks awesome! That is so thoughtful!! Omg. Marry him. This is lovely, I have always wanted one of this. i miss having a lush store near me so much  What a boyfriend!!!! I keep my rose quartz roller in my food fridge next to the pickles and my husband thinks I‚Äôm ridiculous. This is adorable and I love it!!!! I want one  This is so cute and aesthetically pleasing. i need it omg! And it's pink!!! üòç *throws money to the screen* üòÇ Ugh, this damn thing is so stinking cute! I love the baby pink and white aesthetic too lol 
 this is a great present, I‚Äôve seen one in pink that‚Äôs been really popular on Instagram lately  Okay that is super sweet! I also think its just awesome that all your skincare products match up!  Love it! I have the same one! But I took out the divider so I can put more stuff in it!  Any other stuff you use by ponds?? I am loving my ponds hydrating face cream right now. So much better than expansive crap!!! It‚Äôs so....pink! I didnt know this was a thing, but thats awesome!  So sweet! That's a useful and uncommon type of gift! 5 stars for him! I'm so jealous!!! I'm looking in to getting one for myself when I have the money. Does it really make it that much of a difference? Omg, I'm so jelly. It's so freaking cute I have to get one üòçüòçüòç my bf made fun of me soo hard when i told him this was a thing and that i wanted one lol congratulations on the keeper Literally just decided to buy one after seeing this picture because I am a weak ass skincare hoe. Thanks for posting!! It‚Äôs super cute!! Ah that's awesome! How well does the rose quartz facial roller work? I've been eyeing it on Amazon but not sure  You found a heckin keeper. He‚Äôs a keeper  Omg I didn't know this was a thing!!?? Ok now that is the sweetest and cutest gift of them all Oh my ghaaaddddd I‚Äôve been wanting that forever Aww this is so cute. I‚Äôd love a skin care mini fridge.  So nice of him!! When I told my hubby I wanted one a while ago, he said I was crazy hahaha Oh fuck is tea tree water suppose to go in the fridge?! Damn Can I put beverages in it? he‚Äôs a keeper !!!!  You have the best boif! üëèüëè It's perfect!  ugh goals  best boyfriend ever  He's a keeper! Marry him Marry him He's a keeper ! Marry him! Quick! I dream of having one of these on my vanity in my future home üíò I have this exact same one! I really really wish I got the bigger size :( Accumulated too many skincare products recently. Struggles. [deleted] WoW!  Marry him!!! Omg spoiled! Lucky girl! üòç Schwing It's kinda nice but you realllly don't need one. It's the bandwagon effect in marketing. The only product that needs refrigeration is vitc (acid form) and anything that explicitly states to put it in a fridge. If budgeting better was your new years resolution--seriously, don't get it. I know vitamin c is best kept in the fridge but idk about anything else needing it. It's just that cold serums and stuff feels nicer and can reduces redness/puffiness Cute little fridge too, I want one but idk why haha There are actually a few products other than Vitamin C that can benefit from refrigeration, like delicate oils/oils with short shelf-lives (like borage), products without preservatives or inadequate preservative systems, and some DIY skincare products.

Also, the coldness of products can be beneficial for some. My rosacea, for example, tends to respond better to products (when it comes to reducing redness and irritation) when they're cold than room-temp.

Other than that, though, it's just convenience and/or preference. I have two (yeah, I know) and I keep about half of my skincare products in it, from DIY concoctions and oil blends to delicate oils to the products without preservatives (like my Manyo Factory products and decanted Elizavecca extracts) to retinoids to water-based Vitamin C.  Most products don‚Äôt but if you make your own skin care stuff it‚Äôs convenient. There are a few high end products that recommend refrigeration but you will know if you get it. I can also see  cold press oils and vitamin c having better effects refrigerated. I‚Äôve loved using mine so far! I can‚Äôt say there has been any drastic results other than when I first wake up and my face is its puffiest. To me it‚Äôs more of a luxury product than a necessity!  I enjoy using it while having on a sheet mask, to press in the serum  it's 100% a fad, but that doesn't mean you don't deserve it if it fits your budget and makes you happy. 

MOST things are a fad to be frank. Anything that helps you enjoy your routine is beneficial in helping you keep your routine. anything that makes you happy is legit in its happifying ability.  I have one too but I rarely use it. I like using it when I sheet mask, though, to roll the essence/cream, etc around. I personally think I'll use it more when it's summer because the coolness will feel so nice.

&#x200B;

It's also nice to put around your sleepy eyes in the morning. Just feels great. But other than that, if I hadn't bought it, I wouldn't say I'm missing out on anything. There‚Äôs no magic inherent to rocks, so the ‚ÄúThe stone can alter your vibration‚Äù or whatever that some people claim is garbage. But, massage has been used for years to reduce swelling, puffiness, and fluid retention in the face (and elsewhere); rollers just help one maintain even pressure and cover larger amounts of surface area at once. Also, coldness can be beneficial in some situations (my rosacea responds more significantly to products when they‚Äôre cold, for example). 

Fun fact: jade is often used for rollers because jade gets and stays cooler longer than other stones. The ‚Äújade‚Äù roller going for $4 on eBay is not real jade, of course, but even cheap rollers usually stay cold long enough for normal use (like my $8 ‚Äújade‚Äù roller from TJ Maxx).  I have a jade one. From FFF, I dunno about results or anything "scientific " but when I have a rough day at work, I pull it out of the freezer and massage my temples and jawline...it helps. It relieves stress, for me anyways. Also I like applying my serum or cream  with it because I feel like it's not wasted by being absorbed by my hands.  I have that same one! It's great, it's nicely weighted and very relaxing after a long day.  It almost definitely is. I‚Äôd like to see some peer reviews studies backing that up, it definitely sounds like bs.  I saw kail had a green one and it made me want one lol 

(Recognize ur username from teen mom) they sell them at tjmaxx for less than $10 in Texas Lol I just metal spoons. I put spoons in the freezer and use then for my eyes and cheeks. I take the back of the spoon and rub it against my face. For those interested: don't buy it off of Urban Outfitters! They have this on there and the pictures advertising the product looks cool... But it's the same thing as the one on Amazon! Amazon sells it cheaper.

I also have this! I love it. I also keep a can of la croix in there üòÇ Can I ask what the fridge is for?  Longer shelf time of products or to keep them cold or?  so tempted to buy the cow print one!  Ooooo and sheet masks would feel amazing in the summer.  I use this fridge to store my breast milk under my desk at work!!! It‚Äôs a great fridge. When I‚Äôm done breastfeeding I‚Äôm gonna bring it home and use it for skincare...such a good idea!!! I looked at a few mini fridges but they all seemed to make a lot of noise when running. Is this one quiet? >rose quartz roller

Where did you get yours from? I see Ulta carries one, but the gold on theirs looks less yellow than yours. Just curious if it was the same one. I ordered a few jade rollers from eBay several years ago, but they were some really shitty quality ones from China. I think they've gotten more popular since then and are more readily available, so I'm just looking for somewhere to get a good quality one. I'm really liking the pink!

Edit: Just saw another comment where you said you ordered it on Amazon. Would you mind sharing which one you got? Does the Rose Quartz roller have any effects on your face? I thought about getting one but I wasn't sure if rolling something on my face would be effective or not lol Adorable! I want one!!  I've never felt a stronger connection with a stranger than  right now Doesn't it seem weird that you put your toiletries in the same fridge you eat out of? I mean they're sharing the same airspace as my leftover lasagna! I know it seems like I'm a skincare elitist to have my own fridge, but we gotta protect those pores!!!  I only heard to not store oil based products in the fridge or else the oil and water ingredients can separate. 
If nothing has happened to the texture of your moisturizer then it doesn‚Äôt hurt to keep it cool!  It actually keeps it from melting? I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from these little fridges! It does! Especially if you use products with fresh ingredients in them (like Lush face masks for example). Also this would be useful if you have any Vitamin C, retinol, or benzoyl peroxide products that generally shouldn‚Äôt be kept in warm environments  can you provide the link? every cheap fridge i find on ali express is like $12 but then they want $15-30 for shipping I would say it does a pretty good job of melting off my makeup (all except waterproof mascara that I have to use micellar water for).

The scent isn‚Äôt strong at all but if your skin is sensitive to products with fragrance then I probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase it  I was actually really nervous about that because I‚Äôm the type of person who needs complete silence to be able to fall asleep and I honestly don‚Äôt really notice the sound of it. It‚Äôs quieter than a white-noise machine and just sounds like a little hum!  I have one that's super loud. I let it run during the night and turn it off in the morning when I do my makeup. Same tho  It‚Äôs so colour coordinated!  Amazon! It‚Äôs called the Cooluli Mini Fridge  Honestly I have something that looks identical to this but is just called a hello kitty ‚Äòmini drink frig‚Äô or something like that. It was a gift but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was like $20ish at target. ‚ÄòCan fit 4 cans!‚Äô Lol it has to be plugged in at all times though & makes a pretty quiet but still kind of annoying noise from the fan or whatever it is keeping it cool in there. Just not really worth the hassle imo. It‚Äôs back in the box for now..  So far I‚Äôve found it motivates me to care for my skin more because of how nice and cooling all of my products feel now. 

I used to be really lazy in taking off my makeup before I went to sleep and now that I have a nice and cool cleansing balm in the fridge- it makes me more excited to get up and do it. 

Plus moisturizing or using a cool face mask feels really refreshing - almost like a spa treatment everyday.

I wouldn‚Äôt say that I needed the fridge at all, but having it has definitely made me eager to keep up my routine!  I‚Äôve always used the regular Ponds face cream to upgrading to the Clarant B3 let me see if there was an actual difference, and it wasn‚Äôt that extreme. I‚Äôd say it cleared up very minimal scarring I had from old acne but the rest of my skin is still relatively the same. 

I think I‚Äôm just going to use up the rest of it and then scout for a different correcting cream.  I've had some minimal success with it as well for a small sunspot, the only real downfall is the overwhelming fragrance. It's reaaaaally perfume-y.  I use it as a toner after I‚Äôm done cleansing!  Fridge temp. I have the same Cooluli model at my desk at work to keep my Diet Cokes cold and away from thieves. They stay very cold. It probably takes longer to cool them down from room temp than a regular fridge would, but once they're cold, they stay cold. 

I have a thermometer at my desk too, so I'll pop it in the tiny fridge today and see what it says. I was planning on posting something separately after I gave all these products a fair shot since I haven‚Äôt had them for that long yet!  i was about to say lol. loving all the pink products! Refrigerating products that last longer refrigeration, like Vit C, or are more pleasant with refrigeration, like sheet masks. 

They are not essential, as you could buy a drink fridge for a much lower price, or just put your products in a drawer or shoebox in your kitchen fridge. [deleted] I‚Äôve been using the tea tree water for about a year (on and off) and I actually really enjoy it! After I finish cleansing my face I‚Äôll spray it a few times on my skin and it serves as an excellent pick me up when it‚Äôs cold. 


It keeps my pores small and just overall keeps my skin feeling cleaner, softer, and less irritated. I don‚Äôt know exactly if it‚Äôll help with bad blemishes because I use different products for those- but the tea tree water has overall made my skin much easier to care for!
 fucking stop with this shit Keeping it in the fridge boosts the de-puffing power because the coolness reduces the swelling! I haven't had any issues keeping mine in the freezer.  most people refrigerate products like moisturizers and face masks just for the cooling sensation when applying. Some products that degrade or need to be kept at certain temperatures like retinol/vitamin C/products with no preservatives should be refrigerated. On average it's not necessary, just an additional luxury. I know one that goes to around 40 degrees (maybe a little lower I forgot lol)

it's here though if you wanna check it out https://mtnlightco.com/fridge I‚Äôve used it for about half a year and I found that it helped me with some redness and acne scarring!  Jeez why did that get downvoted  [deleted] Same. He said ‚Äúmaybe someday.‚Äù Hmmm So buy it for yourself!  On the Lush bottle it said ‚ÄúKeep your toner in the fridge for an extra refreshing spritz‚Äù so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal if it‚Äôs not in the fridge, it just feels nicer cold!  he really doesn't Thanks, that makes sense. Def not getting one though, starting Accutane on monday, wish me lucküòì  Yeah I keep my vitc in my beer fridge in my room...no way would I buy a seperate mini for that lol So would Ascorbic Acid need to be refrigerated?  i kept my vitamin c in a regular cabinet but i would love to put some sheet mask there. am i weird? hahaha Cause it's a cute lil' fridge Thank you!! 

I keep looking at it and I‚Äôm a sucker for rose quartz anyway. I might treat myself.  Where did you purchase your roller?  Oh, now that‚Äôs a shout. 
I might do that tomorrow while I have a pamper night.  A cold roller on top of a sheet mask is like, EXTREME bliss/relaxation/treat yo self ü§©üòå Great idea! I‚Äôm a nightmare. I‚Äôll start something with every intention of being religious and then it ends up in a drawer. 

I think I‚Äôm just going to go for it. Probably won‚Äôt use it daily, but I think for a pamper night and all that, I‚Äôd use it. Everyone‚Äôs been quite positive about it so far. 

Like you said, it‚Äôs not breaking the bank for one, so if I lose interest, it‚Äôs not an expensive thing.  I got mine for headaches and stress relief mainly (but mine is jade). The coldness of the stone provides some temporary relief for me, it's the same concept as cold stone massage. But it's not a miracle cure or anything crazy Yeah. I get that. I know what I‚Äôm like - I‚Äôll use it a few times and then probably forget about it. 

I‚Äôm a fickle cow to be honest. 

 I didn't even know stone rollers were a thing. High school me would just chuck a metal spoon in the freezer for a minute (the back of a cool spoon helps reduce eye puffiness from allergies).  

Kids these days are so fancy :) Yeah. It was o my for the puffiness - I think it‚Äôs ¬£15 for the one I was looking at and just wondered if it was a bit of a useless trend. 

I might actually give this one a go though, thank you for the info. Really appreciated.  Any HG products you would recommend for Rosacea? I also like to use it for putting my oils on watching getting it on my hands. It's so surreal seeing this comment because I'm a practicing polytheist and occult shit is part of my life. A lot of "New Age" folks LOVE using crystals for "magical" purposes such as "curing" depression or other illness. Or the vibration stuff. It's all a load of shit. They're like... the "anti-vaxxers" of occult spirituality. It's fucking weird. I‚Äôm really liking these ideas, I‚Äôm thinking I may just go for it and buy one. 

Do you keep it in the fridge constantly?  I‚Äôm so sold on this now. 

I‚Äôve added it to my LOOOOOOOOONG collection of skin and hair stuff I decided to splurge on, on payday.  Heyyyyyyyy, fellow TMer! 

Thank goodness you didn‚Äôt say jenelle. üòê I‚Äôm in the UK. 

I found one on amazon for ¬£15, so I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm going to go for it and get one. 

Not breaking the bank if I don‚Äôt get on with it.  Aka everything at UO. All the same Chinese crap with prettier packaging / pictures.  [deleted] Unless you work for urban outfitters and get 40% off :D  Totally OT but I hear so many people talking about LaCroix lately. Does it have any flavour? Is it just like carbonated water w ‚Äúessence‚Äù and almost zero flavour like Zevia and bubly? I‚Äôm thinking it must be good for so many people to rave about it, but OTOH I‚Äôm so expecting it to have sucker water level flavour What could you possibly use breastmilk for? How is it good for skin? 

Oh. Wait. 

NM.   Not the OP but I have this in my lab, and it's super quiet; it's easy to forget it's there! The really tiny ones like this are basically silent. They don't use compressors to cook like a big refrigerator so there's not much to make noise.  I have the mini fridgidare version in pink and it‚Äôs quiet, adorable (cuter than OP‚Äôs) cheaper and keeps beverages or whatever hella cold.  I seriously love it. My real fridge is all the way downstairs- this mini fridge has improved my quality of life lol.  I got a roller from Walmart! I went to Ulta and UO and saw they were tripled the price then the one I got from Walmart, crazy. I think it works pretty good, the only difference is the more expensive one has bumps or massagers on one of the rollers This one! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BRPR6JD/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_i_7m2BCbCZGTYH9 TJ Maxx has a bunch of jade and rose quartz ones! The one I bought was Cheaper than amazon. Kindred cheese & skincare spirits!  Uh, no?? All of my sheet masks are in sealed packages. It‚Äôs not like I unwrap them and put them in a Tupperware with some leftover chili.  Is there any benefit to getting this versus just putting those products in your regular fridge though? Just ultimate convenience? Now I know what I'm adding to my birthday wishlist... There is a specific Clean It Zero that‚Äôs made for sensitive skin (purple in the new packaging, light blue in the old) Did you find the balm itself kind of hard to wash off? & Do you follow it with a second cleanser? Whenever I use it I feel like I have to scrub my face off with a second cleanser to feel like it's gone :/ Awesome, thanks! It's so cute and amazing! If only for aesthetic purposes! My local Target has something similar for [$39.99](https://www.target.com/p/chefman-portable-personal-fridge-black/-/A-53431777?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&CPNG=PLA_Appliances%2BShopping_Local&adgroup=SC_Appliances_Toasters&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=m&location=9015321&gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1247068&ds_rl=1246978&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzdW3tdnN4AIVQRh9Ch2ByAcxEAQYBiABEgI1nfD_BwE).

 Awesome thank you Ah yeah I‚Äôve noticed that with just the regular pond‚Äôs moisturiser, that‚Äôs a shame Ya but what does a toner actually do? I never used one  Idk why the mods are allowing this. You‚Äôre supposed to at least list the products in your shelfie  Why is being a hoarder something to brag about no offense  stop buying things [deleted] Well that's a hell of an endorsement! üòâ
But seriously, that's awesome that you've had such luck with it. Good to know it's helping to tighten your pores. I like that it's handsfree, too. 

Thanks for the info! awesome thanks! idk lol guess lush is a nono?  If shes into skincare i have no doubt that she would love itüòÇ maybe get her a bunch of sheet masks to keep in it? As far as other skincare products go, i would look at the stuff she uses a lot and get her extras of those. Good luck!!! It‚Äôs totally worth the disgusting dry lips!!! After watching the dramatic change it had on Thataylaa on YouTube, who dealt with cystic acne, I‚Äôm soo excited for you! Her skin is so gorgeous now üíï Good luck I hope you get the results you want. <3 So worth it! Good luck.. and if you do want to keep something chilled, a regular refrigerator works just fine too :) I hate to be negative but please, please be careful with Accutane. I know you will have read all about the side effects but please really consider them. My partner was on it for 2 years and it ruined his sex drive, his eyes were all ulcerated and dry, his skin became flakey and painful, he still has very swollen and painful joints and can no longer play football, his digestive system has been greatly affected, it can cause colitis, impotence, severe depression, and a whole host of other things. He never would have started on it if he had known how awful things were going to get, he would much rather lived with severe cystic acne (all over back, neck and face)  rather than have to have gone through all of this. I just hate hearing about people who are about to start it, you might be okay and I really hate to rain on your parade but feel I would be being irresponsible without spreading the warning.  Be careful honey, make sure you know that this is what you want. Accutane is a great drug for acne.  Make sure to not eat carrots while on it though.  I ate 3 kg a week without realizing it contained vitamin a.  My grandma brought it up with my derm and I've never seen a doctor look at me with so much fear Good luck!  I know it's got a scary rep, but it changed my life!!  I went from uncontrollable breakouts, painful acne, oily skin to perfect skin in about a month!  Just keep a lookout for depression symptoms and for goodness sake don't get pregnant! Word of hopeful advice... I took that in high school. It definitely gets worse before it gets better. And when it gets better it‚Äôs REALLY better. But hang in there, the effects are definitely long lasting. I wish you all the best!  Good luck girl!! I‚Äôve heard so many great things about accurate!  Aquaphor will be your best friend ‚ù§Ô∏è Good luck! I used it in high school.. my skin was so bad I had to do 3 cycles. My face was like a giant dry flake and that was with moisturizer every day. As others have said tho, it really gets better. Carry moisturizer and chap stick all the time! I also have no scarring which is pretty nice.. idk if that‚Äôs accutane or genetics tho.  Youll be fine! Dont worry! Follow your physicians advice and you'll be good. I'm so happy I did it. The results were permanent for me. So worth it! I have a condiments and face masks shelf in my full size fridge because it's just nice to put on a chilled mask after a long day. I happened to find 6 of these on clearance at Walmart for $5/each the first time someone posted one here. Guess who now owns 6 mini fridges for no apparent reason.  I bought one from Walmart lol. Since it's only use is being cold and massaging, it works. Amazon!  Do it. I watch a lot of tv. Multitasking!  Sure! With the caveat that rosacea varies *widely* and what works for me might prove problematic for you (especially since my skin -- even the rosacea-affected seas -- is not sensitive overall): centella asiatica, licorice root, propolis, and snail mucin have been game-changers for me. In each category, my HGs are:

* Centella asiatica: A'pieu Madecassoside fluid *(contains essential oils, which can be an issue for many; I have cica gel and cream en route but haven't tried them yet)*, Skin1004 Madagasgar Centella Asiatica 100 Ampoule, and CA extract self-diluted to skin-safe levels *(bought from Making Cosmetics but will likely use Lotioncrafter in the future)*.

* Licorice root: Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner, LR extract self-diluted to skin-safe levels *(bought from Making Cosmetics but will likely use Lotioncrafter in the future)*.

* Propolis: Scinic Honey All-in-One Ampoule (discontinued, sadly), Pure Heals Propolis 90 Sleeping Pack

* Snail mucin: COSRX Snail 96 Power Essence, COSRX Snail 92 All-in-One Cream, Mizon Black Snail All-in-One Cream I do. I rinse after applying product. Put it back in the box it came in and keep it in the freezer. No issues so far, I've had it for about 5 months. I found mine in a local crystal shop, but I'm betting Wish or Amazon will have them too! Yeah her face ain‚Äôt puffy like kails, the jade roller probably does her wonders hehe üòú  Not OP, but I found it on Amazon.

[Cooluli Mini Fridge Electric Cooler and Warmer (4 Liter / 6 Can): AC/DC Portable Thermoelectric System w/ Exclusive On the Go USB Power Bank Option] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7IL476/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_GyXBCbTNY6T5Q) It tastes like what you said, carbonated water with "essence" basically. I'm not gonna lie (why would I, I don't do sponsorships üòÇ) but it's not that great, but the more you drink it, you grow accustomed to the taste. It's a decent alternative to soda, cause I love coke, but I know it's not good for me, but I need something that'll give me that carbonated kick.  It‚Äôs pretty much identical to Bubly‚ÄîI feel like bubly actually has stronger flavor for many of their flavors lol. I‚Äôm from the Midwest so I grew up with LaCroix and I love it but I would say Polar has the best seltzer overall.  Thanks for the suggestion! How does the quality of yours seem? The ones I received were pretty shabby. The metal part that holds onto the rollers was really weak and the rollers came off of one and the entire thing (metal + rollers) came off the other. -_- Thanks! Cool, someone else suggested Walmart and both of those stores a couple minutes away from each other. I'll check them out. How durable does your seem? Thanks for the suggestion! I was being satirical. ;)  Yeah, I think it's more for convenience. It can be a bit hectic having skincare products mixed in with your groceries in the fridge lol. It's just a preference. After all, I keep my vitamin c stuff in my normal fridge. The rest stays in the cupboard in my bathroom. I see no need for a separate fridge, but it sure does look cute! I kind of just use it as a makeup remover so after I rub it on and wash it off I follow up with my regular cleanser!  And OPs I‚Äôm sure is nicer & may not have these issues at all, was just commenting my personal experience.  It closes up pores on the face and can be slightly soothing. Some can also be slightly cleansing like the tea tree one she has. Sorry about that, I just listed them out in a comment above (:  [deleted] [deleted] Ty:) after years of cystic acne, it sounds worthwhile  Woah. I hadn‚Äôt seen her videos in so long and went to go look. No scaring or anything just looks spotless, even, and so healthy. What is this?!? Ty!:) it is terrifying that a doctor allowed someone to be on accutane for two years. my doctor would absolutely not allow it past nine months because of how much it can raise triglycerides, the damage it can cause your liver, etc. it is worth raising a red flag with such a horrible experience, but being on accutane for two years is ridiculous and unsafe, that doctor was ludicrous. That‚Äôs a lot of carrots! Why shouldn‚Äôt one eat carrots while on Accutane? Can I buy one from you? Seriously lol How much do they cost normally ? Can I buy one too ?  My sister is kind of obsessed with getting one of these, if you‚Äôre still possibly selling? I will gladly buy one from your and paying for the shipping if you still have any left.  Also interested if you're still selling! amazing Oh a giveaway would be fun! I have a cheap one I found at Marshalls, but the first time I used it I noticed these little white flakes falling off. I thought it was the oil I was using pilling, but inside the jade area was flaking. So I haven't used it since lol  WHAT. The Scinic Honey AIO was discontinued?? It's my HG product, I'm so sad.  Oooo thank you so much for the detailed response!! I'm seeing a dermatologist next month and will ask about these products! I appreciate you üòä  I have thought about buying the Acwell licorice toner since I think the witch hazel toner I use may be aggravating my redness. Do you just spray it on your face or apply with cotton pad? Oh the freezer and not the fridge. Brilliant. Thank you. 

I suppose rinsing it after each use makes sense as well - I clean my makeup brushes daily, so that‚Äôs kinda the same thing.  I saw it on amazon - I was looking for something (as usual) and found it... had a look, kept putting it in my basket, taking it out, so on. 

It‚Äôs in and it‚Äôs staying. Roll on payday on the 25th!  Haaaaaa!! I thought it was the slanty shack damp air.  I love how it's advertised with this macho plaid wearing, truck driving dude using it to keep his beer cold, and we're sticking Beauty products in it lol.  Am I the only one who wants the cow print?  Yuuuus cow colour  Omg yes it ships to Australia! I bought one off eBay (from China) and as soon as I plugged it in it sparked and caused a power outage in my house!  50 bucks CAD max you should be paying for these kinda things. On that note, anyone get the [bluetooth speaker version](https://www.amazon.ca/Gourmia-GMF668-Thermoelectric-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B07JFQC2BZ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=mini+fridge&qid=1550797604&s=kitchen&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1) and does it sound slightly better than crap? I have one at my desk at work just for my cans of diet soda and string cheese and I love it.  It works really well and keeps things colder than I expected. I‚Äôm kind of surprised you guys have heard of Bubly , I had thought it was a local grocery stores take on LaCroix I just bought one from Colourpop and it seems reasonably sturdy.  Oh, damn. Sorry! I woke up late and haven‚Äôt had my coffee this morning and my humor detection sensor is way off. I was like, damn this b is really throwing me some shade...  Oh okay!! I‚Äôve used witch hazel b4 and I didn‚Äôt notice anything lol Sounds wasteful and extravagant to me. Sorry I don't want to attack you but it just seems like buying products for the sake of buying shiny new things  [deleted] Have you tried cetaphil? Might be a dumb question but it‚Äôs helped 3 of my gfs who suffered cystic acne and tried every major acne clearing system out there  Yeah she had bad cystic acne and she went on Accutane and it worked amazingly for her..  I like carrots  Accutane is a retinoid, which means it is related to vitamin a.  Retinoids are difficult for the liver to process, so too much can cause liver damage.  Feel free to eat some carrots, but be mindful of the amount.  I'd ask your derm how much is too much though PM me your zip code and I'll see what it would cost to ship.  Oooooo gross lol. I haven't had an issue with mine, but its a "rose quartz" one. Yeah, it, the Snail, and the Aqua started disappearing from retailers a few months ago, but [someone got confirmation from Jolse a couple days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/artryd/daily_deals_fluff_and_hauls/egpuvyo/). There are a few places left to find it (Hautelook, eBay, etc), so if you want to stave off losing it, get it while you can! :( I usually just apply it with my hands, actually! I tend to decant things into 1oz bottles (spray, pump, or dropper), so I use 1-2 drops (I mix it with the DIY extract and just cover my rosacea-affected areas) and apply from a measuring spoon with one finger, then pat in with a silicone applicator ([something like this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91eqJ76GIXL._SY355_.jpg)). Many do use it with cotton pads/rounds but I found myself wasting more product than necessary that way, but it would be more convenient! If you click the black color, it shows it filled with skin care products üòÇ funny because you would think the light blue one would be the more "feminine" one lol

Edit: the red and black one both show skin care products in them lol No way! Cows are my favorite animal (no, I cannot explain this, I just think they're stupid cute) and I literally only looked this up because someone else mentioned the cow pattern and I had to know what it looked like!  Nah Bubly is the Pepsi brand sparkling water. I think it first came out in early 2018 but it‚Äôs pretty widespread by now.  Or my sense of humour is so warped from doing overnight shifts that I'm the one who is loopy...
Lol

SCA poreless princesses be like "how dare you put your masks with the cheese!!!! The nerve!!!!" 



 [deleted] Accutane is a last resort medication for people with acne who have literally tried everything. It‚Äôs hardcore, like blood tests every month while you‚Äôre on it hardcore. The lotion or the face wash? I currently use CeraVe. Thanks.... I was just curious that‚Äôs all.  Thanks so much for the info! I just stocked up on 2 jars. I guess I'll have to start looking for similar products :( Oh my god the silicone applicator is a great idea! I got one as a gift and had no idea what to do with it. Thank you!! Oh I didn't even see that haha. Oddly enough I've never heard of beauty products being kept in a fridge, but the idea sounds interesting.  Honestly I am just impressed that I remember to put them in the fridge at all. And I only started doing it because I buy my sheet masks from a Korean grocery store, and one time when my SO was unloading groceries, he just put it away in there without paying attention to what it was. The cold sheet mask felt SO GOOD on my skin that I keep them there now. Next to my cheese. Super convenient for particularly tough days.  Am I wrong for offering a suggestion I‚Äôve heard from 3 separate women was what worked for them? I‚Äôm not telling them to not use Accutane, simply offering a suggestion. Thanks for the information. Sounds like this person hasn‚Äôt tried cetaphil. The face wash  Happy to help mate how much did u pay for it? honestly, yes Wow someone really downvoted this? Anyway thanks I‚Äôll try it... I got two jars for around $14 each Fuck me for trying right? do u know where i can buy it for around that price still? I got mine from Hautelook, but I'm not sure if they still have it! Cake stand was found at Home Goods after searching for something functional/attractive on Amazon until my eyes bled. $29.99, sturdy, and I‚Äôm no longer knocking bottles over reaching in to a cluttered, tiny counter.

The brass containers/flowered holder/q-tip jar were all snagged at Cost Plus for under $15! And the ceramic piece was made by a friend. Holy crap what a great idea!  I have all my stuff below the sink because I hate how cheap and cluttery most shelves/boxes/trays etc make a counter look.  But that actually looks quite chic!

ETA - I use that same mascara.  Best ever!  (Bad Girl Bang Lash by Benefit, in case anyone was curious) Such a cute idea! I like the gold containers you have too. Also a two-tier lazy Susan! I love those for tight spaces and corner cupboards. So useful for vitamins, OTC meds, spices, skincare, anything you want really Nice. I like that wood stain color too. as someone who's day job is a maid... please everyone take note. That is nice! I might have to try this! I read the title and got excited but then sad when I saw the picture. (I literally have a stand-alone sink coming out of the wall with an inch-wide rim, ha.) I have a small, cheap bookshelf on my bench. It's great. Your solution is definitely more stylish though! Love it. Clever idea and wouldn‚Äôt have even known! Nice! I got a lazy susan from Costco that I'm using in my bathroom for a similar set up. That looks really good in the spot it's in it with the wood. May I ask how do you like the peeling solution? How you do like the sun bum mineral sunscreen? I‚Äôve tried the regular face sunscreen of theirs and loved it and thought about trying the mineral as well! AM:

- Simple Moisturizing Face Wash
- TO Vit C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%
- First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream
- Sun Bum Mineral SPF 50 Face Stick

PM:

- Simple Micellar Water
- Simple Moisturizing Face Wash
- TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
- First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream

Su:

- TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution

Acne isn‚Äôt a concern, but I‚Äôm trying to even out my skin and get some uniformity in my complexion and texture. 

So far, all 3 TO products I‚Äôm using seem to be helping with that, but it‚Äôs too soon to say. The only product I‚Äôm unsure of is the Sun Bum stick, which sits horribly under my makeup and makes me feel oily throughout the day. 

I plan to introduce Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA once I get a feel for how my skin likes the others, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions! Oh that is just lovely! Thank you so much for posting this! I'm not supposed to put holes in my walls for shelfs but have no counter space. I've looked at standing shelves but they're all expensive or too large. This would be PERFECT for my bathroom. Does it rotate? Love this idea! It looks so clean, especially with the gold accents. Will def keep this in mind for the future Gotta love The Ordinary the brushed gold + wood is giving me life yesss I LOVE that peel Fantastic idea! Looks great! 


(I might have to steal this idea lol) I have that same eyelash curler! Got it from Forever 21 haha This is so aesthetically pleasing! Love the idea As a baker who hoards cake stands, this is tragic.

But good god, it's an amazing idea. It looks so tidy! Looks great! Brilliant Absolutley brilliant. Really I am impressed! Love the concept! This is such a genius idea - thank you for sharing! Such a good idea! Doing this now! Great idea!!! Looks great! How are you lovin‚Äô the sun bum mineral sunscreen? Ingenious So cute!! This is a phenomenal idea Great idea! Is that the It Cosmetics illuminating CC cream? My absolute favorite U r so creative!! I would have never thought like this in a zillion years! Oh very cute idea This is genius. I love this idea! This is genius! It is a brilliant idea. The gold of the containers and wood on the stand complement each other. It is the most minimialist of shelves.  Truly excellent idea! Everything looks so effing chic. The gold, the minimalist matte ordinary bottles, everything is perfect. This is gorgeous! Love this! Super cute! Good idea! I have been looking for something! Super cute!! Looks awesome thanks for the inspiration ! what do you think of the niacinimide from TO? i have a bottle of it myself but i‚Äôm unsure of how it will be for my skin.... does it irritate your skin at all? did it cause you to purge at all? What a clever idea, looks so chic! Also I just bought a ton of stuff from the Ordinary for the first time, I noticed you seem to be a fan ;) Yasss. Thank you for this idea!!! [deleted] Hi there,

Thank you! This is genius, thank you for this!!! That looks so fancy! Great find! I got my shelf on my bathroom wall from the office section of a TJ Maxx and love it! Also I really love the style here with the wood and gold you accessories. So cute! I like how making a space like this for your skin routine makes that morning and night routine more enjoyable. It‚Äôs really cute Thsnk you for saying where you got it because I definitely need one for my bathroom now! Next level that ish with a lazy susan conversion. Do you like the ordinary skin care products?! I‚Äôve been hearing so much about them recently not even for acne but for helping skin disorders üòÖ it must be magic What is Cost Plus?? I love this and I‚Äôm just getting into gold decor. üíõ So smart!! I‚Äôve been trying to figure out accessible shelving for my bathroom! That‚Äôs genius I‚Äôve just gotten back from tj maxx and Marshall‚Äôs looking for something just like that. I will have to try homegoods. Looks great!! I fucking love the TJX owned stores

I always come out of there with something I didn't need but absolutely love üòÇ I just want to add, Goodwill is a great place to find neat storage options! I found my really pretty [mirror tray](https://imgur.com/71N9Op9) that I use for my skincare / hair care products there for under $5. I also collect a bunch of their pretty ornate glasses for storing stuff like [this one](https://imgur.com/ulB2k1l) I use for my liquid lipsticks. I highly recommend checking there first to save some $$$! I totally feel the same way. I so badly want to be someone who puts everything out of sight but I know that I almost always leave everything out every morning anyway. I compromised‚Äî these are just my daily essentials and the hoard is hidden ;) The brush on it is fantastic! My lashes stick straight out and the brush let‚Äôs me get in there to get some curl. Thank you! Cost Plus World Market has them in the candle section and super affordable. If you grew up in the 90s, maybe you remember those desk organizer lazy susans for school? I looooved those. I really wanted this to be a stationary organizer because I felt like I was always knocking things over and it would just domino in to a cascade of products on the floor. Maybe I‚Äôm just clumsy. Yup. Got one in the kitchen to hold stuff like vitamins and meds. Short and functional. Target has some really cute ones ;) Ha! If it makes you feel better, my sink has a HOT (as in scalding fucking hot) faucet on one side and a COLD (as in freezing cold) on the other. As you can imagine, AM/PM routines are super fun. Put up shelves! There are stick on ones on Amazon if you can't drill. I was looking for something like that! I did at least 40 laps around Home Goods trying to find a little baby shelf. Another user suggested the lazy susan too! I think I must just be really clumsy because bottles were forever just get knocked over and I worried that going that route would still be a problem for me. Total disclosure, I‚Äôm only about a week in to using TO (thanks to everyone here). I‚Äôm trying to even out my complexion both in texture and redness. I‚Äôve used it once and only for about 7 minutes to be on the safe side. A little bit of sensitivity the day after, but between using that the one time so far and the Vit C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% (AM)/Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (PM), I‚Äôm noticing some improvements. I plan to introduce Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA once I get a feel for how my skin likes these. It makes me so oily! My makeup hates it, so I‚Äôve been browsing for suggestions on alternatives. A friend of mine uses the regular and loves it, too, though. [deleted] That‚Äôs exactly why I wanted this! Gives a little height without the holes. Glad it‚Äôll work for you :) Nope. It‚Äôs rot iron and solid wood, so very heavy. I didn‚Äôt want something that rotated because I‚Äôm trying to avoid things being knocked over. Please do :) I was at such a loss and Amazon was disappointing. I wanted a departure from acrylic displays and I think it has a more refined look. I think mine came in a Boxycharm box haha Hahaha, so sorry to get in your lane. But thank you ;) Yes! I really like it a lot, too. I just bought the Anastasia Luminous foundation for fuller coverage when I‚Äôm doing a full face, but the IT Cosmetics is so light wear and nice! Hahaha. I live alone, so they‚Äôre both mine (maybe still not hygienic), but one is electric and the other isn‚Äôt. Done I keep finding myself in the bathroom looking at it and wanting to do my routine‚Äî you‚Äôre so right! Not OP, but I love them. They've done more for my skin than anything from Paula's Choice. Cheap too. [https://www.worldmarket.com](https://www.worldmarket.com) Awesome, thanks! :) I have never understood the point of having a faucet for each temperature. There must be a point or otherwise the concept wouldn‚Äôt have been invented but who in God‚Äôs name would want that?? Aw man. It's the worst when you have something in mind and can't find it. My shelf is old. Think I had it before I moved out of my mum's house (9 years ago now) lol. But it's brilliant. Mine has a very large lip, because I am also clumsy af Thanks for letting me know! I‚Äôve been curious about TO but haven‚Äôt tried it yet. Im also dealing with texture and redness. I‚Äôd love to know how t goes for you over the next few weeks. Right now I‚Äôm only using a gentle wash and moisturizer with a BP + adapalene cream... but I‚Äôd like to try out these products you have. Hope it goes well for you! Just saw this! Thanks! üôÇ I love them, actually! My face feels SO clean after the micellar and the wash. It‚Äôs all so affordable, too. Definitely looks better than the setup I have now with trays lol mine was 3 dollars lol hopefully you didnt get ripped off Great, thanks! Thanks! I‚Äôve been in some of my neighbor‚Äôs apartments and they‚Äôre all like that, so I‚Äôm choosing to believe it has something to do with living in an old 1900‚Äôs boarding house-turned-apartments with old, old plumbing. Because... why. Edit: suddenly realizing the irony of my cutting out sugar resulting in a newfound interest in skincare... displayed on a cake stand. I found that the Azeliac Acid from TO works really well for my redness, could also be helping with texture, but that's the first thing I noticed since I hadn't had any success with other products (also got a tip from someone on here to put a little bit of oil to make it spread better and it's been lasting longer). You too! I‚Äôve never taken a proactive stance (vs just washing my makeup off and spot treating zits)  on caring for my skin, but since I cut sugar out of my diet and my acne mostly disappeared, I started noticing the texture and uneven tone more. I‚Äôm still learning and it‚Äôs way too soon to tell what works. If anything, I‚Äôve never looked more hydrated and glowy, so I‚Äôll take it. It was done to prevent cross contamination of water supply.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-42948046 Haha that‚Äôs true. How long of cutting sugar from your diet did you notice a different. I‚Äôve been meaning to try that, but have never given it a true go because I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll do much. (Sorry for so many questions) Ooh, thank you! Super interesting, thank you! I‚Äôm in the US, but the logic seems to apply either way. Really, just a couple of weeks. It was the first thing I noticed and just a bonus (weight loss was my motivator). It‚Äôs reeeeally challenging the first leg, but once you rid your house of temptation, retrain your taste, and find suitable substitutes, it becomes second nature. I‚Äôm 100% convinced that sugar played a huge role in how my skin looked before. I‚Äôve never struggled with consistent acne too badly but it‚Äôs made a massive difference in the cystic acne I had alone my jawline. I also have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and it‚Äôs helped immensely with the skin related symptoms of that. Yeah I figured it was probably for similar reasons even though it was a uk article I only have cystic acne and it‚Äôs along my jaw. It‚Äôs consistently in the same place as well. As soon as one pimple leaves another comes in it‚Äôs place. You‚Äôve convinced me though, I‚Äôll give it a shot. Bit nervous that haha. You‚Äôve been a great help <3 **Hello everyone!**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* These look like great containers, thanks for sharing the link, I‚Äôve started decanting my products into little bottles to stop myself buying stuff just because it has pretty packaging! for those wondering, you can also get these at Daiso aside from Amazon! Details for those interested:

This is everything in my daily routine, minus the sunscreen (I'm waiting on an opaque bottle to put that in to protect from UV rays).

**AM:** Rinse with water, apply Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer (SPF 15)

**PM:** Remove makeup with Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water (pink cap), wash with Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, moisturize with Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion, finish with 2-3 spritzes of rose water (homemade)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Here is the **link to the airless pump bottles**: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TF65R1V/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TF65R1V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (I purchased the 15ml option and they're the perfect size for traveling or for a small bathroom counter like mine.)

&#x200B;

EDIT 2.0: Whoops‚Äîforgot to add reviews for the products! I'll list them all below.

* **Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer (SPF 15)** \- This is by far my favorite SPF moisturizer I've ever used. Relatively cheap and doesn't leave me feeling oily/filmy the way that most do. Sometimes I mix a little bit of liquid foundation in to create a homemade BB cream and it's the perfect consistency for that. \[Top 3\]
* **Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser** and **Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion** \- Simple, no frills, get the job done. I find that any time I try to mix things up with fancier cleansers and moisturizers that it tends to mess with my moisture barrier and I get oily. This cleanser doesn't dry me out and the lotion right afterwards keeps me moisturized all night (even though I sleep with my face right in a fan, which I know is a terrible habit). \[Top 3\]
* **Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water (pink cap)** \- I've never really noticed a difference in the various micellar waters that I've tried, but this one works just fine. I love being able to take my makeup off without using an oil-based cleanser, and this one comes in a big, cheap bottle at my grocery store so it's usually the one I go with.
* **Rose water** \- I originally started using rose water as a toner to help with an oily t-zone. That's all balanced out now and my main skincare goal is to maintain the moisture barrier that I've worked to repair over the last couple of years. I've really just kept it  in my routine because it feels refreshing and smells nice. It's a fun, refreshing last step to my routine before bed. Are all of these spray tops? The Amazon description of these bottles makes it seem as though all the bottles have spray nozzles. Is it possible to clean those bottles? Of do you need to buy new ones if you have an empty product and you want to use them for something else? These are gorgeous.  Can you share the link or name of stoe where you bought these? To be even more minimal, mix all into a single bottle. What difference does it make to get an airless pump vs a regular one? At first I thought this was silly then I thought about it for a moment and it‚Äôs insanely brilliant. 

This will encourage you to buy products for what they contain and not pretty packaging or because it‚Äôs name brand. You probably lose a bit in the transfer (even a tiny tiny amount but some will be lost) but it‚Äôs worth it if you‚Äôre paying a fraction of the price for because you no longer even consider things just for the brand. Curious how this is ‚Äúminimal‚Äù....you‚Äôre still having to buy new bottles when your products run out, and I assume their full contents don‚Äôt fit in these pumps, so you‚Äôre having to store the full-sizes somewhere too. You‚Äôre just adding bottles, the exact opposite of ‚Äúgoing minimal‚Äù?

Nothing wrong with appreciating the ~aesthetic, but that‚Äôs all this is at the end of the day. Love the aesthetic! My only concern would be if you have any ingredients that are sensitive to light they might degrade since the bottles are not opaque. I love this aesthetic, it's so clean and classy! How does one transfer the content to the airless pump container without contaminating the content? Have you tried using the rosewater before the occlusive moisturizer? Nice! I'm also minimal skincare. Just micellar water, SPF moisturizer, and night cream here! I did the same just last week, but more for hygiene/ expiration concerns (especially retinol expires faster if it regularly comes in contact with fresh air). I bought a [4 pack](https://www.amazon.de/MYLL-Kunststoff-Pumpspender-Kosmetik-Beh%C3%A4lter/dp/B07CG9DBQY/) on german amazon and I love them. I also like the 'clean' look. I discovered the same ones on [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000030678430.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.260e4a9aa56fap&algo_pvid=aad9dd5e-cb22-4776-9dc9-7b8a65b18b98&algo_expid=aad9dd5e-cb22-4776-9dc9-7b8a65b18b98-1&btsid=d436aa43-ba96-4672-9a4d-35ee72a82c56&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_52) in different sizes and types, but I dunno how to feel about it. I kinda feel like aliexpress stuff is not as safe, but on the other hand it's pretty likely that the seller of my bottles himself bought them there. Also, in the end it's mostly plastic, so it should not be unsanitary as long as it is disinfected, should it? You guys should check AliExpress for these bottles. I notice a lot of sellers on Amazon are just straight from China.

[same bottles here?](https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32927706638.html) 

[cheaper black ones](https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32927706638.html) Oeeh that looks nice! I would love to do this but I have too many things that look alike in color and in viscosity and I might end up mixing them up :( COSRX‚Äôs snail cream comes in the most unhygienic pot. I‚Äôm so down to transfer it into this. Did you use a little funnel or anything to help get the product in or are the mouths of the containers quite wide? Can you link them, please??!?! These are so cute! So clean looking I love this so much. Great idea. Where did you get the pump bottles from? I have these too because I had gotten like 5 samples of cerave which I all put into one of these. They are *so practical* and they're good for travelling I love it! These actually look great for traveling! pretty They look great but if they were in my possession, I wouldn‚Äôt be fucked to refill them.

I‚Äôd likely get the original containers and throw away the small ones. This is such a cool idea!! Looks lovely!! <3 Do you make your own lotion? I just bought some of these! They look so nice. Do you think Vaseline could go in a bottle like this? I'm a minimalist too and one thing that has always bothered me is mismatched beauty/skin products. (Don't get me started on 1/2 full containers that I KNOW I have abandoned but will not forgive myself for wasting) I make my own bottles too so they all matched.  People have told me I was going too far (like I have OCD) but it's good to know I'm not alone! 
Besides, have you ever seen a home and garden magazine picture with the medicine cabinet or vanity looking a hot mess?  No, it's organized and usually has very few things in it. And they're matching;)

Now off to find me a kahkie colored toothbrush üòÇ I found your post few weeks ago and order them. I had some trouble transferring my cream into it, did you find a better method than using a small spatula? Just checked, there are options for similar containers available on Lazada. For those interested ‚ù§Ô∏è What are your opinions on rose water? So pretty Hi! I've got an airless pump bottle at home that I wanna use, do you have to fill it to the top with the cream (mine would be a face moisturiser) so that it will work? The colours are also really satisfying! Good idea Do you have a link for these bottles? They look awesome!!! This is a great idea‚ÄîI definitely fall victim to that as well! It looks nice, but it seems like you'd run out fast and have to refill them again.

Maybe I'm just lazy, but that seems like it would make me not want to use them. What does it mean to decant your products? Why do you do it? I have done this in the past, but they stopped carrying them about a year ago, as far as I can tell! Have you found them recently? What section are they in? I‚Äôm in Japan so hoping I can find them! What is the plastic like on those bottles? I've used airless pump bottles before but the plastic was a little too hard and brittle, so the caps cracked after being barely squished while traveling. Thanks for the idea! I travel often and just bought the 1 oz airless lotion dispensers ( not spray) from Amazon. What does the rose water do?

My grandma and aunt always tell me what I use rose water-glycerin+lemon drops on my skin before bed and during winter.

I have never tried it though!

Also, you use Cetaphil and I use Cerave. I don't know when or exactly why I started using Cerave, but I want to know if it's a good idea to switch to Cetaphil because it's cheaper for me and I want to see if I can get away with using that (since I don't remember why I started Cerave)

I have an oily t-zone and dry rest of the face
How'd Cetaphil been for you? I see a lot of people say you shouldn‚Äôt decant sunscreens because the exposure to light breaks down the SPF component of the product, if you care for that part of your moisturiser. It may be worth covering the bottle or painting it darker. How did you make the rose water? Sry if this is a really dumb question lol Is spf 15 enough for daily use? I ask because spf 15 lotion is the highest I can use without hating how my skin feels with higher spf‚Äôs. I always feel guilty I‚Äôm not using a higher spf Hi there,

After you've done that, please reply to this comment.
 
Thank you! Can‚Äôt wait to go back to my Cetaphil gentle cleanser. So looking at the Amazon link you posted, they have a fine mist spray nozzle? How does this work with your creams/lotions? I would be worried it would clog or be hard to spray? I want to try this for my Hado Lado Skin Plumping Gel Cream, my Tony Moly Panda's Magic Cream and my Make Prem Peel Me Sleeping Mask but I'm worried they will clog the nozzle. I have the same set. Only i use it for travel sets. will consider using it after I move They are spray tops, but they dispense the lotion and the face wash just fine. The stream is just thinner than from a regular pump dispenser (which I actually like, because it allows me more control over the amount of product I use). It is‚Äîthe pump unscrews from the top easily. (It's also how you fill the bottles.) Yes you can clean them (not OP but I have the same ones and I use them for travel). I‚Äôm curious about this as well Absolutely! I just added the link to my original comment for the sake of keeping all info in one place. [These](https://www.amazon.com/Airless-Bottles-Yebeauty-Empty-Bottle/dp/B07RL6WL59/ref=mp_s_a_1_2_sspa?keywords=airless+pump+bottle&qid=1570385023&sprefix=airless+pum&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyV0xMVUpYR1AxNUpKJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjkyMzEzMkpFV1FTUDBLTDBKMiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTY3NjIzRzdEQ1pUWEhKTFhYJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfcGhvbmVfc2VhcmNoX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU= ) from amazon look pretty similar amazon has some good glass ones Hahahaha‚Äîif only. Two main reasons:

1) A conventional pump bottle doesn't dispense product as efficiently as the bottle empties because the straw/tube can no longer draw it up.

2) An airless pump prevents the product from being exposed to air, which helps to prevent the oxidization that can happen to ingredients in some products and decrease their effectiveness. I think by minimal she means on her small counter and not her overall bathroom storage. They‚Äôre easy to reach and have a good aesthetic. I know I personally like having my face wash next to my sink but I just keep it in the original packaging so she probably wanted to use less space. I thought minimal referred to the routine - just the sheer number of products involved and not about the bottles? I travel a lot, and this would be super cost effective rather than buying travel sized products. According to OP's link these are reusable as well, so not wasteful. Some might want to go to the clutter free aesthetic, and I agree this looks much neater than having the full sized packaging standing these. I guess it's individual as to how practical or minumal it would be having to store the full sized products elsewhere. :) Buying in bulk is more cost effective and eco friendly. Now she can get the big bottles Minimal in the aesthetic sense‚Äîthis is a simpler, cleaner look for my countertop and allows me to store the full-size containers out of sight. [deleted] As someone about to live on the road for the next 12 months this is a perfect minimal option for me. Yes the original bottles will still exist, but they just can‚Äôt fit in the 4WD with us as space is so limited. So we have had to come up with a minimal carry system. We will purchase most products and toiletries in bulk before leaving and they will be staying at a friends, along with winter clothes, extra hats etc. We will have one set of pump bottles like this with us and one left with the bulk purchase. When we get close to running out we will have the second lot of pump bottles posted (along with whatever else we need to swap) and upon its arrival we will post back the empties for refilling along with out of season (weather wise) clothing. So on and so forth for the 12 months. ü§ûüèΩ fingers crossed this system will work well. You know these are refillable right? Where did you get the idea that you need new bottles every time? I had a similar thought, so I ordered an opaque bottle for my SPF lotion. The pump unscrews from the top so that you can pour/pump product directly into the bottle. Then, you just screw the pump back on and pump out any excess air. I use a makeup spatula to transfer product. I used to when I was using it as a toner for my oily t-zone, but honestly I just have it in my routine now because it smells nice and it's a refreshing thing to do right before bed, so I do it last. It makes things so much quicker and easier! Hi! Just wanted to let you know that your comment was removed because it appears to contain aliexpress affiliate links.

Can you edit the URL to the following?

- "same bottles here": https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32927706638.html

- "cheaper black ones" just redirects to the main aliexpress site, so I'm not sure what the product link for that one is

Let me know when you've updated the links so I can approve your comment :) No reason you couldn't label them. I've used funnels I have in my kitchen. Also got a couple large syringes on Amazon to fill some tiny travel tubes I use - you can wash and reuse the syringes. Freaked out my husband though, he had just come home from the hospital after surgical complications when he opened that Amazon box. Felt kinda bad about that... The mouths of the containers aren‚Äôt super wide, but all of these products came in either pump or squirt bottles, so I didn‚Äôt a need a funnel. Thanks! I edited my original comment to include a link to the page where I purchased them. Amazon‚ÄîI posted the link to the page where I bought them in my original comment. They‚Äôre the perfect size to pack in a toiletry bag! I‚Äôm happy to not have to buy/make separate travel sized containers anymore. No, see my original comment for product info. A couple of other people have asked similar questions, and I think vaseline might be too viscous for the spray nozzle on these bottles. However, I'm sure you can find airless pump bottles that have a more traditional, wider nozzle on them that would work just fine. In fact, I think airless pump bottles would be better for a thick product like that because it doesn't have to get sucked up through a straw or a tube to be dispensed. All of my containers have pump tops, and that made transferring the product a breeze. It's nice, but not really necessary! I have a rose water spray with glycerin that I like to use before moisturizer, and my witch hazel is scented with rose, but it's mostly because I like the smell. It's especially helpful if you use hyaluronic acid, so the HA has external moisture to absorb (instead of sucking it out of your face). I'm not Op but recently started using rosewater as my toner in the mornings, since my main toner contains acids and 2x a day was a little too harsh, and as someone with dehydrated skin it's pretty nice. Pure rose water doesn't do a lot compared to hydrating toners I've had before, but I always apply my moisturiser on damp toned skin and did notice the rosewater soothes my skin a little and helps hydrate. It's a nice choice if someone just wants to get some dirt of their face but aren't huge toner lovers, since rosewater is pretty cheap, and compared to witch hazel is not drying\~ [deleted] I like it! I originally started using it as a toner to help with some oiliness I was experiencing. That's all balanced out now, so I've really just kept it in my routine because it feels refreshing and smells nice. It's a nice way to wrap things up and send myself off to bed feeling refreshed. I prefer orange blossom water. You don‚Äôt need to fill it all the way‚Äîyou can just pump out any extra air if there‚Äôs empty space left. I posted a link to them in my original comment! :) I keep looking at the glow products but I‚Äôm 99% sure it‚Äôs just because the packaging is beautiful! Have to be honest, this is tickling every bit of my OCD right now. I really like it. I saw them in an Australian Daiso about 2 months ago. I saw them at a SoCal Daiso about a month ago! They have them in Sacramento I‚Äôm from the Philippines oop I‚Äôm also in Japan and hoping they‚Äôre here! The plastic seems to be good quality, and pretty thick. I haven't traveled with them yet, though, so I'll have to see how they hold up to more than just daily use. I love Cetaphil‚ÄîI actually switched from Cerave for the exact same reason ($$) and I haven't noticed any difference.

Re: the rose water, I originally started using it as a toner to help with an oily t-zone. That's all balanced out now, so I've really just kept it in my routine because it feels refreshing and smells nice. Your grandma made a low ph toner xD. A lot of people are against lemon on the face but it‚Äôs mostly just citric acid and in low enough concentrations in the right ph, it can be good for the skin. I ordered an opaque bottle for my SPF moisturizer. It hasn't arrived yet, so I haven't decanted that yet. The moisturizer in this pic doesn't have SPF. You need to distill it, it's a hydro sol. Boil it and collect the steam, its kinda hard to do yourself. My friend made it for me so I'm not super familiar with it, but I'm pretty sure you just simmer rose petals in water until the color leaves them. Not totally sure though. You know, I feel similarly guilty about it sometimes. But like you I just can't stand how anything higher feels on my skin on a daily basis. I take slight comfort in the fact that my foundation also has SPF in it.

(I do use Neutrogena Sport Face (SPF 70) if I'm spending extended amounts of time outside, like a beach day or while I'm hiking, but that's it.) I have the same problem. I got the Drunk Elephant trial kit and it came with their Spf 30 tinted sunscreen, umbra tinte. Its amazing I don't feel it at all. I want to try the non tinted version and see if its the same. The only problem is it's so expensive. I wonder if it's one of those things you just have to spend money on if you want a product that doesn't feel sticky/oily at all. All done! Thanks! It‚Äôs definitely a fine stream of lotion rather than a big glob, but it doesn‚Äôt ever clog for me. The pump feels pretty powerful. How thick or thin of a product can you put in those airless bottles? Would something as thick as vaseline go through fine? Or something as thin as plain water? How do you clean them? I mean getting into the pump system looks difficult. Thanks! Does it matter if the product was a cream, oil, etc or does it work for all types? She is only using four products including sunscreen so this is still minimal. She also could have bought the big bottles without buying the pumps. New bottles of the original products that she‚Äôs emptying into these pumps. Oh sorry, I had no idea they even had those. I just used the share button from the app. They're fixed now I think. That's my favorite part! If I'm feeling really decadent, I'll print out labels with fancy shmancy cursive font.  The possibilities are endless and suddenly, my cetaphil looks like an organic, vegan, cruelty free goat milk from France. Thank you! I would love to get some pump action for my vaseline. What mechanism would make rose hydrosol inherently drying? I've never heard that. Not gonna lie to you I bought the Glow Watermelon night moisturizer because of the packaging a few months ago, and it's held up beautifully. It's a very viscous milky jelly and it lingers on the skin a bit, but it leaves my skin very soft and hydrated. I've found that I do need to rinse it off in the morning with water though. I love my watermelon glow but it is super pricey! I got one with a free sleeping mask inside and it‚Äôs the most comfortable mask ever almost me but that price tag,... I probabaly will buy it sometime but not now. Sounds like they might be reborn! I'll give it a shot. Thanks :) I hope they hold up well! I‚Äôm taking a trip to a conference next week so just snatched up some of the 15mL ones. I‚Äôm tired of really crappy travel bottles I keep trying to buy at TJ Maxx. Thankfully I‚Äôll only be on the train/driving so I don‚Äôt need to be worried about TSA or anything. Thanks!! what brand of rose water do you use? Can you show us which you went with for your spf? Is it similar in style? Ah right, I read that as your sunscreen as you noted it was SPF15. Perfect, thank you! I think it depends on the nozzle type. The spray nozzle on these does just fine with a medium weight lotion, but I think something as thick as vaseline might be tough. You'd probably need to get a bottle with a regular nozzle (not a spray top) for that. I assume the airless/vacuum feature would work with any consistency of product, though.  


Let me know if you try it with something thicker! I found em as pumps!

LONGWAY 1 Oz (30ML) Empty Airless Pump Bottles | Travel Lotion Pump Containers/Airless Lotion Dispenser - for Refillable Cosmetic Bottle, Foundation Pump NO BPA (Pack of 6, Clear) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BQR5SLB/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_DtOMDbFR4J5VR My plan is just to pump a water/cleanser mixture through the pump until it rinses clean. Yeah they actually get pretty clean, I was surprised. I just pump water through until everything is flushed out and leave them out to dry. When there is product inside they are pretty airtight so they don‚Äôt seem to accumulate any ‚Äúfunk‚Äù. üòù I think the only thing that wouldn't work would be something extremely viscous (like vaseline). Exactly! :) She said she has a small bathroom counter, so large bottles probably won't fit. These are also less visually cluttered than having a bunch of branded bottles around on the counter. So it would make a small space seem tidier. Yeah, this looks like a waste of plastic, especially since most airless pump bottles aren't reusable. No worries! To be entirely honest I wasn't familiar with aliexpress affiliate links before this, so I'm not sure on all the details of what goes into it. 

Those links still look a little suspect to me ("aff_trace_key") - I'm pretty sure it's just something the app tacks onto the links just to track stuff, but would you mind editing them just one more time to the links below? It's more for my own peace of mind than anything üòÖ

First link ("same bottles"): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32927706638.html

Second link ("cheaper black ones"): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32927706638.html

I'm sorry for all the trouble! Actual rose hydrosol is recommended for dry skin, like the Heritage Store Rosewater (not the one with vinegar). But it needs to be quickly followed by a moisturizer to lock the moisture in. Some rosewaters have glycerin which helps hydrate more. But other "rosewaters" are just rose colored and scented liquids that aren't as great for your skin. And if it has alcohol avoid completely if you have dry skin. me too! it‚Äôs the only eye mask that stays on securely. i love it for road trips:) Nooo, now I really want it, the moisturiser was what I was after as I need a lighter day moisturiser, have you tried it? The Cetaphil Moisturizing lotion (the one in the big pump, that says for body/face, all skin types) actually makes me feel really oily. I have fairly dry skin to begin with, and that doesn't usually happen to me. But its so bad for me, that Im just using it on my body....and even then I dont like it, cause then I feel oily everywhere. 

I got a big 2 pack of the big pumps from costco when they were on sale, so I have a huge supply. So I guess I keep using it. But I will be switching back to Cerave for my moisturizer. It‚Äôs homemade (I have a friend who makes it) This is the opaque set I bought: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C97BXV6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_jW2MDbKM5RS8B

Couldn‚Äôt find just a single, small opaque one, but I figure I‚Äôll use the larger two in the set for other toiletries when traveling (shampoo, body wash, etc.). I'd like to know as well Alright I'll have to give it a try. Nice, but I'm in Canada and our amazon has very little selection unfortunately. Still found some though! deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6130  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/16916) Thanks for finding a link! How can you sanitize them? I'd think cleanser and water wouldn't sanitize them. okay. Thank you for the information. Still a bit worried about mold bit maybe of you push an alcohol solution through it, it probably will be okay. Thanks again for taking the time to reply! The airless ones are more expensive where I'm from and the lady selling them wasn't all to helpful so I just didn't bother. I don't understand how a bottle that's meant to be filled with any product wouldn't be reusable. Sorry!! I tried searching on firefox but still on mobile. I actually just opened one of your links too cause it wouldnt copy. 

Next time I'll just say what to search. 

Thanks for fixing them! What hydrosol has alcohol? I use both regular witch hazel and witch hazel hydrosol, and there's a complete difference. Oh sure, I personally understand that. I just took issue with the broad, unsubstantiated statements from the initial commenter. I'll probably just sanitize them like I do my other tools/makeup brushes/etc.‚Äîcleaning, then spritzing with rubbing alcohol and air drying. Because it's an airpump, it's got essentially a vacuum chamber inside it. If you open the vacuum chamber to refill the bottle, it will break the seal and ruin it. If it wasn't an airpump it would be reusable, but because of the seal, which would be damaged if re-opened, it's not re-usable. Thank you for editing your comment, approved!! :D

Again, thank you so much for putting up with me and editing the links multiple times. I know it's a real pain in the arse on mobile! A lot of people confuse actual hydrosols with things like "rose water". That's what I meant. Like Garnier has a "rose" mist, but it has alcohol. Well she did say correct me if I'm wrong. :) With all the misleading marketing around products it can become confusing for consumers. I felt she was concerned and just trying to help. I have airless pump bottles for some of my products and I've refilled them many times. I've reused these same brand of bottles for over a year now. They don't break. You use a long, thin item to push the bottom back down, and refill. I personally use these for large tubs of Cerave, as well as any other potted skin care items and repeatedly putting fingers into them isn't the best. I wasn't aware there was confusion. Regular witch hazel can get gotten for as low as $1, Hydrosol reminds me of alchemy they way it's made. The price reflects that. 

I would put something I mixed with hydrosol in my hair, I would never put regular witch hazel in my hair. It has 14% alcohol. 

Typing all of this just made me realize, you and are aren't included in, "a lot of people". Ha, I thought that was about OP's oily skin! 1000% agree about misleading marketing. A skin-conscious friend of mine won't wear makeup on flights in favor of masking, but she obsessively uses a Kiehl's in-flight mist... where the second ingredient is denatured alcohol, and the third ingredient is glycerin! Where is the glycerin going to get moisture from, the dry cabin air? LOL true. Then again I've made my own tinctures and herbal blends before. Love the alchemy metaphor! Guess we're more familiar with these products than many!?

PS  Did I come across as condescending or something? Sorry - I'm just tired of some products using words like hydrosol and there's just a tiny amount of hydrosol in it or maybe no hydrosol in it and it just being a marketing device. 

EDIT: apparently this comment came off know-it-all or something I had to look up that product. That ingredient list is a disaster. Love that they tout the amazing botanicals (in miniscule amounts) and change an ungodly amount ü§®. Um, no thanks Kiehls Hey everyone. 

It looks like this thread has been brigaded. A large part of the comments are friendly and talk about skincare - like you're used to from this community! But a significant amount of comments - mostly from people who seem to be new to ScA - are pretty hateful and off topic. Because of that, we've decided to lock this post for now, which means that no new comments can be made even though the post is still visible. 

OP, I'm really sorry this happened! Thank you for staying calm throughout all of this. I hope it hasn't put you off from participating in /r/SkincareAddiction. 

Have a great day everyone! Edit #2 to make my comment more in line with the rules of "shelfies"

33M here, new to this subreddit and skincare in general. My girlfriend is always talking about her routines and had helped me so much! She sent me these things to help with my skincare and make sure I'm taken care of.

My skin type is all over the place. I'm oily on my forehead and nose, but super dry on my cheeks and beard.

My Routine: 

AM: 

‚Ä¢Cleanser: CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser 

‚Ä¢Moisturizer: CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion

‚Ä¢Moisturizer #2: The Ordinary Virgin Marula Oil

‚Ä¢Face Sunscreen: CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion w/ SPF 30

‚Ä¢Lip Balm: Carmex chapstick w/ Sunscreen

PM: 

‚Ä¢Cleanser: CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser

‚Ä¢Moisturizer: CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion

‚Ä¢Moisturizer #2: The Ordinary Virgin Marula Oil

‚Ä¢Moisturizer #3: CeraVe Skin Renewing cream serum

‚Ä¢Lip Balm: Carmex chapstick w/ Sunscreen

Everyone already knows all about the basic CeraVe lotion and cleanser. I wasn't using anything to clean my face, so using these is where I started and they work for me.

The big difference for my routine than others I've seen is The Ordinary Virgin Marula Oil. I get psoriasis/patchy dry skin on my chin under my beard. I don't have a long beard, because I am in the military and its not allowed, but the 1/4 inch I do have gets really dry. This oil has helped me a ton prevent those patches, and makes my chin feels super hydrated without excessive oil residue. It just works.

The CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion w/ SPF 30, as others have mentioned, can cause some build up and kinda of turn your face white. I use small amounts and make sure to rub it in first before leave the room. I mostly focus this on my cheeks and forehead. I am not really in the sun that often as I work in an office and wear a hat at all times outside, but still good to have sunscreen in your routine.

The CeraVe Skin Renewing Cream Serum I actually found in another persons care package here, and since I didn't really have that I wanted to try it at night. Just something different to maybe help with my wrinkles as I am getting older. It doesn't leave any residue on my skin and overall has made my skin feel better when I wake up the next morning.

Edit to add that /u/koontzk is my girl and she's the best. She saw this :) I wish it was more common for men skincare to be out in the public eye (?). I try to help my boyfriend with his issues but he‚Äôs 1. lazy 2. Doesn‚Äôt see the big deal. I have the same cerave spf 30, does any one else find that it collects together when applying it and get peely? Awe that‚Äôs very sweet of her. Nice routine. Hope CeraVe works well for you! Didn't for me You‚Äôre well taken-care of! These are all solid products! [deleted] Has anyone had experience with the Marula Oil and Eczema? 
I get Eczema under my eyes, on my eyelids, in my hairline, on my neck, in my eyebrows and on my forehead. 
My allergist seems to think it's allergies but when it started popping up on my forehead I began to think otherwise. I could be wrong I just don't want to get allergy shots and continue using steroid cream if I can avoid it all. Where can I buy that Cerave serum? Never seen it before in stores Aww, this is sweet and that's a solid routine. She's a keeper. Because of this sub I went out and bought a bunch of cerave products.. only to break out terribly. I don‚Äôt understand how this product is so loved by so many. How do you like the Marula Oil?  I get really bad eczema breakouts, especially during the summer and winter time, and I've been looking for something that might help that, and lessening the pigmentation of my eczema scars. the good shit üëå Ive had zero luck in finding info other places, but is the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for the face or for body? And if its for face, how does it differ from the Facial Moisturizing Lotion? For what do you use that oil? Hey, I‚Äôm fairly new to the skincare routine life too and I own a couple Cerave products as well such as the AM/PM moisturizer and the skin cleanser.

May I ask what the serum in the picture is used for exactly? And also where does that fit in your routine? I‚Äôve never seen or heard of it before. Try to get a stronger SPF sunscreen. The UV rays in the middle east are "extreme" if you're going there. "burns in minutes" Hi there,

Thank you! [removed] I wish I could do this for my bf, he washes his face with 3 in 1 shampoo :‚Äô( This is amazing! Good luck to you both during your deployment üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è Hi hi!! I (F20) LOVE this community! I‚Äôm learning something new everyday from you guys:) 
Why is Cerave THE go-to cleanser/moisturizer for you? I have been using Cerave‚Äôs foaming cleanser for about 2 weeks now but my acne and skin isn‚Äôt as clear as it was before I switched. Any suggestions??? Moisturizer with SPF is one of the three most important things to prevent aging of your skin. Keep up the good work. There is more skin care advice at r/SkinHealth . Also, hang on to that girl haha I'm a dude with everything except the Ordinary bottle and the CeraVe serum.i don't have  psoriasis, so I guess I don't need the bottle? But what about the serum? Should I get that? Thank you for your service and thank your GF for her service [removed] what effect has the oil had with your skin? I have scalp psoriasis and am barely getting into skincare myself Hey I just bought that. I like it so far. For rubbing one out over there? I want to ask you both how your girlfriend managed to convince you to be on a skincare routine.  My partner is so lazy :( I'm trying to get my military husband into skincare but the Army has made him use dish soap he says haha! I make a routine and he said he would maybe try but only if he can combine everything into one bottle... I've got some work to do! But good for you for taking care of your skin, don't forget sunscreen!! I didn't see it in your lineup. Thank you for your service [salute emoji] Honestly me with my boyfriend CeraVe??!???????? But ur gonna break out opers u shoulda got spf +150 by aveeno Goals üò©üò©üò© [removed] It's just moon dust in my eye.  Not like...tearing up or anything üíñ [removed] Some times simple is best! Very nice that she helped you out, it certainly is not easy to acquire personal care products outside of soap when deployed. Good luck :) My BF is deployed and I haven‚Äôt sent him any skin care products! I need to. Did it take you awhile to get used to using the products? Your gf is amazing! also if you're out all day in the desert sun, try to reapply at least once midday or in the afternoon! Facial sunscreen inevitably gets worn off by small touches, sweating that we're always doing, etc. That AM sunscreen has zinc which is great Fyi that moisturizer with sunscreen only has enough protection for like an hour. You should be using more sunscreen, please. Especially in the desert. I know very few people over fifty that have not had skin cancers removed. This is the best shelfie! All my faves. That's love right there. Which one is the Cerave Night Cream? Thank you for your service! It may be a good idea to add an additional sunscreen and reapply every 2 hours. Does anyone know about sunscreens in Iraq or Afganistan? If any are good maybe you could get a good deal! Omg this is the sweetest thing.

You two are so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm a dude and I‚Äôm completely obsessed with it. Right now I‚Äôm trying retinol on my teenage skin and the purging is NOT fun. Some of the guys in my class call me gay for having nice skin (almost all of them have bad skin so maybe they‚Äôre jealous idk) and they‚Äôll soon find out that they were right! ;)

I definitely think that men‚Äôs skincare needs to be more accepted, it can make a huge difference. My dad almost never wears sunscreen and we live in a really sunny climate and he looks considerably older than other people his age who use sunscreen.

I really hope the feminine stigma associated with skincare goes away. Seriously! I was at the Clinique counter in Nordstrom and this lady was mind blown that her husband could use the same products as her. The associate even had to explain that men and women indeed have the same skin lol Soo many guys think that they don't have to maintain their skin. While mens skin is tougher, it does not always "age better" as people assume. And it can also get dry/damaged like womans skin can. After all, skin is the largest organ. 

I think cleansing and using sunscreen is like brushing your teeth. It's basic maintenance. I dunno, if my boyfriend tried to help me ‚Äúfix my issues‚Äù I‚Äôd probably resist. I feel like if someone wants the help then giving it is fair, but if he doesn‚Äôt care neither should you. Imagine the tables being turned My bf was like this at first then in the last few years he's been getting some uneven skin tone from sun exposure mostly and it turns out he's actually a little vain about his youthful looks so it hasn't been that hard to get him to use a routine, though I still usually initiate it. Very similar routine to OPs mostly Ceravae products and occasionally some rose hip oil when his skin is really dry. I'm a man, but gay oops. Some straight men (let's be honest here) associate skincare as being something feminine. I just see it as self care and there's nothing wrong with that imo. I've gifted a Paulas Choice moisturizer + SPF

brother: Thanks but I don't really use this kinda stuff.

me: that's exactly why I gave it to you

brother: I don't think I need it

me: ???? I've always been lazy with it! Just keep at him and hopefully he'll come around. I JUST started my husband on rosehip oil for an overall moisturizer. It takes time, especially if they see you do the routine regularly. I had that issue layering it over hyaluronic acid moisturizer.

edit: but really only then. Now I put it over vitamin E oil (I‚Äôm on accutane) and it doesn‚Äôt bother me unless I have a layer of dry skin that I need to shed. I wasn't a huge fan of it when I used it. I always felt like I needed to wash my face right afterwards I have had the exact same problem! I am currently looking into other options as I haaate the way it acts on my face. I really don't use very much, just mostly on my receding hairline lol, so I haven't had that issue. :) I'm so scared of this product.  When I was getting into skincare, I bought it.  I washed and moisturized my face twice a day, I assumed that was right and I had to literally stop doing any of it because it burned so bad to put anything on my face.   Now I know to only wash my face once a day, with a light cleanser and my face is great.  I use St Ives moisturizer and I like it at night, but I need something during the day and I'm thinking of going back to this moisturizer...  I'm just so scared.  I'm thinking of adding it to my routine on Thursday.. Agreed. Sadly it‚Äôs not for everyone. 

I actually found solace in the Bulldog face wash and moisturizer though! Yeah cerave broke me out. All their products did. Thankfully Vanicream cleanser & lite lotion work for me. It's honestly like most sunblocks, turns my face kinda white when I put it on at first, a little thick, but goes away after a few minutes of soaking in. Never had issues washing it off or even thought about it I have it, it‚Äôs medium thickness and goes on white, you have to rub it in for a while. It‚Äôs not my favorite tbh. [deleted] That particular one I found here in another persons care package and they didn't want it! Lol I've seen it at Target, if you have one of those. I‚Äôm in Canada and got it at Walmart I found some at CVS. You may be sensitive to fatty alcohols. There's a lot of posts in this sub that discusses that too! Because it has helped others Idk, I'm new to this... Sorry to hear that, it's only helped me. I know everyone has different reactions to stuff though. Saaaame! Just looking at this post gave me flashbacks to cystic acne that I have NEVER had issues with before. I still have scars :( When you read through the cerave ingredients list there are multiple sensitizers - some that have even been linked to eczema & psoriasis. To be honest I've just gotten it recently. My chin gets really flakey and dry, with red raised psoriasis kinda patches, and since I've gotten it I haven't had any. It always comes and goes though so I'm waiting to see if it comes back. Fellow eczema sufferer here - I find marula oil works very well as a nightly moisturizer. TO Squalane made it worse for me though. Right now I'm using the cetaphil eczema moisturizer, and that too works well (so far). The big one is for both, the little one has sunscreen. Its for dry skin, I use it on my chin for the patches/psorosis I have under my beard. Its for dry skin, I use it on my chin for the patches/psorosis I have under my beard. I'm not out in the sun too long fortunately. Only a few minutes going to a from work most days. I think I fixed it :) I did. The formatting is bad because I'm on mobile, but it's the top comment. I did as best I could do to follow the rules. What is missing? I'm the joke? You're so ignorant you don't even understand there are jobs in the military that don't even carry weapons. I am a meteorologist. I don't bomb anyone, slaughter anyone... I sit in an office. I don't see how I'm the joke when you're the one coming to a skincare thread to attack people ;) After 11.5 years being together, I got my husband into products.  It was his idea, too.  I was using Calamine lotion on my face to get rid of redness and he asked me if I thought it would work on his face.  He is so happy he made that change. 

Long story short, there could be a day.. Thanks :) I'm not qualified to make suggestions, I'm too new! I was just told to use this stuff, I did, and it works for me. I wish I could help more lol It is cheap and widely available. Sadly you are one of the unlucky people in the group that it actually causes to break out. I personally don‚Äôt use any other cleanser but I do hear good  things about Bulldog Cleansers and Krave cleansers [removed] I've had to remove your comment because it breaks Rule 1: Be kind and respectful.

I recently started using it but it is helpful. Jus a fwe drops and the skin is super hydrated for the day.

If you'd like to know more, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_1._be_kind_and_respectful.). For the past few weeks I‚Äôve been using only CeraVe cleanser and moisturizers and my skin is the best it‚Äôs ever been. 12/10 would recommend a simple, consistent routine. Nope! Gotta have something to do here. I'm learning this! I will get more! Is it because SPF30? Curious. Thanks! I think the renewing serum but also want to know True! The fact that we even have to call it men's skincare shows many people view it as a woman's activity. It's like saying here's skincare, but also we have *men's* skincare. Well breaking news everybody has skin. 16 year old dude here, would you recommend Retinol? I‚Äôm trying to get a skin routine going, all I have is Cerave face wash, a toner, and cerave moisturizer. I hope the stigma with being feminine also goes away. Toxic masculinity 101 lol

Good on you for not buying into their BS and doing your thing. That shit's hard, especially at your age. I‚Äôm hoping that it becomes more universal for everyone! I just got my brother some TO products for his 18th bday and he‚Äôs already loving the routine and the way his skin feels. Plus he already uses sunscreen (so proud). 

I‚Äôm feeling older sister protectiveness for you because my brother is gay and an incredible human. Keep applying the skincare and living as yourself. You‚Äôll be happy and have amazing skin too! Maybe one day, the rest of those guys will catch on lol. 1. Nothing wrong with being gay
2. Having cared for skin is great for everyone! I wish my bf cared a bit more about skincare but he‚Äôs one of those people that rarely gets acne so he doesn‚Äôt see the point for himself. At least he doesn‚Äôt do what his sister does & tan until she‚Äôs brown. She already had crows feet at 29 when I met her 4 years ago. I‚Äôm now 28 & get told I look like I‚Äôm underage all the time. Ignore those guys. They‚Äôre most likely jealous. Your future self will thank you for taking care of your skin! Just an fyi, there is no pointing out skincare flaws, humiliation, or taunting. He complains that he has acne or his hands are dry and cracked. I‚Äôll tell him what he should do and he will do it for three days until he gets tired of it. His ‚Äúissues‚Äù are my issues when I can tell his confidence is affected. Hmm yeah maybe it‚Äôs my other products messing with it. I‚Äôll give it another shot since I got a new toner today I‚Äôm having the same issue. Definitely has to have nothing under it and have to really rub it to absorb otherwise it‚Äôs all white and patchy. [deleted] Thanks for the tip! I noticed they're the cheapest in my town for the other moisturizers by Cerave That‚Äôs interesting. I pretty much use one product for cleaning and moisturizing‚Äî squalane oil made from olive oil. Will occasionally do a mask or use aloe Vera or witch hazel or this stuff I have called thyme out but every night and every morning I slather on the oil. Oh no, I understand that! I was just so disappointed that it didn‚Äôt work for me. Lol. I‚Äôm happy it works for others! Didn‚Äôt mean to sound angry lol. I was just surprised! :) Oh no! What do you use now? Wow. That‚Äôs my main problem. I developed eczema on my face a few years ago and it was triggered by citrus. But when it was bad, lots of products irritated my skin so that‚Äôs when I switched to cleansing and moisturizing with just squalane oil (made from olive oil) and my eczema pretty much went away. Thank you!! Wear burqa. :p Hi! You're missing the short reviews for each product. Right now they are more explaining where they go in your routine, which aren't really reviews. I would just elaborate on each product.

I've re-approved your post for now, but if you would add those to your post/top comment that would be great. :) Thank you! [removed] You are so sad. I'm sorry you have to come into a skincare post to attempt to get some validation. I hope you find the help you need. Just so you know, I'm a meteorologist, I don't bomb anyone.

If you'd like to know more, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_1._be_kind_and_respectful.). Ok cool! Hope the deployment is easy for y‚Äôall! There‚Äôs one sunscreen La Roche Posay that‚Äôs 70fps. It lasts longer in the skin, you can sweat and it‚Äôs against sun/dust/pollution (all poisons to your skin and all things you‚Äôll deal with when deployed). Not that expensive. I think you should add that to your kit. :) All the sunscreen all the time! So many vets have melanoma and it‚Äôs one of the most deadly cancers. Attack your buddies with it. Keep reapplying regularly. It‚Äôs a shame to see our toughest taken out because sunscreen is seen as a gendered product. Yes. From what I understand you take your burn time (10-20 min depending on your skin-I‚Äôm about 14 min) and multiply it by the SPF. 

So let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 15 min x SPF 30 = 450 min = 7 hours. So if OP is outside most of the day, he will definitely need to reapply. 

BUT this also doesn‚Äôt take into the account that the sunscreen layer can be messed up by sweat, water, etc. Considering OP is in the military, I imagine there will be some sweating. I‚Äôd probably aim to reapply every 3-4 hours, if possible. Sorry yes, renewing serum. I've since edited my comments. Exactly! Also, I saw a face/hair/body wash for men and it was horrible omg. Since you're 16 you probably don't need retinol. You don't need every gimmick or every active ingredient out there, you need a few good products that suit YOUR specific needs. If you have issues with pimples maybe start off with a gentle exfoliant like salicylic acid. Although BE WARNED if you do start using actives like BHAs (salicylic acid) or AHAs (glycolic, lactic acid) or retinol you will need to wear sunscreen every day as they make your skin more sensitive to the sun. The most important and effective product that you can and definitely should add to your routine is sunscreen. I've read that about 90% of skin aging is from UVA/UVB exposure. So, sunscreen every day. Eyy 16 gang. Don‚Äôt start with retinol, the results can be great but it‚Äôs not something to start with. I also haven‚Äôt used it much yet to see that many results but my sister has used isotretinoin (much much stronger form of retinol basically) and her skin is phenomenal now. I use retinol because my skin is constantly oily and I have some scarring I want to get rid of.

What‚Äôs your skin type? Oily, acne prone, dry, oily t-zone, sensitive, etc? It‚Äôs really easy to ignore them tbh, when they chant the n word while being white you realize that their brains aren‚Äôt functioning at 100% anyways. And it‚Äôs not all of them, just like 50%. But my class is super small so that‚Äôs only like 5 ppl Thanks! :) Especially me ;) I definitely am! Some of them are fine, most of them aren‚Äôt. But I am really scared because I suddenly have wrinkles under my eyes??? So that‚Äôs fun, but I also get like max 7 hours of sleep on a weekday so maybe that‚Äôs it. Not authorized in uniform :P Thank you! I will. I'm on my stupid phone and it's being difficult. Once I get on a computer I'll edit it and be more thorough! I can't answer that. I'm not Army, I'm Air Force. I just do my job, which is forecasting weather. Even still, a skincare thread is not the place for these comments. I said what I said Really though, thank you both for your service! It means a whole lot to most of us! how does that boot taste? Is it a nice tongue exfoliant? I‚Äôd heard so many good things about the LRP and tried it repeatedly. Each time I‚Äôd have breakouts witching 4-7 days of use. Sadness. 

I do love me some CeraVe, but am not thrilled about their AM moisturizer. Dunno why exactly: it burns if it gets in my eyes and it just feels a bit heavy on my face... I still keep using it, but I am actively looking for alternatives. I'll look into it, thanks! I work in an office fortunately. So I am really not in the sun any more than anyone else with an office job. I do know I should still use sunscreen more though. And in general, it is a good idea to re-apply sunscreen every two hours regardless of the Spf lol. Can you recommend any solid exfoliants? I know chemical exfoliants are the way to go over harsh facial scrubs with the plastic microbeads but other than that, I have no idea. Isotretinoin (also known as accutane), while it does eliminate most (if not all) acne, it should typically only be considered as a last resort. Mainly for those with severe cystic acne. It's around a half year of treatment, and the side effects are no joke. I have an oily t-zone and normal to dry skin everywhere else. I have a few pimples and some small scars, which are my primary concerns. My acne was never bad and my derm started me on epiduo (the active component is adapalene, which is a mild retinoid) when I was 16. It worked for me. The best thing anyone can do is start with at least a derm consult. Topical retinoids are actually commonly the first line treatment for mild - mod acne, along with benzoyl peroxide. Wow they sound like pieces of work. Good on you for realising that's not something to aspire to though. We need more people like you. I had faint lines around my eyes, on my forehead, & a little around my mouth at 18 to 26. I also got very little sleep in college so I‚Äôm sure that made it worse. I found a good eye cream & used a retinoid my skin likes. After a while the lines have all disappeared :) He's trolling you lol There should always be a place and time to adres inhuman actions Try Cerave Ultra Light moisturizer with spf 30. The tube is annoying af but it‚Äôs very light and dries down matte. I break out all the time from sunscreens too. But I found one by ISDIN that hasn't made me break out and it has high protection. Look for a sunscreen that is more cream based instead of oily, that can help. Did you wash it off every day? Cause if you don‚Äôt, they clog your pores and then your skin reacts badly. Or maybe you just got allergy to some of it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Sorry for your rare bad experience. A lot of people love the Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA, Paula's Choice also does a gentler 1% one in the Calm line. Downside is they're all quite pricey. Pretty sure The Ordinary also does some exfoliants although I haven't tried them personally. Pixie Glow Tonic is another one I've seen mentioned around. 

If you look in the sidebar theres a whole section for AHAs and BHAs that also feature product recommendations. Just remember to take it easy and not go on a shopping spree buying 10 different products at once, you'd probably end up doing more harm than good. I don‚Äôt know, I kind of think it depends on the situation. I did accutane and it wasn‚Äôt a last resort for me. I didn‚Äôt have severe or cystic acne, I had stubborn but fairly mild acne. I got tired of it not going away completely so my derm suggested accutane. I had similar thoughts (that it‚Äôs a last resort, that my acne wasn‚Äôt bad enough), but my derm told me that it isn‚Äôt just for horrible acne, it‚Äôs for people who want their acne gone, and gone for years. I did a pretty low dose for five months and I‚Äôve had clear skin since. Yeah of course, the side effects are no joke (and so are the birth issues too, she has to get monthly blood tests for her liver as well) and she did have severe cystic acne, which is why she went on it. But yeah for her it‚Äôs definitely a last resort. Given the fact that you have few pimples yet your skin is dry, I would only recommend either a cleanser with 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide or 2% Salicylic Acid (both are exfoliants). Don't use a separate acid or Benzoyl peroxide gel since that would only increase your DRY skin irritation and exacerbates scarring.
Use a thick, thick, thick moisturizer that doesn't have fragrance and bath your whole face in it. Mainly just take the advice everyone else has given. You can use things like salicylic acid to combat acne, and if you want to prevent oil I find that the Ordinary‚Äôs azelaic acid is super good at keeping down oil during the day. Your scars will fade with time and with a regular routine your pimples should diminish a bit, but you‚Äôll need to test to see what works for you. (The Ordinary is quite cheap and let‚Äôs you affordably try out actives, I recommend them for things like acid and stuff) That‚Äôs great to hear! Thanks for easing my fear lol, I was worried I‚Äôd overdone it and permanently damaged my skin. edit* Mod removed your comments above so I'm just going to stop responding to you What cleaners have this? Would Cerave be a good option? I live somewhere super dry and have similar skin as described above. Thank you!! I knew nothing about skincare until relatively recently after finding this sub. If you‚Äôre interested I have only ever used the LilyAna Naturals eye cream & it worked great for me. It‚Äôs not the cheapest at $20 on amazon but it lasts several months because you need so little. You‚Äôll just want to make sure none of the ingredients conflict with your regimen. It has Vitamin C & I‚Äôve had some actives react poorly with products that have it. Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely check it out, my current moisturizer is not good on my eyes, that‚Äôs for sure. $20 isn‚Äôt that bad, but I live in Europe now so I‚Äôm going to have to see. :) **Hi everyone!

(No, you should be getting yourself out in a fire! I burnt my kitchen down, I know these things. But....so handy, grab and go..) Love the shelf; dust just gets on my nerves. 

Did you like the melano cc cream? Is that vitamin c? Where did you purchase it? That Fresh Vitamin spray is one of my favorite products ever! I spray it on after my concealer and powder products so they don't look powdery. It feels so good and I love how it smells. **Dry/normal skin type. In the perpetual quest to shrink my pores and stop aging.**

**Current Routine:**

* \[PM\] Klairs Supple Preparation Toner (pH adjusting toner after shower)
* \[AM/PM\] Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner (pH adjusting + moisturizing toner)
* \[AM/PM\] Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (essence/moisture)
* \[PM\] Curology Custom Formula (tretinoin + azelaic acid + niacinamide)
* \[AM/PM\] innisfree Jeju Cherry Blossom Dewy Glow Jelly Cream (light moisturizer)
* \[AM/PM\] belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb (thicker moisturizer)
* \[AM/PM\] The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane (light occlusive)
* \[AM\] Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ 2019 Edition (sunscreen)
* \[PM\] LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask
* \[whenever\] Fresh Vitamin Nectar Antioxidant Face Mist
   * smells like freshly cut oranges and it's just a nice refreshing mist to have on deck

**Using Occasionally:**

* \[PM\] The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil
   * I'll use this as a final occlusive later if my skin is super dry and squalane won't cut it that day
* \[AM/PM\] belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb (sample size)
   * I apply all my products close enough to my eyes that I only use this on occasion when allergies are hitting me really badly
* \[AM\] Biossance Squalane + Viamin C Rose Oil (sample size)
   * Currently comparing it to The Ordinary's Squalane to see if it's worth the price. So far, not really.
* \[AM/PM\] belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb
   * I use this on my rare oily days or in very hot weather. Most days I opt for The True Cream from belif since it's thicker
* \[PM\] Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask
   * Sleeping mask that I'e seen good results with, but I'm too lazy to wait most nights for my skincare to soak in more before applying this. It's fairly new to me currently so hopefully I'll use it more soon when colder weather hits

**In Hibernation:**

* \[AM\] Melano CC Vitamin C Moisturizing Cream
   * I'm waiting for my skin to adjust to my higher concentration of tretinoin with Curology before I use this again.
* \[AM/PM\] Etude House SoonJung 10 Free Moist Emulsion (light moisturizer) and Etude House SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream (thicker moisturizer)
   * I've since replaced these with the innisfree dewy jelly cream and belif creams (I know they're not the same). I keep them around for breakout days which are thankfully rare
* \[??\] Then I Met You Honey Dew Lip Mask
   * What a terrible product compared to the LANEIGE. I bought this because it does a similar thing for lips and it has an applicator, but it's such a terrible product. It's SO drying. I just bought this a couple weeks ago and likely will be trashing it

**The Shelf:** [Dustproof Makeup Display Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088HBK8Q9). It's not currently available but there are so many similar ones. I liked this particular one for the clear drawers that remind me to try all the damn samples I accumulate. Ah, this is in my taobao shopping cart That is so cute! I have a similar one- [Skincare organizer ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TZM8HBJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_2y-BFbMTY89ZZ) that my daughter got me for Christmas last year and it's AMAZING!!! It's a lot bigger than it appears, I do ipsy glam bag and glam bag plus and it holds everything. My tallest bottle doesn't even come close to hitting the highest point. It opens from both sides which is nice because I have a lot of smaller products and can't see them as well. It'd be cool if it had a rotating base. 

There are different types of these all over Amazon, at least three used to be. This one hasn't been available the last two times I have looked.

 I have a [Makeup organizer ](https://www.amazon.com/Felicite-Home-Acrylic-Cosmetic-Organizer/dp/B073WW52S6/ref=mp_s_a_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=clear%2Bmakeup%2Borganizer&qid=1601169753&sprefix=Makup%2Bor&sr=8-14&th=1&psc=1) similar to this one but it's tinted purple. Having these two organizers made things easier and are aesthetically pleasing. If you're in Canada, you can get a similar make-up organizer from here https://pinknblossom.com/product/the-living-makeup-organizer/ Do you have the link for the product? I‚Äôve been looking for something like this!!! Can‚Äôt stand when my products get dusty It‚Äôs a caboodle! Love it How do you find the pyunkang yul essence? I‚Äôve been considering buying it but don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it I fully read this as ‚ÄúDupe-Proof...‚Äù and was thinking ‚ÄúHow does it work? Can it sense the dupes?‚Äù And cat proof!! what‚Äôre your results w the snail mucin? i found it irritating for some reason and had to return it! What‚Äôs the texture of your laneige lip sleeping mask? I‚Äôm worried mine‚Äôs a rip off because I got it from ebay. I see a lot of people saying it‚Äôs basically like vaseline but mine feels more like melted butter on my lips? Shout out to curology!!! Saved my skin OOOOH! this is SO CUTE!!! thanks for sharing, now I need to get one Do you like the pyungkang yul essence better for hydration and soothing than a toner like Klairs Supple Preparation? Can you tell me more about the eye bomb and how it helps with your allergies? Thanks! Hey! So I started a new skincare routine 28 days ago with Cerave (normal to oil) cleanse. My skin is purging (I think) I just want to know If that‚Äôs normal and should I hold for a couple more months to see results Love it! My spinning organiser gets so dusty & never cleans up as I‚Äôd hope. Here‚Äôs a starting point for any Brits wanting one: MEIZHEN Makeup Organizer https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B087RKV4T5/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_YVhCFbTZE9PB8 I hope I can find one without using Amazon though! I just bought one of these too! So sick of having to dust off all my stuff haha. I would probably leave it open all the time, or break it in my haste :p Cute! [deleted] Where did you buy this? Looks really nice Does anyone have a link to one that‚Äôs in stock and they actually have tried and like? I saw these on Etsy and thought about getting one myself. Do you like it? wow wow wow new tech for sure klairs and cosrx ftw! I want one of these so badly, but they're so expensive, and I heard they always arrived damaged. I bought something like this for my makeup brushes! Nice Beautiful solution for compact living. Also very practical to move around or keep dust free. Im assuming you also buy skin care products from yesstyle? [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088HBK8Q9](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088HBK8Q9)

it's not available anymore tho (even tho i just got it this week!). i paid a little over $40 for it! there seem to be a ton of similar products still available. i was actually looking for one of those lazy susan towers and came across these genius dustproof cases and i knew i had to have one

EDIT to add that the most important point for me was how tall the top shelf was. Most are surprisingly short (since they're designed for makeup) If you search dust proof organiser on ebay lots of cheaper options come up that are similar designs. I, too, need this information :) Yes it does have a handle!! Hopefully never need to use it with such urgency tho üòÖ Your username tho! Ahh a fellow Californian I see! I actually got the Melano CC in Japan and realized I would have preferred the Melano CC essence, which is more watery. I have a lot of heavier moisturizers already in my routine so I didn't see the same benefits others usually do in terms of brightening. To be fair, I only used it for a few weeks before I ended up ditching it to start using tretinoin. I've heard nothing but great things and it's very cheap even on Amazon, yessstyle, etc. so I'd still recommend it to someone over pricier vitamin c products. I plan on giving it another try once my face is more used to tret, but I may end up just getting the essence for my whole face and using the cream only for specific spots I want to lighten. i highly doubt your skin can absorb half of these. so excessive. No exfoliation? (Aside from tretinoin over time) I think they sell ones like this on Amazon too! It‚Äôs probably from Amazon or Wish. I was looking for it. I love it and have repurchased several times already. I think it's a little duplicative if you already have a great hydrating toner, but if you don't-- I really recommend it. Also its pH is 4-5 which is great. It has minimal ingredients and great slip. I find it absorbs into my skin well and is really soothing, which is great for my tret face. I don't think it does anything groundbreaking, but it supplies me with a nice transitional layer of moisturizer while I wait to apply my tret. If it's a really dry day I use the innisfree before tret too, but usually I use tret right after the snail has soaked in a bit and then continue with the rest of my routine. I think it just helps me not dry out and get itchy while I wait. No irritation for me luckily FYI some people with dust mite allergies are also allergic to snail and therefore find snail mucin irritating, not sure if that is the case with you! Same! Mine is definitely thicker like Vaseline, got it from Sephora Mine is like a less sticky Vaseline/Aquaphor. It can become a bit melted on really hot days, but in general it should be fairly thick like Vaseline I find it depends on which "flavour" you have. I bought both the vanilla and original from Sephora and I find the original does go on more like a Vaseline consistency while the vanilla one feels less thick on my lips Happy cake day!! Yeah 100%. The Klairs I apply right after getting out of the shower with a cotton pad so I can get any residual stuff off my face and it resets my pH (the water where I live is very alkaline). I don't find it particularly hydrating or soothing; it just has a good pH and is thin enough to be used for the purpose I use it for. The Pyunkang Yul is the first thing I use that actually hydrates and soothes my face and it's much more viscous. It truly is more like an essence/serum than a traditional toner When my seasonal allergies are acting up my eyes get dry and itchy and I definitely rub them more than I should. The belif eye bomb is really hydrating and soothing which helps combat some of that dryness/irritation. As an added bonus that also helps plump some fine lines. I don't think it does much for dark circles but that's often genetic and hard to combat.

This is also the only eye cream I've used that doesn't give me milia but it actually hydrating. The Sana Nameraka Honpo Isoflavone Eye Cream, innisfree Jeju Orchid Eye Cream, CeraVe Eye Repair Cream, etc. all gave me milia.

I actually did enjoy the Versed Vacation Eyes Brightening Eye Gel and found it did a small amount of work on dark circles, and while it was soothing it was not very hydrating. So definitely the belif is better as a thick eye cream since dryness is a perpetual concern of mine. I used to use the CeraVe hydrating cleanser! They have a few kinds I think, so it likely depends on which one. For example, if you're using the foaming one, it might be too drying and your skin could be breaking out because it doesn't have the balance of moisture it needs to maintain a healthy barrier. If you're using the SA one (which I use on occasion) daily, it might be over-exfoliation causing irritation. If you're using the hydrating one daily, I wouldn't expect purging unless maybe it's not as cleansing as what you used before and you're not getting makeup/sunscreen/dead skin/sebum off your face in adequate levels. That's all a guess tho and I'm definitely not a dermatologist so take what I say with a grain of salt üòÖ You will looooove it ü§ó Yeah it really does work! For me, I'm just doing it because I'm willing to pay $20/month to avoid having to go in person to a doctor to continue getting my tretinoin prescription refilled/adjusted. I actually don't think I benefit from it nearly as much as most people since it's geared more toward people with acne, but I think that (almost) everyone can benefit from using tretinoin and having an online dermatologist is incredibly convenient. Also because their base formulation is made for people with acne you aren't getting your tretinoin with a highly comedogenic carrier like most generic prescriptions have. From my experience, if you go to your primary doctor and ask for Retin-A or tretinoin they will write you a prescription. I've been on it for 6 years with no probably refilling it or moving up to a higher concentration. If you can go that route curology isn't necessary I love it. I am a highly disorganized person and it forces me to keep things in one place and away from dust/being knocked off the table [deleted] Omg I was looking on Amazon the other day and considered getting this! Maybe I actually will now. If anyone is looking for a similar enclosed storage option, the one I use is still available from Amazon:

[https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B084MMQ311/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B084MMQ311/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

It's very tall inside. I have the lazy Susan tower and it gets so grimy and hard to clean. This is awesome Can I ask why you aren‚Äôt using the cc cream alongside tret? I‚Äôve heard that they can work well in conjunction with each other as long as you‚Äôre staggering when you use them. I‚Äôm thinking of picking it up, so just curious üòä Ah yeah these are just my ‚Äúdry‚Äù products. I use the Skinfood Black Sugar Wash Off Mask and Neogen Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Pads in Wine in the shower. The latter I use like once a week and the former maybe a few times a week‚Äî just whenever I feel like it. When my skin is suuuuuper peely from the tret I‚Äôll substitute my regular cleanser with the CeraVe SA Cleanser to slough off some of the dead skin.

I‚Äôm looking into incorporating my Paula‚Äôs Choice BHA or some type of peel to help clear the dead skin/sebum in my pores but I‚Äôm honestly still transitioning to a recent tret % increase. If you have any suggestions on easy-to-incorporate exfoliation with tret I‚Äôm all ears!! üòÖ that‚Äôs a smart way to use it! i think maybe it was too thick/sticky for me or something. i switched to a humectant toner and it seems to be less finnicky. its also really hot where i live that‚Äôs maybe this issue. Is Laneige worth it? Do you like it? I've heard mixed reviews How cool!!! Thank you!!!! Ooh that makes so much sense! Thank you for explaining! I haven‚Äôt worn make up since I started the routine. It‚Äôs verve cleanser, heritage rose water toner, corsx snail muchin, then Aveeno daily moisturizer and I have oily skin. Not much has changed, so I been debating weather or not to stick with our let it go before it gets worse These are all Canada

I also stumbled across this one from Target

https://www.target.com/p/mdesign-decorative-bathroom-vanity-makeup-storage-organizers-set-of-2-marble/-/A-79722649

Hope this helps! It says it‚Äôs not in stock until October 27th. üòü that‚Äôs amazing, too bad i‚Äôm broke lol. my current set up is nice but now i have too much stuff to fit all of it. Yep I have a tower for my makeup and it's always dusty and a pain to clean. I need one of these for makeup too! A lot of people recommend that you stop all actives prior to starting tret and then slowly reintroduce them once you're retinized. Yep what others said! I'm fighting the urge to add more actives until I can handle my tretinoin every night or at least with less irritation (I'm currently on every other night with lots of flaking) Not the previous commenter, but I have a similar skin type (and also use a lot of the same products you do!) and I LOVE the PC 2% BHA. I use it 3-4 times a week in the am, on days when I use a Vit C serum. I‚Äôve probably had it in my routine to some degree or another for 10(+/-) years now (yes, I‚Äôm old by Reddit standards!) I wouldn‚Äôt be without it. It‚Äôs gentle yet effective. I have used the Neogen peel pads, too, but they were a little too ‚Äúphysical‚Äù for my skin. If I‚Äôm using a peel pad, it‚Äôs the Dr Dennis Gross regular strength Alpha Beta Peel Pads. They are pricey, but I find with using the BHA ~3x/week, I can just use the Dr Gross once a week and it‚Äôs about perfect. I‚Äôll sometimes throw in the Ordinary AHA/BHA peel (usually once every 1-2 weeks). Hope that helps! Yeah honestly I think it performs so much more like a moisturizer than an essence or toner. It's too thick to be used in that part of one's routine unless you wait several minutes, which I definitely wouldn't do if tret didn't force me to. I'm glad you found a humectant toner that is easier to work with in that part of your routine! It‚Äôs the only thing that keeps my lips from drying out at night! Also it tastes good as opposed to something like Aquaphor so it‚Äôs an easy thing to add to your routine since you‚Äôre incentivized to wear it I use it at night in the winter and it's great for me Just piping in here that Mamonde lip sleeping mask is awesome and I think a few dollars cheaper than Laneige. That makes sense. Thanks for the answer! Out of curiosity, have you tried an AHA as well? It's interesting to hear from someone with a similar skin type using these products! Generally all the reviews I've found are for oily skin types. I found the PC BHA to burn when using it every other day, but maybe 3x per week is better ü§î Thanks for the ideas! I have tried samples and enjoy it, but I prefer the liquid BHA texture. It is easier for me to incorporate into my routine, over the gel or lotion textures available in the AHA. I use Sunday Riley Good Genes or Farmacy Honeymoon Glow a couple of times a week in the PM, so I get AHA in those products. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt be more helpful! Yes, I think 3x/week is my happy spot, so I just stick with it. With my skin being dry and a little sensitive, I‚Äôve learned not to push it too much with the actives, and any time I notice increased sensitivity, redness or flaking, I back off for a day or two. I‚Äôve learned the hard way not to try to ‚Äúpush through‚Äù with things! ;) Not at all, you've been hugely helpful! I hope it's alright to ask a few more questions regarding exfoliators!

I've actually been considering something like Good Genes for a while, so if you're open to it, could you speak more about Good Genes? I'd love to hear your thoughts on Farmacy's Honeymoon Glow as well!

As a standalone question, how do you decide which to use, Good Genes or the Honeymoon Glow, on a given night? And how do you incorporate the AHA with the BHA?

With regards to exfoliators overall, how did you go about introducing them into your routine? Things like determining the frequency, when to use them (AM vs. PM), etc.? When you first started, did you ever experience over-exfoliated skin or a broken moisture barrier? Any advice for those such as myself who have yet to use an exfoliator, but are on the precipice of adding one?

Also, if you're open to it, could you share your routine? Given that you use exfoliators and vitamin C, both of which are products that I'm hoping to incorporate in the future, I think it would be a huge help to see how others are incorporating them (e.g., ensuring certain ingredients aren't being mixed). I don‚Äôt mind at all! 

I finally bit the bullet on GG a couple of years ago. It took some convincing because of the price, but it‚Äôs an absolute HG product for me. It just makes my skin so smooth, clear, bright and plump, and I love the way it looks the next morning. I purchased the Honeymoon Glow after reading reviews and seeing people say it was a ‚Äúdupe‚Äù for GG. It was a really nice product, and if I didn‚Äôt have and love GG, I would still be happy with using it, but it just didn‚Äôt work as well for my skin. I didn‚Äôt notice the smoothness or brightness to my skin quite as much, and it almost seemed like it was a touch more harsh on my skin. It has a higher percentage of acids in it, so that‚Äôs not surprising, but I think that maybe the glycolic PLUS lactic in the H Glow was too much. If I only used it once or twice a week, I was fine. Regarding how I incorporate it ‚Äî I also use rx Retin-A, as prescribed by my derm, so I alternate nights on that. My skin can‚Äôt handle either product every night, so it kind of works out really well for me to alternate the two! If I notice my skin getting a little too dry, flaky or sensitive, I just skip a night or two. :)

As for my routine ...... I have dry-normal, slightly sensitive skin. Issues are acne (usually hormonal but mild, thanks in part to BC) dryness, and general anti-aging (I‚Äôve probably got a solid decade - probably two - on the average Redditor). 

In the AM I cleanse with a gentle cleanser, apply the PC BHA, then Vit C serum, hydrating serum, moisturizer mixed with 1-2 drops of oil, then SPF face and SPF eye (Colorescience). 

PM is oil or balm cleanser, gentle cleanser, Retin-A OR GG (alternating nights), hydrating mist, hydrating serum (sometimes), moisturizer, oil and sometimes a heavier occlusive on top. 

Of course I have other little things I do here and there. The Ordinary AHA/BHA peel once a week or every other week. Maybe the Dr Gross peel pads once a week in the am in place of the PC BHA. I use a NuFace almost every morning, as well as the Light Salon Boost LED light every morning, and plenty of masks (usually hydrating). 

Is a routine like mine necessary? Absolutely not! And I‚Äôm sure plenty of people would think my routine is too extensive, but I really enjoy my skincare and the ritual and routine of it all.  I believe I look good (better than average? üòÇ) for my age, so at least it‚Äôs working??

Hope I addressed all of the questions you asked and provided a little more insight. :) This is a great reply, and is absolutely insightful! I hope you don't mind if I ask a few more questions though!

This may be a weird question, but given the price of GG, do you ever try to find it on sale or discount or whatnot, and if so, what's your usual place to go? 

When you first started with GG, how did you go about introducing it into your routine? Was it your first AHA, or were there others that you had used, and you had built up a tolerance such that using GG wasn't a shock to your skin's system?

I only ask about introducing it because while AHAs and BHAs seem *super* useful, I'm a bit scared to use them because of the risk of over-exfoliation, y'know? I will admit, for at least 4 or 5 years, I used [Clean&Clear's SA astringent](https://www.cleanandclear.com/astringents-toners/essentials-deep-cleaning-astringent#ingredients) and suffered no real issues, so hopefully that's at least a sign that I can take *some* amount of exfoliation, haha.

> I also use rx Retin-A, as prescribed by my derm, so I alternate nights on that. My skin can‚Äôt handle either product every night, so it kind of works out really well for me to alternate the two! If I notice my skin getting a little too dry, flaky or sensitive, I just skip a night or two. :)

When you do notice your skin getting dry, flaky, or sensitive, how do you go about addressing that? Do you change anything in your routine?

As a standalone question in regards to Retin-A, when you first started using it, how did you go about ensuring your skin could reasonably acclimate to it? I know Retin-A (same thing as tret, I think?) can result in some pretty harsh drying at first in the name of anti-aging and anti-acne, so if I was to go on that, I want to be as prepared as possible, haha.

> As for my routine ...... I have dry-normal, slightly sensitive skin. Issues are acne (usually hormonal but mild, thanks in part to BC) dryness, and general anti-aging (I‚Äôve probably got a solid decade - probably two - on the average Redditor).

Kind of curious, but what specifically do you use for anti-aging? I've been trying to find products that help with it, just to be aware of them, so that once my routine is at the point where other issues are taken care of (for me, trying to control my t-zone since it's oily, reduction of a few closed comedones, and prevention of acne breakouts), I can incorporate something specifically for anti-aging.

Beyond Retin-A, do you use anything to help with your acne, such as spot treatment creams or whatnot? I think I'd classify myself as having a mild case of acne as well, as I only get acne in singles and only a few at a time across my t-zone (since it's fairly oily on my forehead, less so my nose).

> In the AM I cleanse with a gentle cleanser, apply the PC BHA, then Vit C serum, hydrating serum, moisturizer mixed with 1-2 drops of oil, then SPF face and SPF eye (Colorescience).

With regards to adding oil to your moisturizer, how do you go about doing that? Do you just take some moisturizer on your hands, add in a couple drops of oil, and then apply? I realize this sounds quite silly to ask, but for some reason I'm having a spot of trouble picturing how to mix the two, haha.

Do you personally find that using an SPF for your eyes specifically helps out? I've read that eye-related creams and whatnot are somewhat suspicious in their ability to make a substantial difference in comparison to general face creams, y'know? Although, the flipside to that is that the eye area is much more sensitive, so on paper it would make sense that eye creams serve a unique purpose.

Also, with regards to using the BHA and the Vitamin C serum: On days when you don't use them, do you use anything instead?

> PM is oil or balm cleanser, gentle cleanser, Retin-A OR GG (alternating nights), hydrating mist, hydrating serum (sometimes), moisturizer, oil and sometimes a heavier occlusive on top.

If you're cool with it, could you name the products (or oil, in the casse of the AM) specifically? I hope I'm not asking too much! I'm just honestly super curious and I think you have a routine (by order, at least) that I hope to get to one day (e.g., using vitamin C, AHA, BHA, trying to prevent anti-aging). 

> Is a routine like mine necessary? Absolutely not! And I‚Äôm sure plenty of people would think my routine is too extensive, but I really enjoy my skincare and the ritual and routine of it all. I believe I look good (better than average? üòÇ) for my age, so at least it‚Äôs working??

I mean /r/asianbeauty would probably argue that your routine is just right, haha. And I'm inclined to agree! Like yeah there are people whose routines are water and sunscreen, but I mean, there's a reason why some routines are as involved as they are. Not like we'd use more than two products if there weren't benefits to be gained, y'know?

And 100% AGREE to enjoying the ritual of it all; that, and taking peace in knowing that each product is helping in some capacity. I will say, I'm still super early on in my skincare career (22 year old guy, only really started paying attention and forgoing that Clean&Clear stuff in May of this year), but I've really enjoyed learning all about skincare, despite the overwhelmingness  that seems to come with it all, haha. >This may be a weird question, but given the price of GG, do you ever try to find it on sale or discount or whatnot, and if so, what's your usual place to go?

I am able to find it on sale some, which is usually when I purchase it. Skinstore, Dermstore, Ulta, Sephora, etc will sometimes do 20-25% off. I have also seen SR on Good Morning America Deals before at 50% off, which is an amazing deal!

>When you first started with GG, how did you go about introducing it into your routine? Was it your first AHA, or were there others that you had used, and you had built up a tolerance such that using GG wasn't a shock to your skin's system?

It wasn't the first AHA I had used. I had tried others along the way (please don't ask me to remember that far back! :)), as well as the Dr. Gross Alpha Beta Peel Pads. Although my skin is a little sensitive, I've generally had pretty good luck with acids. I've always been pretty guarded and mindful when introducing them, which helps. When I first started using it, I only used it once a week for a week or two, then went to two nights, and now up to three.

>When you do notice your skin getting dry, flaky, or sensitive, how do you go about addressing that? Do you change anything in your routine?

I back off of actives and baby it. :) I usually go to a gentle cleanser and allllll the moisture and hydration. Soothing, hydrating masks. Then I ease back into my actives and won't do more than one a day for a few days, until my skin is normalized and hydrated.

>As a standalone question in regards to Retin-A, when you first started using it, how did you go about ensuring your skin could reasonably acclimate to it? I know Retin-A (same thing as tret, I think?) can result in some pretty harsh drying at first in the name of anti-aging and anti-acne, so if I was to go on that, I want to be as prepared as possible, haha.

Well, I first started using Retin-A/tret back in college (so a *very* long time ago), and my skin was more oily than it is now, and more resistant. I was prescribed it for my acne, and it helped amazingly. There are a few things you can do with RA to ease into it and combat the flakes and dryness. You can put down a layer of moisturizer before applying the RA as a sort of "buffer", almost diluting it, in a way. Also, start with only one night a week for a few weeks, then two nights (not in a row) for a few weeks, and move on from there. Many people are able to use it every night, and if I really wanted to, I probably could, but since I've had such good results with alternating that and my acid products, I just stick with it. My skin is happy and I don't have the dryness and flaking or messing up my moisture barrier or acid mantle.

>Kind of curious, but what specifically do you use for anti-aging? I've been trying to find products that help with it, just to be aware of them, so that once my routine is at the point where other issues are taken care of (for me, trying to control my t-zone since it's oily, reduction of a few closed comedones, and prevention of acne breakouts), I can incorporate something specifically for anti-aging.

Retin-A! It's the gold standard for anti-aging. I was prescribed it for my acne specifically, and it definitely helps with that, but the added anti-aging benefits are equally important, for me. Also, SPF all day every day. Another scientifically proven product to combat aging (and skin cancer). For me, moisture is also very important. When my skin starts to get dry or dehydrated, your girl starts looking old(er). I find that plump, hydrated juicy skin does wonders! 

>Beyond Retin-A, do you use anything to help with your acne, such as spot treatment creams or whatnot? I think I'd classify myself as having a mild case of acne as well, as I only get acne in singles and only a few at a time across my t-zone (since it's fairly oily on my forehead, less so my nose).

Acne patches. Oh my goodness, I discovered these from /r/asianbeauty back in the day, and they are one of my favorite things ever. Being as I have more dry skin, a lot of spot treatments combat the acne, but also leave the skin around the cc dry, red and irritated. So pimple patches it is! I do use the PTR Acne Clearing Gel on occasion, and it is very nice. My husband has more oily skin and uses and loves it for any acne spots he has. It doesn't dry my skin out as much as many other acne products.

>With regards to adding oil to your moisturizer, how do you go about doing that? Do you just take some moisturizer on your hands, add in a couple drops of oil, and then apply? I realize this sounds quite silly to ask, but for some reason I'm having a spot of trouble picturing how to mix the two, haha.

Yes, I just put a dollop of moisturizer on my (clean) fingers and drop a couple of drops of oil on it, mix it up, and apply! (Not a silly question, btw)

>Do you personally find that using an SPF for your eyes specifically helps out? I've read that eye-related creams and whatnot are somewhat suspicious in their ability to make a substantial difference in comparison to general face creams, y'know? Although, the flipside to that is that the eye area is much more sensitive, so on paper it would make sense that eye creams serve a unique purpose.

I do use an AM eye gel (Jordan Samuel Performance Eye Gel - it is amazing, and absolutely an HG product for me, sorry I forgot it previously!) and then apply the Colorescience on top of that. I don't use an eye product in the PM. I like that the Colorescience has a tint to it, so on days when I just wear tinted SPF and that, I still feel good about my skin and undereye area. I also appreciate that it has SPF in it. I don't really like putting most SPF products up that far, so I really love the Colorescience product. I don't buy into people needing eye creams. I just like the SPF and color correction aspects of the Colorscience, and the Jordan Samuel has an awesome texture that doesn't make any of my undereye makeup products pill or ball up. 

>If you're cool with it, could you name the products (or oil, in the casse of the AM) specifically? I hope I'm not asking too much! I'm just honestly super curious and I think you have a routine (by order, at least) that I hope to get to one day (e.g., using vitamin C, AHA, BHA, trying to prevent anti-aging).

Sure: I use CosRx Good Morning cleanser or Krave Matcha Cleanser, MaeLove or Paula's Choice Vit C Serum, PC BHA. For moisturizer I use one of three: Belief Moisture Bomb, Jordan Samuel Performance Cream, or Krave Oat So Simple Moisturizer. All are amazing! For oils, I'm currently using the DermaE Radiant Glow Facial oil, but I usually use Rosehip Seed, Jojoba or Sweet Almond. Something simple! SPF is usually Paula's Choice Super-Light Wrinkle Defense or the Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen SPF 50. I've also used Elta MD in the past with great success.

Yes, I fell down the Asian Beauty rabbit hole several years ago and tried a ton of AB products, some of which I still use in my routine here and there! AB products are definitely unique and so many are ahead of the game. If I use AB products, it's usually a cleanser, moisturizer, essence or mask.

Hope the OP doesn't mind that my comment was so long.... :) And hope I answered your questions! > I am able to find it on sale some, which is usually when I purchase it. Skinstore, Dermstore, Ulta, Sephora, etc will sometimes do 20-25% off. I have also seen SR on Good Morning America Deals before at 50% off, which is an amazing deal!

DANG. Okay, so this may sound silly, but do you have any way of being notified about these sales (especially the GMA Deals one!!)? I know there's Honey and a product can be put on a watchlist, but I'm curious what your methods are for finding *really* good deals like these!

> When I first started using it, I only used it once a week for a week or two, then went to two nights, and now up to three.

Kind of going in tandem with this, as you used it, did you find that your skin overall was improving from using it, and thus felt that you could use it on a more frequent basis? One of my concerns is seeing good results from exfoliation, but then not seeing them days after until another application. In doing so, I fear I would succumb to over-using the exfoliator in the name of trying to get those same results. In other words, do you find that the results were long-term from using it, or mostly only visible the next day?

> I back off of actives and baby it [when skin is dry and flaky]. :) I usually go to a gentle cleanser and allllll the moisture and hydration. Soothing, hydrating masks. Then I ease back into my actives and won't do more than one a day for a few days, until my skin is normalized and hydrated.

Do you think you're at a point where you've sort of "stabilized" in terms of your routine such that you don't encounter dry or flaky skin as often? Or is it just something that sort of *happens* from external factors like weather?

> Well, I first started using Retin-A/tret back in college (so a very long time ago), and my skin was more oily than it is now, and more resistant.

I hope you don't mind if I ask a question or two about this:

With regards to your skin being more oily and resistant then as compared to now, was this change just something that happened naturally over time, or was the introduction of things like tret why your skin changed? In a similar vein, how did you respond (either via changing your routine or otherwise) to those changes? I only ask because I'm a bit spooked that I might develop a routine now that is a bit "intense," such as having exfoliators or tret, and then over time my skin might not take to it.

> re: anti-aging

That all makes sense regarding tret and sunscreen! I'll definitely make further inquiries regarding tret, since right now I'm only using adapelene, so going on tret for both acne and anti-aging seems like a great option!

So if I may ask, what's the purpose then of using the NuFace and the Salon Boost LED Light? Do they serve other purposes?

> MaeLove or Paula's Choice Vit C Serum

How do you determine which you use on a given day? Does it go back to whether or not you're babying your skin, or would vitamin C be out of the equation if your skin was in babying form?

Also, have you tried other vitamin C serums (e.g., more expensive ones like SkinCeuticals, or Asian ones like Melano CC?

> For oils, I'm currently using the DermaE Radiant Glow Facial oil, but I usually use Rosehip Seed, Jojoba or Sweet Almond. Something simple!

If I may ask, what differences have you found by using an oil as compared to when you didn't use to use one? Also, do you have any preferred brands for things like Jojoba or Rosehip? I don't know if there's any real gradient in quality, or if it's all the same, so any retailer of the oil would suffice, y'know?

> Yes, I fell down the Asian Beauty rabbit hole several years ago and tried a ton of AB products, some of which I still use in my routine here and there! AB products are definitely unique and so many are ahead of the game. If I use AB products, it's usually a cleanser, moisturizer, essence or mask.

When you tried a bunch of products out, for those that didn't work for you, what'd you do with them? Did you just give them to friends or something along those lines? I myself don't have a ton of products (yet, but hopefully not too many in the long run), but if/when I do come across products that don't work with my skin, I'm nervous about how to properly dispose of them (especially during these times).

> Hope the OP doesn't mind that my comment was so long.... :) And hope I answered your questions!

Totally fine that it's long, I love long back and forths like these! And you totally answered all of my questions totally and entirely! >DANG. Okay, so this may sound silly, but do you have any way of being notified about these sales (especially the GMA Deals one!!)? I know there's Honey and a product can be put on a watchlist, but I'm curious what your methods are for finding really good deals like these!

I follow beautydealsbff on IG and she posts lots of deals, including the GMA ones. I also subscribed to SkinStore and Dermstore emails, so I receive emails that way, too.

>Kind of going in tandem with this, as you used it, did you find that your skin overall was improving from using it, and thus felt that you could use it on a more frequent basis?

In doing so, I fear I would succumb to over-using the exfoliator in the name of trying to get those same results. In other words, do you find that the results were long-term from using it, or mostly only visible the next day?

I definitely think the results are long-term. Chemical exfoliation will help with wrinkles, brightness and texture, and so obviously continued use will result in continued improvement, at least in my experience. I think the big thing is finding the product(s) that work for you and the amount that you can use them, and don't go overboard from there. I don't "push the limits", especially with acids. I've done that before (not to an extreme degree, but still), and it's not fun to try to bounce back from that.

>Do you think you're at a point where you've sort of "stabilized" in terms of your routine such that you don't encounter dry or flaky skin as often? Or is it just something that sort of happens from external factors like weather?

Definitely! Once I figured out the strength of Retin-A I can tolerate, the exfoliators that work for me, and my "schedule" for applying products, I pretty much just stick with it. If I do notice any changes, I pull back some. It's better to skip a day or two of products and go easy on the actives than to forge ahead with your routine as you know it, with potentially negative results.  The things that change my routine are the weather and sometimes allergens in the air. Usually in the winter, I have to back off of actives a little until my skin gets more acclimated, and with allergies, my skin can get a little irritated, so I'll skip them then, depending on how my skin is doing.

>With regards to your skin being more oily and resistant then as compared to now, was this change just something that happened naturally over time, or was the introduction of things like tret why your skin changed? In a similar vein, how did you respond (either via changing your routine or otherwise) to those changes? I only ask because I'm a bit spooked that I might develop a routine now that is a bit "intense," such as having exfoliators or tret, and then over time my skin might not take to it.

That happened quite a long time ago, so I don't remember the specifics, but I believe it was hormonal in nature. I had started BC for acne and my skin got much more dry. It was never super oily, more oily-normal combo, but it got super dry and now is more dry-normal. I had to totally overhaul my routine, and I don't even know if Reddit was around then (lol), but I certainly didn't know about it, so I just tried to research online as much as possible, but a lot of it was trial and error. There are so many more resources these days!

>So if I may ask, what's the purpose then of using the NuFace and the Salon Boost LED Light? Do they serve other purposes?

NuFace is a microcurrent device that helps with giving a lifted appearance and supposedly helps with brighter skintone and to decrease wrinkles. I certainly don't think you need it at your age, and you do have to use it continually in order for the results to continue. But I usually use it in the morning while I'm drinking my coffee and checking my email, so it doesn't really inconvenience me. The Boost LED mask is a newer product to me, and I have noticed it helping to calm my skin redness and make my skin look more plump. I don't know about any improvement in wrinkles yet, but I still appreciate it for the effects I've seen so far.

>How do you determine which you use on a given day? Does it go back to whether or not you're babying your skin, or would vitamin C be out of the equation if your skin was in babying form?

I have a schedule that I've literally written down to help remind me of what to use on any given day. HOWEVER, I learned several years ago to listen to my skin. :) I do usually skip Vit C if I'm trying to be more careful with my skin, but I find it's less irritating than acids or Retin-A.

>Also, have you tried other vitamin C serums (e.g., more expensive ones like SkinCeuticals, or Asian ones like Melano CC?

I've probably tried 10 Vit C serums over the years. SkinCeuticals is wonderful, but I find that I have great results with PC and MaeLove, so the price difference is not worth it for me, personally. :)

>If I may ask, what differences have you found by using an oil as compared to when you didn't use to use one? Also, do you have any preferred brands for things like Jojoba or Rosehip? I don't know if there's any real gradient in quality, or if it's all the same, so any retailer of the oil would suffice, y'know?

I love using oils. I honestly can't seen myself ever NOT using them. I find that my skin is much more plump, hydrated, and less flaking with using them. I've had great success with The Ordinary oils, as well as DermaE and have tried other ones, but can't recall them right now! I think starting with The Ordinary is a good place to start. 

>When you tried a bunch of products out, for those that didn't work for you, what'd you do with them? Did you just give them to friends or something along those lines? I myself don't have a ton of products (yet, but hopefully not too many in the long run), but if/when I do come across products that don't work with my skin, I'm nervous about how to properly dispose of them (especially during these times).

In the past, I've generally given products to my mother/family or friends that might have success with them. Obviously if it's a jar or something, I'll either try to use it up on my hands or body, or just throw it away (depending on what it is). I don't generally like just throwing things out if not absolutely necessary. :) EDIT: I just want to note that I hope it's okay that I don't have a ton of follow up questions or anything like that! Everything you wrote makes total sense, and I read all of it, of course, but I just happen to not have any more questions regarding most topics, haha.

> I have a schedule that I've literally written down to help remind me of what to use on any given day. HOWEVER, I learned several years ago to listen to my skin. :) I do usually skip Vit C if I'm trying to be more careful with my skin, but I find it's less irritating than acids or Retin-A.

I don't know if this is something you can answer, but do you have any advice on how to become more in sync with your skin and become better at listening to it? One of my concerns is that if something pops up that wasn't there before, I worry that due to my lack of experience/knowledge, I may not know how to address it properly, y'know? I do want to note that I recognize that this question is super open ended, so I would completely understand if you don't have an answer! **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* It‚Äôs a good color scheme though, screams ‚Äúthis is medical grade!‚Äù LOL this color scheme always says to me ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not trying to do anything fancy here‚Äù which my skin absolutely loves :) Finland approves the colour scheme.

(All jokes aside I feel like blue is very doctor/pharmaceutical colour that makes things feel trustworthy, and its used a lot. These all look great!) Hi, everyone!

Skin type: combination, sensitive, acne-prone. Currently on isotretinoin (Absorica) and acne-struggler for over 10 years. Have been through the ringer with dermatology and used every topical and taken likely every prescribed acne medication out there (all the cyclines, Bactrim, Spironolactone, two rounds of Iso when I was younger, etc.). My main goal is generally just to not bug my skin and keep it moisturized! Thanks for reading. :)

Routine/Thoughts
- Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser AM/PM - does the job, gets my makeup off way easier than CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser used to, and doesn‚Äôt have bad ingredients in it (to my best knowledge). Had to go back to using the CeraVe one for a wash recently and felt like I had to wash my face a million times for makeup to come off.

- CeraVe Moisturizing Cream AM/PM - obviously very moisturizing! But is VERY thick. I‚Äôve been using this since before going on isotretinoin. I do notice this sometimes leaves lines under my makeup because of the thickness so I try to sort of pat it in after massaging to avoid that haha! I do not like this non-pump package as I feel kind of gross digging my hands into it and I usually go for the pump one (this one was on sale at Costco though).

- La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume PM (occasionally) - Jury‚Äôs still out on this one. I heard good things about this for healing and will put it on angry acne spots over night. It seems to reduce the anger a bit so far.

- Aquaphor ALL DAY, EVERY DAY! This is a lifesaver for my lips and, to be honest, you‚Äôd probably consider me addicted to it. I do not use it anywhere else other than lips.

- Vaseline Advanced Repair AM - My body gets dry very easily and this lotion has worked better than any other for moisturizing and not having to reapply later on in the day. Not too thick or thin, and not oily.

- **Just purchased the Vanicream Daily Facial Moisurizer - I read about this new product last week and was SO excited because I‚Äôve been considering trying out a different moisturizer that isn‚Äôt soooo thick and I like that Vanicream strips away unnecessary bad ingredients! I literally just put it on today. Can update when I have a better feel of this product.

Other products not pictured:
- Dr. Dan‚Äôs  Cortibalm - I use this under Aquaphor. It is incredibly healing and can literally make dry, flaky, even peeled lips transform.

- Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - also works wonders overnight. It is quite sticky though, sort of like lip gloss.

- Rael Acne Patches - I‚Äôve tried multiple others (Might Patch and another on Amazon) and this one is thinner around the edges so it blends into my skin much better. They do really pull the gunk out of pustules. Ooooo that baume looks interesting. What do you use it for, what step is it in your routine, and how often do you use it? Would like to incorporate it into my routine. Very nice! (BTW my sister formulated that Vaseline lotion... sorry.. im kind of proud!) Can't go wrong with blue and white

What do you think of the Vanicream products? There must be a reason why most skincare line for sensitive skin only have WHITE & BLUE üòØ do you use the vaseline on your face as well or just the body Have you by any chance tried cerave hydrating cleanser and could compare it to the vanicream one? :) Shades of muted mid to dark to grey blue are often dubbed "corporate blue". It's used because it's seen as a trustworthy color that "instills calm, confidence, and connection". Maybe there's something to say about this skincare marketing! [https://www.marketplace.org/2019/12/26/the-color-of-the-year-is-a-corporate-shade/](https://www.marketplace.org/2019/12/26/the-color-of-the-year-is-a-corporate-shade/) I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some scientific study somewhere that suggests that consumers trust and associate with the medical field blue and white. Voila here you have a bunch of companies who are trying to draw on that Why 5 moisturizing products though? Your aesthetic has an aesthetic I‚Äôm seeing a lot of y‚Äôall use la roche Posays cicaplast. Is it that good? I wanted to love that cleanser so much, but it‚Äôs just too drying for me. Most of the products from Vanicream seem to be made for people with much oilier skin than I have. But I‚Äôm dry as a lizard. 

Looooove the Vaseline lotion and Cerave cream, though. They are staples here. You‚Äôve got some classics! Aquaphor is the best. I have that and the CeraVe and they‚Äôre part of my nightly slug life. üòä I just checked my skin care drawer in the bathroom and literally everything is in a tube. Dr Drey would be happy to see this. this looks a lot like my shelf. i‚Äôm on accutane and some of these products are life savers!

Thank you! I was just about to say, you def have a type! Lol How is the vanicream daily facial moisturizer? I have gone to the moisturizing cream at night due to eczema on my face and I‚Äôm interested in the daily... currently using cerave. This is very visually satisfying :) Yes!! My skincare is going very blue-and-white and pink-and-white recently. Bioderma micellar water, embryolisse cream, Cerave, Aquaphor... <3 It's such a good indicator of products that won't have random fragrance! Mine is all green and white ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Whatever works! saw this routine and instantly knew it was a fellow accutaner haha. good luck on your journey! YesüòÇ this colour make me feel so comfortable ...as i feel my skin came perfect as i looking to the product onlyüòÇ.... I love this colour so much it make me relax ü§© Looks like mine! Love it! Have you tried the Vanicream deodorant? I didn't know they made products for the face either. I love Vanicream! So smooth and non-greasy! Hey that is totally OK! All of my products are blue and white as well! La Roche Posay and Vanicream!!! lol Reading this post while rubbing my Vaseline lotion on my feet.  I love it but I get soooo bored looking at my skincare items. How do you like the Vaseline Advanced Repair? I love the vanicream cleanser! Have you tried Vanicream lite lotion? Wondering how different it is vs the daily facial moisturizer what is that vaseline stuff? There's a lot of C's, V's, and A's in the names as well... Omg same!!! Except mine is very different, larosay cleanser elf moisturizers some spf I don‚Äôt know the name to. All blue and white packaging haha didn‚Äôt even realize until you said something How do you not have cetaphil then lol Adapalene Hey babe, what are you doing later?

--Israel These are literally all staples in my routine. Scent-free and they work!! Isn't aquaphor for cuts and scrapes? Am I the only one who hasn‚Äôt had any good benefits from Cicaplast B5 Baume? I tried it as a moisturiser, over Hyaluronic acid, on red spots...it didn‚Äôt help it at all. I even used it as a barrier on my nasolabial folds if I was to use any actives and even then the folds looked red. That is so funny üòÇ Is the Vaseline lotion unscented as in masked fragrance or truly fragrance free? Oh that‚Äôs great to hear! Thank you :) Too bad CeraVe healing ointment has a silver cap then! I love that stuff way more than aquaphor Kawaii I think they contain methylparaben and fragrance Haha yes you‚Äôre so right! It does seem very medical. Somehow that feels ‚Äúclean‚Äù to me then. All fragrance free and simple. Some of them are my faves too, love the Vanicream cleanser, Eucerin lip balm and Cicaplast. I agree with you I was going to say the same thing! You mean what the pharmacy sells? This is hardly medical ü§£ Zo, Obagi, Skinceuticals is more medical than any of these Yes yes and that‚Äôs exactly what I want in skincare so their plan is working on me... :) YesüòÇ this colour make me feel so comfortable ...as i feel my skin came perfect as i looking to the product onlyüòÇ.... I love this colour so much it make me relax ü§© Using my skincare solely as an ode to Finland, thank you for noticing. Right? I also think doctor = clean in my head. Why don't you try double cleansing? It should make it easier for you to remove makeup. I use Albolene moisturizing cleanser before the Vanicream cleanser to make sure that all makeup and sunscreen has dissolved! It's also blue and white hehehe. 

Very intrigued by the LRP balm, will have to try! Please, please, PLEASE incorporate SPF into your routine, especially since you‚Äôre taking isotretinoin! When I did a round of isotretinoin, every time I skipped SPF because I wouldn‚Äôt spend much time outside, I would get a mild sunburn at best, or angry, irritated, peeling skin at worst. I also found that it made my acne scars and discoloration take a lot longer to heal. Plus all the sun damage ‚Äî just reading this stressed me out a little bit lol Do you not use an SPF? It‚Äôs very important, especially if you‚Äôre on isotretinoin. Those Rael patches are the only ones that don‚Äôt leave a red circle for days on my skin. They work so well!! I have the CeraVE moisturiser too and even with my dry skin type it is kinda overwhelmingly thick and moisturising! It kinda leaves a film on my skin and kinda makes it greasy so i‚Äôm going to try the Vanicream. Thank you! The Vaseline lotion is stickier than I'd prefer. Do you find it sticky? Do any of these have SPF? I‚Äôm looking for a new moisturizing SPF !! Is the Vanicream moisturizer a dupe for the Embryolisse Creme Concentr√©? Hello! I just posted my routine details. I use this just on angry acne inflamed areas as I heard it was really good with healing. If I have acne that has popped or something, I will put this or an acne patch on over night. I have not been using it long, but so far it seems to help slightly with healing! I use that as well. I am on differin and my skin barrier is damaged so with both of those my skin gets really irritated. The baum has b5 in it which is good for barrier repair and it's very soothing. Supposedly it was created for burns. I use it several times a day but it is really rich and creamy and if you have a normal barrier, you probably wont need it as frequently. Not OP but I use it too! My skin gets pretty red and irritated easily. I use it as the lest step of my nighttime routine. It locks everything in and my skin is more moisturized/ less red in the morning. I looooove it. That with aloe vera and welda skin food have saved my irritated mask skin. It doesn't hurt anymore to wear a mask all day at work! I use it last on over my entire face in the evenings for severe dryness and mild rosacea. Every evening. Agreed with what everyone else is saying, its fantastic! Really helps heal lips, too. What?! That‚Äôs awesome. Well tell her A+ from someone that neeeeeds a really moisturizing lotion for her body or she turns into a rock in the desert. I love the facial cleanser as it gets my makeup off easily, has a slick, clean feel, and no intense foaming.

Forgot to say: I just bought the new Vanicream Face Moisturizer and started using it today! So far feels good and is much lighter going on than what I‚Äôm used to but seems to be keeping the moisture so far today (I seem to lose moisture very quickly if a lotion is not strong enough!). For reference as a lot of people use it, Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel-cream (non-fragrance) has me dry again after I put my makeup on. Hope it helps. Not Op but I‚Äôve been using Vanicream Cleanser and their moisturizing lotion (formerly known as lite lotion) for years. I love the quality and have never had any issues with them. It‚Äôs quality skincare for a great price. I haven‚Äôt tried their daily facial moisturizer so I‚Äôm curious for OPs update. White symbolizes purity and cleanliness, blue symbolizes trust.  It‚Äôs why doctors and brides wear white, police wear navy.  White and blue is a good combo for skincare lol. I just use it on my body! I haven‚Äôt looked into the ingredients to see if I‚Äôd feel comfortable with that lotion on my face. Yes! I put this in my routine comment if you want to check that out too. But basically, I used to use that CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (lime green) for years. I decided to try out Vanicream after reading about how minimal it is and I like it way better (it is also fungal acne safe per skincarisma.com which is a plus). I don‚Äôt need to wash my face a bunch of times to get everything off of it, which looking back at the CeraVe one I did. That article is interesting, thanks for sharing! Yeah I see the trustworthy aspect. I feel like I expect a company with a dark-ish blue color to be pretty put together/professional. I‚Äôm just here for the moisture!! Good question - One for body, one for face, one only on spots, Aquaphor just for my lips! And then the extra face one is a new one I‚Äôm trying to possibly switch to. See what‚Äôs weird is I also consider myself a lizard, except my face isn‚Äôt quite as dry as the rest of my body these days. I actually feel like the vanicream cleanser makes me feel less dry than other ones have. What face cleanser do you use?? Please tell me more about the slug life. I bought some aquaphor to use on my hands since they're extra dry from wearing gloves and using hand sani all the time now, but I'm not sure if it's actually doing anything? Where/how do you use the aquaphor and how much do you use? Haha yes they really are! Good luck on your accutane course (: Done! Thank you. Not OP but I use it and absolutely loooooove it. It's similar in texture to CeraVe PM but it feels a little more deeply moisturizing on the skin, maybe because it has squalane. It also doesn't have cetearyl alcohol or ceteareth-20 which seem to break me out Theory: Maybe we‚Äôre just catching on that, based on our specific skin type, scientists group skincare together by color... and that‚Äôs all we had to figure out this whole time to have nice skin.ü§®üßê Well I had no idea they made deodorant. Do you use it? Omg I feel the same way. I have always been very conservative and RARELY try anything new or exciting because my skin is soo likely to freak out (and bc I‚Äôm always working with a derma and don‚Äôt want to muddy the process). BUT then people talk about random products that have completely transformed their skin and I want to partake!! No I haven‚Äôt which now I‚Äôm wondering why not haha! Looking at the lite lotion it looks very very minimal compared to this. This new one includes squalane (which I know a lot of people here love... but I don‚Äôt really know anything about) as well as hyaluronic acid while the lite one doesn‚Äôt. Have you used the lite one? How do you like it? Please tell me more about why you love it. I've bought some aquaphor and am not crazy about it, so am looking for potential alternatives. New to this group, and I have similar skin issues! Where can I buy them? Thanks! That Eurecin lip balm is The Best. After years of "blue and white are the colours of the flag" how could I not notice, and we are as always humbled that someone would take the time to notice such a small Nordic country. We shall celebrate the occasion on the market squares.

And yes, blue for medical and clean, green for natural and health. I think there's a branch of science for the effect colours have on us, and why brands use them like they do? I love aquaphor for my lips too! Did you know they make it in a stick now?! I haven‚Äôt considered double cleansing before. This vanicream cleanser removes my makeup easily, but definitely interested to make sure I‚Äôm not missing stuff I can‚Äôt see. Haha perfect, I must get it then! Haha oh no sorry to stress you out! As I said to another poster above, I am rarely outside (pre-quarantine as well). And if I am, I am generally in my car and maybe going right into a store. This is my third round so I totally feel you on the skin sensitivity to light, peeling etc. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with that this round (just lip dryness of course). I do wear a cap if I am actually going to be outside in the sun for any amount of time! I generally do not really trust the ingredients in face spf to not break me out, so I‚Äôm curious based on your commitment to wearing it if you have found any holy grail ones?? Yes good point. I don‚Äôt currently as I haven‚Äôt found one that I like. But I‚Äôm rarely out in the sun  at all (even pre-quarantine), and I use a baseball cap if I am. Any recommendations anyway? I don‚Äôt find it sticky. I‚Äôve been using the intensive care lotion for a couple years and I generally can‚Äôt stand sticky or oily products! They do not. But in a few other comments, other people have recommended different face spfs! Many people seem to love Elta MD products which is what I am gonna start with. Embryolisse is definitely thicker. I got the Vanicream moisturizer about 3 days ago, I have oily/combo skin and I managed to damage my skin barrier badly within the past few months trying to get rid of fungal acne (another reason I need to be mindful of ingredients for) - I‚Äôve been breaking out and needed a basic light moisturizer for my oily/acne prone zones and this has worked beautifully so far üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è It feels light and absorbs quickly but leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. 

My skin has calmed down, no current active breakouts, and I believe the moisturizer has absolutely carried its weight in my routine lol Ooh I‚Äôve never heard of that! Is it good? Just looked it up and the ingredients look pretty different than the vanicream to me so I‚Äôm thinking probs not? I misread that as bums and was wondering if you meant homeless people or baby butts. I‚Äôm always scared of it clogging my pores , because of the thick consistency? Is this just me thinking that ? Because I‚Äôd love to use it as it on tret and it is causing havoc on my skin barrier ! Ok wanna know my trick to getting that moisturiser to really set in deeply? Rub your arms/legs with witch hazel first, it acts like a toner and helps the moisturiser to absorb. I tried this once because I had a bottle of witch hazel I wasn't using and figured, why not see if this works? It's perfect in winter when you're using the really thick stuff. Where did you acquire the facial moisturizer? I've only been able to find the regular lotions from Vanicream. I have their bar for the shower. Their ‚Äòno perfume‚Äô smell is a little odd but once i got used to it i really like the product. i feel like green is good as well
cause it makes you feel like it‚Äôs more natural I did not know this. Super interesting! Do you feel like the Vanicream one is stripping at all? I‚Äôve been using the Cerave one and I feel like it doesn‚Äôt clean enough even on my dry skin. I want to switch :) Thank you so much for your response! üôèüèº Cerave Hydrating cleanser isn't really best for removing makeup, it's more used as a second cleanser or if you're not wearing makeup/sunscreen . Removing makeup and sunscreen usually requires an oil cleanser I usually use Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash. It‚Äôs worked out for me for the last few years. I use it as my last step at night on my face, over EVERYTHING else. When I first heard about people doing this I thought ‚ÄúWHHHAAAAHHHH?????‚Äù because I figured it would lead to clogged pores and all the fun stuff clogged pores do, but nope! It leads to soft, supple skin that feels like heaven to the touch.

I use a lot of actives (retin a, glycolic acid, lactic acid, etc etc) so the Aquaphor helps sooth my skin and repair it overnight. I absolutely LOVE it! 

I use about a tablespoon‚Äôs worth each night, maybe a bit more, but that‚Äôs probably more than is actually necessary. I always end up with a lot left on my hands so I just try to rub it into my elbows, hands, and anywhere else that needs it. Next time I buy it I‚Äôm gonna get the giant tube - I think it‚Äôs like 12 or 16 oz - because I‚Äôve been going through the 1.7 oz tubes like mad. Fantstic, thanks! I use a lot of blue and white products too and I have sensitive skin. I've noticed formulations for sensitive skin often have blue and white. Green packaging often seems to indicate that the product has ingredients from plants Not yet. A dermatologist recommended I try it. My underarms stay pretty dry and itchy. I've had trouble finding a deodorant that takes care of those problems and also controls odor. Not the OP but I use the lite lotion and love it. Its super thin compared to the regular moisturizer (not the facial one), but has identical ingredients iirc. It absorbs very quickly and doesn't leave a super tacky feeling. It's no where near as occlusive as the normal one and sits much better under any makeup. I save the thicker normal one for things like rashes or suuuuper dry scaly spots (such as my wrists from excessive hand washing lately) and apply it at night, and use the lite lotion literally everywhere else. I have pretty dry skin and have used the lite and regular moisturizer for a looong time. I need a few pumps of the lite but it drys quick and has a pretty clean feeling. I use this all the time
hah I have really dry skin and eczema and use the healing ointment for several things. I use it on my lips and on dry patches. It is similar to Vaseline in its consistency but feels a bit easier to rub into the skin kind of like coconut oil. Because it contains dimethicone, panthenol and hylauronic acid I use it as an eye cream. I also use it on minor cuts and burns. I buy the large squeeze tube and it‚Äôs also available in a two pack of smaller tubes if you want to test it out. Me too. (: All of these items should be at Target as that‚Äôs where I usually get them. Except I purchased the new vanicream moisturizer on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BW46XXK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_3c7xFbCS0ZDKB. Hope that helps! It‚Äôs especially handy for when you‚Äôre out and about and don‚Äôt want to touch your mouth. I prefer the regular for overnight but the sticks are handy handy when haven‚Äôt JUST washed your hands. Using oil with a surfactant will allow you to dissolve your makeup and then wash it off with water (thanks to the surfactant in the oil cleanser). After that you can proceed with any gentle (foaming) cleanser. :) This is me suddenly being so invested in your aesthetic that I've googled "mild oil cleanser" to scan which ones are packaged in blue and white. ( laneige cream skin milk oil cleanser and neutrogena light cleansing oil both fit the color scheme <-- \*not\* endorsements! LOL) 

# SPF is essential even if you‚Äôre indoors! Windows can only block out UVB rays, not the UVA rays that contribute to premature aging, dark spots, and other visual signs of sun damage. My favorite sunscreens (that also also fungal acne safe, which has been my most recent skin issue) are the EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 and the Hada Labo UV White Gel (SPF 50/PA++++). The sunscreen that got me through isotretinoin was the Neutrogena Clear-Face Sunscreen (SPF 30 or 55), which is super affordable, easy to find, and did not break me out even on isotretinoin. I‚Äôve recently (a few months ago) started using Elta MD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 and I have been so pleased with it! I also have combination acne-prone skin and it feels like the right amount of moisturization for me without feeling oily. I feel like my skin actually feels ‚Äúglow-y‚Äù when I apply it! It‚Äôs a bit pricey but it‚Äôs been worth it for me.

Although this product would throw a wrench in your color scheme lol Purito brand is my favorite!! but they also say that krave beauty is good too! I really like the Purito unscented green level sunscreen. Also the Klairs airy UV essence I thought this as well until recently but skincare twitter says I should wear sunscreen even inside (which I haven‚Äôt done yet lol) even for the 1 time I go outside for like 5 minutes a day I‚Äôve started wearing it. Can‚Äôt believe it took me until this summer & being 26 to start wearing it daily. Not OP but I have similar skin, and would get really sensitive to avobenzone sunscreens. 

Now I‚Äôm using Australian Gold tinted mineral spf 50 and it‚Äôs awesome. Not so expensive, worth a shot! Alright, thank you so much! Maybe I‚Äôll try that too?! My generic Walgreens copy CeraVe spf moisturizer leaves my face white like a ghost üòÇ We have the same skin type with damaged skin barrier from trying to treat fungal acne!! How thick is the vanicream moisturizer? Would you recommend using it in the daytime under sunscreen? I usually get very sticky in the AM. So you've liked the Vanicream better? I find that I usually prefer thicker creams I've used the Embryolisse before (only when I was in France though and got it for the same price as the Vanicream, its price doubles when you try to pick it up state-side) and it was really smooth and nice! It has a nice matte finish and isn't heavy or thick. There is a strong scent to it that people generally like because it smells luxurious, but I'm pretty sensitive to smells so I didn't really care for it. Oh no, I would never call a homeless person a bum, however, talking about butts is fun. I was super worried about that too! I had some crazy breakouts recently and I stopped using it. Turns it they were hormonal. I get really flushed red cheeks and this has decreased the redness so much.  It makes using retinol less harsh on my skin. If you live in the US, CVS has amazing return policies on skin care & makeup. I found it on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BW46XXK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_QAOxFbQR80C5A. There were a couple days where it said unavailable and that there was no timeline for when it would be back in stock. But then all of a sudden it was back a couple days later and I snatched it up. Looks like it‚Äôs in stock now! On their website. It‚Äôs their newest product. They sell it at target and Walgreens, at least in my area. Yes, green is ‚Äúnatural‚Äù (ie old school Garnier), pink is feminine, red is passion.  You can look at different brands and even what kind of font and imagery they use to make you think and feel a certain way about a product. No I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs stripping more than what it should! I know that feeling of over-dryness that can happen after cleansing and I don‚Äôt get that with the Vanicream one. I didn‚Äôt get that with the CeraVe either, but definitely agree with you that it could clean much better than it does. If it helps, I‚Äôm on Accutane right now and I‚Äôm using the same Vanicream cleanser to prevent and combat the dryness that I used to get with my previous (already gentle) cleanser! My green and white are all Simple and CeraVe. Ooh good to know. I will have to try that one after this facial moisturizer. Thank you! That's super helpful, thanks! Thank you very much! Well this was a total science lesson. I‚Äôm ashamed I did not know this and going to be finding an spf now. I‚Äôve heard many many people praise Elta MD so I may start there. Thank you!! Well then it‚Äôs a NO obviously. But really, I‚Äôve heard many people say Elta MD is amazing so I think I‚Äôll be trying that first. Thank you!! I also love Elta MD. Another great one (that I actually love even more) is DRMTLGY. It‚Äôs fantastic and cheaper than EltaMD. I think it‚Äôs also less drying for me. Thank you!! Thank you!! why would you wear sun cream inside? Thank you! I‚Äôll look into that one. It‚Äôs on the watery side rather than the creamy one. Consistency-wise it reminded me of CeraVe Facial Pm Lotion but smoother (the ingredients in that one didn‚Äôt play well with my skin -even when it absorbed my skin didn‚Äôt feel moisturized if that makes sense? lol - then again I‚Äôve had problems with a few CeraVe products)

A few dots around my face do the trick for me, it spreads easily. I try to be gentle with my problem areas so after spreading I lightly pat what‚Äôs left of the moisturizer in and it absorbs so nicely - I don‚Äôt feel the product just sitting on top of my skin but I do feel it‚Äôs effects; my skin feels smooth. Here are a few pictures, I hope it shows the consistency better than I can explain it lol. 

[Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/OMDXO2g) May I ask what you used for your Hormonal acne ? I think that‚Äôs why biggest problem because it is always on my cheeks and chin area ( the area where a person would get a beard I guess is a way to describe it ) and I have heard that is an indication of hormonal acne Thank you so much! I‚Äôll definitely give it a try then! Thank you! No need to be ashamed! It‚Äôs better to start now than never :,) The EltaMD one I recommended is really good but it‚Äôs about $36 per bottle ‚Äî I only ever use it when I‚Äôm wearing makeup because it‚Äôs a good base! So if you want to start with something more affordable first then definitely go with the Neutrogena Clear-Face sunscreen The EltaMD Clear is so good. I once bought it online at Costco. Great price! Also, Walmart online offers it at a pretty good price too. Good luck. Thanks! I‚Äôll have to look into that! I used to live in an apartment with huge windows that got a ton of sun. Even with blinds it didn't block most of it out. I didn't notice until I moved out but on the side of my face that faced the windows I have obvious sun damage. Now I used sunscreen every day, even when I'm not leaving the house. My guess is that because UV light can still enter in through windows. They said the UV rays still come through the windows. Sure thing! Honestly, I normally use the roche posay effaclar tube. I use that in conjunction with the cicaplast and it does absolute wonders. 

I‚Äôve also cut way back on gluten. My moms allergic and I‚Äôve noticed it makes me bloat, get headaches, and breakout/ redness. Just fyi there are a lot of fakes on Amazon! I avoid buying skin care products there **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I totally agree. I don't miss the money and clutter of having a lot of skincare products that I barely use I love having a simple routine that works! I mean, it's not just the simplicity, it's the fact that you're now using probably the most potent and evidence-based (prescription in most countries) topical. I mean. you also added tret to your routine. it's more than likely that that's why your skin looks it's best. That lip balm is the only one that helps with my severely chapped and cracked lips. Also nice spf! Where do you buy the P20? 1. **Skin type:** 29/M balanced Fitzpatrick Type III
2. **Skin goals:** even texture, preventative anti-aging
3. **Full skincare routine:**

* **AM**
   * Riemann P20 Suncare for Kids SPF 50+
      * Holy grail. Insanely strong UVA protection (SPF and UVAPF over 50). Alcohol free, unscented, amazing filters. Comes in a pump bottle, with 1 pump being the exact  amount for your face. Goes on with a white cast, but disappears very shortly, leaving a slightly shiny/dewy appearance. (I can't speak for darker skin types, but it is invisible on me). Just amazingly good protection and finish. WRP.
   * Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm SPF 25
      * Overall decent UVA protection for your lips, while also moisturizing. Don't love the minty feel on my lips, so when I do repurchase it will be the unflavored kind.
* **PM**
   * Hada Labo Gokujyun Oil Cleansing
      * Really great oil cleanser. Cheap and effective. Unscented and gentle. Helps remove sunscreen and also gently exfoliates. WRP.
   * Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser
      * Amazing cleanser. Actually cleanses unlike Cerave Hydrating Cleanser. Doesn't strip. My face feels so clean and smooth after this, especially if I double cleansed with oil before. Completely free of anything that could irritate your skin. WRP.
   * Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion
      * Good lightweight moisturizer. Has niacinamide and ceramides which I love. I actually prefer Cerave Skin Renewing Nightcream because it's a bit heavier and has peptides, but this is good and can be used during the day as well. Might repurchase, but will probably go with the Skin Renewing Night Cream.
   * 0.05% Tretinoin
      * Absolute HG. Use this 6 days per week, with one off-day to give my skin a break. I can't gush enough about tret. It has done more for my skin than anything else. My skin is even toned and firm, and hasn't looked this good since I was 21. My game-plan is to use tretinoin daily for 2 years to reverse sun damage from my youth, and then use it twice per week for maintenance (this is based off Dr. Dray's advice).  WRP.

The only products I'm considering incorporating into this routine are Vitamin C (Skinceuticals CE Ferulic) and a chemical exfoliant (The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution). Right now I want to be gentle with my skin since I'm on tret. Once I reduce my tret usage to twice per week I'll incorporate them. My nightly routine will cycle between Vitamin C, AHA/BHA, and tret, with a rest day on Sunday. I love that Cerave PM lotion!!! It's seriously changed my life and done so much good for my oily sensitive skin Curious where you got this Tretinoin. I use the exact same one. Purchased at the Farmacia next to my house for $1.43usd / 30 pesos How do you like that cleansing oil? I have a nearly identical routine. So I agree! Most skincare products are useless or cause more problems than they‚Äôre worth. I really want to buy the p20 but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll be too shiny for my skin. Have you tried Purito Centella Unscented SPF 50+, and if so, how does the finish compare? I love Vanicream üòò I got that tret in m√©xico. It‚Äôs like $1 per tub. Wild. it's the Tret Lmao simplicity and using an extremely powerful topical retinoid. But I *do* agree with you, you don't need many products when you're using a powerhouse like tret. Most skincare is a huge crock of shit. absolutely agree! my skin has improved a lot since switching to a simpler routine with simpler products/ingredients. Is that lip balm from Jack Black actually good? Makes me think of when you first start off your skin care journey and you have like 74748748392 products cause you're still figuring out what works for you üòÇ Where did you get your oil cleanser? I love the packaging! My routine looks a lot like yours. Same oil cleanser, and I'm using tret as well. Have been for about 5 months. No improvements to my acne yet. Oh well. Hopefully I'll see some change soon. If there‚Äôs one thing I learned as a skin care specialist, it‚Äôs this: the more you simplify your skincare routine, the better. Less products is always better. Be gentle and pamper your skin, too many harsh acids/exfoliants can mess up the moisture barrier and over all health of your skin. I use grapeseed oil and love it. When I damaged my skin barrier from a physical scrub back when I thought sugar scrubs were a good idea *hysterical laugh*, grapeseed oil alone completely helped heal it. That occurrence started me into skincare and so I can‚Äôt be *too* mad about my stupidity, but I‚Äôve used grapeseed oil ever since. YES! I LOVE the Vanicream Cleanser! It's hands-down the best cleanser I've used in 20 years. I totally agree! A few years ago I was using a LOT of products and always wondered why my skin was literally falling of my face...until I realized simpler = better. Since companies have started selling products with just one active ingredient, I got caught up in those and bombarded my skin with a million different serums... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThank god people are slowly leaning towards a more simple, evidence-based routine. üôå Now I'm all about my beloved Retinoids and sunscreen! üòå

btw that P20 Lotion is liquid gold! Versatile, very reliable, solid UV protection! Tret made me simplify my routine and it's the best thing I've ever done. The PM cerave is a disaster for me unfortunately :/
The product just stays on my skin and becomes flaky :/ I‚Äôm the first pic right now, just got into skincare and felt like I needed every product on the market In the process of finding a good routine right now and it‚Äôs so difficult. I don‚Äôt want to use a million products but even when I‚Äôve tried a much simpler routine my skin still looked dull and shitty even though technically I was using decent products. Idk why my skin acts like an angsty teenager. Congrats you narrowed bigtime or I‚Äôm sorry you lost a huge fraction of income;) I did the exact same and was actually using a ton of the same products as your first pic. Now I stick to only 4-5 steps, morning and night, but I switched everything I use to Nola Skinsentials and my skin is doing so much better. I hate that I spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on skincare and now I don‚Äôt own a product over $25 and my skin looks amazing. 

Less is definitely more While I do agree less is often more when it comes to skin care, I suspect the main benefit there was due to the tret. I had the best skin of my life when I used tret and nothing I tried before or since had anything close to the same effect. Unfortunately, the cost is prohibitive for me. Wait, did you use all 15 products? I love the Vanicream cleanser! I tried it for the first time a few months ago and have already ordered backups ‚ù§Ô∏è I see what you did there. Got the px on the retin a Why the switch from the CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser to Vanicream? I've been using the CeraVe and thought it was working well. Is it more gentle? OMG same. I only use three products at most on my skin. Sunscreen is always a must, but less is more. I found just rinsing my face with water in the morning instead of a cleanser has helped a lot too. Love that Vanicream cleanser! That brand is a huge HG for me; it doesn't get nearly enough love. I should look into getting some tretinoin too Tretinoin eliminated most of the products that I used in my past routines. Would you say the same for you? I love this!! This is what I am aiming my routine to eventually look like. I am on week 10 of tret but planning to introduce Vit C on week 16. Eventually I will hope to just have Vit C + Sunscreen for the AM, and Double Cleansing, Moisturiser and Tret for the PM! Whats your skincare routine? To be fair, Tretinoin does the work of like 10 products on its own I love that people are really paring their routines down and spending way less on skincare. We‚Äôre doing it, guys. We‚Äôre growing up. Vanicream is such a hidden gem!  I always thought of it as an old lady cream, but then I tried it and felt like an idiot for ignoring it for so long! Same! I'm just using like 3 or 4 essentials comparing to 11 step like I used to and my skin is thanking me Pretty similar to mine! Love love LOVE the Hada Labo oil cleanser. My skin has been sensitive and angry my whole life and it‚Äôs always scary for me to commit to a new product but this was an immediate win for my skin and I. Also great for removing makeup. Were there any products you used in your previous routine that were harder to eliminate? NICE! I also cut down my routine to a few products now! I‚Äôm glad that worked out for you too! You have to go through some products to find out what works for you. Glad you found your routine! Simplicity is nice! I use a variety of products because my skin has different needs in the summer, the winter, and at certain times of my cycle 2020, but with vitamin c&e serum in the AM and micellar water for makeup removal in PM.

ugh i cant help but feel like ill regret not putting on those nutritional serum and oil and all that fancy nancy stuff when im older tho... i hope theyre all gimmicky things bc im about to minimize too. Love that lip balm That lip balm is the beeeest Is the p20 spf 50 only in spray form ? I can‚Äôt find it as a liquid ! Loving it. And same Love that cleansing oil! I tried the cerave night cream, but I felt like it was pilling. Could have been reacting to a serum though Cerave PM is the best ever! Badly need some reviews anout the P20 sunscreen, I have ordered this for weeks but that shit just takes forever to arrive It also saves time not having so many products in your routine lol. So win win :) When are you supposed to use an oil cleanser? Forbidden toothpaste I love this! My core routine is like 6 products as well,  but I'm trying to use up other stuff and I can't wait until that stuff is used up üòÜ I use that same oil cleanser. I have been through at least 15 bottles of it. I'll never use anything else. Even six is too many for most, I‚Äôd say. My dermatologist told me to stop using the five face products I was using and start just washing my face with water and mild soap twice a day, and my skin is better than ever. lol i've been staying with my bf for 2 months and i dont have any skin care products here except my avene sun screen so i bought some random micellar water to take off my make up (couldnt find any cleansing oil) and a nivea moisturizer and what can i say - my skin is looking the best it has in 3 years, ever since i first got acne


maybe its the happy hormones but idk i feel a simpler routine does a lot for me Hello! Does the riemann p20 kids burn your eyes? U get the tretinoin in Mexico? Here in farmacias similares cost around 1.5 dollars lol More than one ordinary?

How was your skin alive? Yes p20!! That stuff is the best Really enjoying the downsizing trend I‚Äôm seeing of skincare and makeup! We don‚Äôt need 15 products and an hour-long regimen to get decent skin.

And a lot of our skin‚Äôs quality also comes from general nutrition and water intake (with maybe some help outside of cleansers/moisturizers). [deleted] Wow that‚Äôs some hell of a line. !! Love it Less is more!! Always :D YES! I swear my skin must have been suffocating under all the product I used to put on it. The more simple my daily routine, the better my skin seem to respond. Nice! I just incorporated adapalene into my skincare routine for similar reasons. How long did it take you to see results you liked? My skin looks good and I can tell a difference after a few days but I think it will take a while for it to really work. It‚Äôs like we go through this entire journey just to end up back at the basics. I wonder if I ruined my own skin sometimes lol arent you afraid of missing out on those vitamins and minerals and whatnot like all the hyped up things ...like snail extract..or other things.. that people put on nowadays? it's like fomo but for skincare..like hyraunic acid.. always wondered how people manage to carry out such a detailed and complex routine. I mean, it must take an eternity while you have other things to do [removed] Simpler is always better imo. I always get so happy when I see people ditching the insane amounts of product & focusing on what actually works. Knowing that you've found a good routine is so inspirational! 

I don't like seeing hauls & trend focused shelfies, this is "skincare addiction" not "shopping addiction". [deleted] Good point about the money! It's definitely way cheaper now. The most expensive product I own now is the sunscreen at $20. But it's worth it for the UVA protection. (And it's cheaper than Purito Centella Green Level Unscented per ml!) What Is tretinoina for? That's true. Tret has helped my skin immensely. But with my old routine, even with the exfoliants and Vit C, my skins tone and texture was unpredictable. True!

Regardless, my skin's texture and tone was unpredictable with my old routine, which included exfoliants and Vit C.

So yes: tret and a simple routine is the way to go, IMO. Amazon.co.uk

The shipping charge is high, especially for 1 bottle, but IMO it's worth it. I just bought 2 replacement bottles at once to mitigate the shipping charge. It's still lower per ml than Purito. My lips are really dry too and the cocoa butter Vaseline has been the best thing to ever happen to them. [deleted] Did you get tretinoin over the counter or was it prescribed? is there a reason you use the sunscreen for kids rather than the normal line? i just searched in the amazon for my country and i'd have to pay double the price if i want to get the one for kids :/ I think this is perfect except I would do the vitamin C during the day under your SPF I ordered that sunscreen for the summer and although it personally leaves my skin a little sticky, I love the protection that it offers! I wonder if it might not be as noticeable in the winter months... I will definitely order it again regardless. Where are some reliable places to get the p20 sunscreen? Your routine looks great. Simpler is definitely better imo. Have you thought about Cosrx blackhead power liquid as an exfoliant? It‚Äôs a super gentle BHA because it uses betaine salicylate instead of salicylic acid. I have crazy sensitive and reactive skin, and this doesn‚Äôt even tingle. It also doesn‚Äôt dry out my skin. It might be easier to incorporate than a harsher exfoliant. How did you get tretionin?? It's impossible to buy in some countries - only possible with a prescription if you have severe acne... Where did you get yours? That's a good plan to use tret daily for 2 years then twice a week to maintain. Just heard it now. Been using tret for 6 months and only three times a week so far. So, based on Dr.Dray's advice, I should build up to daily use? Whew, still a long way to go lol. How long have been on tret? Reading this post, I think I'll start to increase to 4-5 times this week and slowly build up to use it 6 times or daily. Where do you buy the Hada Labo cleansing oil?? Amazon? I didn‚Äôt know dr dray recommended twice a week for maintenance !! I thought she used it everyday herself ! When are you planning on switching to that? How did you figure out what type of skin you have? New to this. 

Your nighttime routine.......Is this the order that you apply the products?

&#x200B;

The Tret should do on last OVER the night cream? That was my favorite evening lotion for years. Then something changed and now it creates a burning sensation and I get red breakouts on my cheeks. I'm so disappointed and haven't been able to find a good replacement! I loved the PM for like 2 weeks and then it started giving me little cysts ‚òπÔ∏è it‚Äôs got so much good stuff in it and I love the consistency. I wish I could find a decent replacement Yeah, it's really good! which one , link please my face is little oily and sensitive . Thanks [deleted] Same here! Stocked up when I was in Tulum for 47 pesos! they expire in 2022, so hopefully travel is open again by then! I really like it. It's no-frills, cheap, gentle, and effective. 

The only complaint (which isn't really a complaint for me), is that it is a bit thick at first. But after some heat and friction it thins out quickly. It rinses off easily too. 

Since I'm using daily tret, I don't want to go overboard with actives so this works as both a cleanser and a gentle physical exfoliant. My face after double cleansing feels clean and smooth. Would definitely recommend. The Purito finish is definitely superior. It's moisturizing but doesn't leave a shiny finish or white cast. Maybe not great for oily skin but good for everyone else. 

P20 is shinier, but the UVA filters are better and it's water/sweat-proof. You could probably use a translucent powder in addition to this if shine is your concern. Same, best cleanser I've tried for my sensitive/oily/acne prone skin! In r/tretinoin, we often talk about how tretinoin inevitably leads to paring down your skincare routine to just the basics. Tret, gentle cleanser, moisturizer, spf, and maybe some other active if you can tolerate it and you‚Äôre set! It is my HG. I love the black tea and grapefruit flavors, and also don‚Äôt care for the mint!

It is lanolin based and is super hydrating. It's probably my least favorite product from my routine just because of the minty flavor. But it moisturizes well and provides decent UVA protection. The finish is not glossy, which I like. I'd recommend getting the unflavored one, unless you like the minty tingle. Not OP but it‚Äôs the best lip balm I‚Äôve ever used and is actually really moisturizing. My favorite scents are the Shea butter (vaguely vanilla/marshmallow type scent) and the black tea and blackberry. Neither of those leave a sort of minty tingle. I actually keep the shea butter one next to my bed and use it as an overnight lip balm instead of using a heavier overnight balm as I find this works just as well. I am a nut for lip balm and TBH this is just expensive flavored Aquaphor. I like it okay, but the price is unreasonable for what it is. I got it on Amazon! Grapeseed oil as an oil cleanser? How does the finish of the p20 compare to other SPF that you‚Äôve tried? I‚Äôm really interested in it!! Tret is definitely a miracle product. However, I pared down my routine before starting tret and there was a noticeable difference. My skin was less irritated and more reliably even and smooth. 

It's really more than just the tret. For me at least, it's using gentle, non-irritating ingredients, a high UVA PF sunscreen, and a minimal routine. Yes! I did cycle between the exfoliants but otherwise each product was used daily. So 13 products daily. I think Vanicream cleanses better than CeraVe.both are gentle. Hm. Not really. I actually eliminated a lot of products prior to starting tret.

I was getting frustrated that my skin was still looking "blah" and unpredictable, and couldn't pinpoint the exact product because there were so many.

I started watching Dr. Dray on YouTube and she advocates for a simple routine of cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. So that's what I did and my skin started to improve. Tret was always on my wishlist and I eventually incorporated it 6.5 months ago and haven't looked back. It's my favorite product.

But I would say that simplifying my routine has cut out a lot of the guesswork and has saved a ton of money, in addition to improving my skin. It's in a comment in this thread. What 10 products? If anything it might be able to do the same thing as Vitamin C and an exfoliant. Probably the azaleic acid and the Vitamin C serum. I really like what the azaleic acid did for the tone and texture of my skin. And the Vitamin C is amazing for brightening.

I stopped the azaleic and will probably not repurchase for a while because it apparently inhibits beard growth and I want my beard on my cheeks to fill out.

I'll be reincorporating vitamin C soon tho since I've finally adjusted to the 0.05% tret. Mine's liquid. As far as I know it only comes as liquid. I saw some one posted it here [https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/hx1un2/riemann\_p20\_kids\_spf\_50/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/hx1un2/riemann_p20_kids_spf_50/)

It looks too shiny in my liking. And some redditors who live in similar climate as me said it's too greasy too (humid tropical southeast asia) Right before your facial cleanser There is a very slight tingling sensation, but it doesn't burn my eyes personally. Lol, it was the niacinamide, rosehip oil, moisturizer and azaleic acid. Only one active.

I did love the azaleic acid tho. It works very well. There's never any residue, even in my beard. I also use a konjac sponge which I think helps with cleansing.

I used to use CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and that one didn't clean very effectively. 

Why do you want to switch from Simple? Just a heads up, adapalene does not have proven scientific studies to back any claim for anti aging like tret does. I don't think it fair to ask apples and oranges to correlate if you'll have the same results as OP. Honestly, it took probably a month to see good results. I swear my skin looked worse up until that point.

Then when I bumped up my dosage from 0.025% to 0.05%, the same thing happened. My skin finally adjusted a few weeks ago.

Be patient! It is a miracle product. Not really. I've been into skincare for about 7 years now and have tried a lot of the fad ingredients. They don't really do too much IMO and are kind of a waste of money.

Now that I've found a routine that's cheap, quick, lean, and effective, I don't feel the need to experiment constantly with new products. >like all the hyped up things

What does manliness have to do with skincare? I love unscented Purito because it layers so well and I find it moisturizing! But there are concerns floating around that maybe the Purito filters aren't strong enough, which defeats the whole purpose. 

I know you already mentioned that your sunscreen cast fades and is a little shiny, but have you ever noticed any pilling after you apply? (I ask since I noticed La Roche-Posay likes to pill, at least the formulation I have, which is a no-go for me) I'm considering giving P20 a shot! How does this one compare to Purito? I've been wanting to try this one since Cyrille Laurent spoke about it on his channel but I have doubts, currently I use Purito as well but this looks more affordable! [deleted] Tretinoin is considered a ‚Äúretinoid‚Äù and is similar in structure to vitamin A. It was initially developed as an acne preventative, but it‚Äôs also been shown to reduce sun damage and age-related fine lines and wrinkles. I think there‚Äôs even a form of it that is used to treat a type of leukemia when taken orally now. 

Scientists aren‚Äôt entirely sure why it works only that it does. One reason is that it tends to keep pores clear when applied topically.

Edit: It‚Äôs not a wonder cream for everyone, it‚Äôs not well tolerated by sensitive skin types and it can even damage some people‚Äôs‚Äô skin, which is why it‚Äôs by prescription only.

Edit: If you‚Äôd like the current scientific consensus on the modes of action you can visit the [Tretinoin Wikipedia Page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tretinoin) Well yeah, tret is way stronger than anything you can buy without a prescription. I think you said in another comment that you‚Äôre thinking of adding Vit C? What‚Äôs your reason, and do you think it‚Äôll help? I‚Äôm considering whether I want to add it back in my routine; I‚Äôm not sure it was worth it. Ahh I see. Glad to see someone else who looks at price/ml! I'm looking for a good value spf but unfortunately the options are very limited in the US. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

So I'm curious as well. 
And does anyone know the reason why it isn't available over the counter here (could it be harmful)? If you're in or near Mexico, It's OTC there and very cheap. The one OP has costs about 2 dollars for 40 grams and it's 0.05%. Typically "for kids" suggests ingredients for sensitive skin. I don't really know the difference between this one and the one marketed for adults. All I know is that it has a super high UVA PF. There's a huge difference, totally different ingredients and especially filters between the two. actually it‚Äôs better to use vitamin c at night because it can cause photosensitivity and a reaction to sunlight if used during the day. it stays in your skin for up to three days so doesn‚Äôt need to be freshly applied for it do it‚Äôs thing I commented in another place in this post, but i ordered min from Cloud 10 Beauty. Amazon.co.uk I'll look into it! Do you find that it improves your skins texture? Which country do you live in? Hey there is a tretinoin subreddit that can help answer some of your questions If you're in or near Mexico, It's OTC there and very cheap. The one OP has costs about 2 dollars for 40 grams and it's 0.05%. It‚Äôs against the rules to help people get prescription stuff without a script. (It‚Äôs prescription only in the USA) so just FYI if nobody answers you, they just don‚Äôt wanna break the rules You should watch [this video](https://youtu.be/i53HP7b23A0) from her. The piece about a couple years of daily use, then maintenance is from 11:38 - 12:22. I can't really say what's right for you, but maybe you can glean what's right from all the info out there.

I've been on daily tret for 6.5 months. I recently moved up from 0.025% to 0.05% a month and a half ago and my skin has finally adjusted. I buy it on YesStyle, wait for a sale and buy a bunch to get free shipping. Yep! She says in [this video](https://youtu.be/i53HP7b23A0?t=698) from 11:38 - 12:22. But I would watch the whole video since it has great info about tret. What do you mean?

There's a link in the sidebar to determine your skin type. There's different categories like balanced, sensitive, oily, dry, dehydrated and combination. Based on the descriptions of each, mine pretty squarely falls into "balanced" with occasional oiliness. Yes that's the order. I personally put the night cream on first since apparently you're "supposed to" wait 20 - 30 minutes after applying tretinoin to apply your moisturizer. 

I personally don't think it matters to much whether you do it before or after. I usually wait for my face to dry before putting on the tret. Putting a moisturizer on first supposedly buffers the tretinoin and reduces irritation. But I really don't think it makes too much of a difference either way. FWIW, I found the CVS PM Moisturizer to be a decent dupe. Cerave used to be owned by Valeant and I believe the line was purchased by L‚ÄôOreal (go figure). Rumor was that they changed the ingredients. L‚ÄôOreal‚Äôs reply was that they ‚Äúupdated the ingredient list to reflect blah blah something‚Äù more accurately. Caused a tiny uproar in the derm/beauty community.  Sad because Cerave made the best stuff. A lot of people recommend Cetaphil as an alt. I dislike the lack of ceramides and niacinamide. You can buy it online in the US for around $20 Awesome! Im on tret too :) does it emulsify well? Which filters does it have? Have you ever tried Elta MD? Or DRMTLGY? Or how does the finish compare to any other SPFs you‚Äôve tried? So true! It completely transformed my skin. I just ordered the Shea Butter Lemon one! Came here to say how much I love the Jack Black lip balm. If you haven‚Äôt totally given up on the flavors I recommend either the Shea Butter or Lemon ones. No minty tingle & I swear somehow the lemon is even more moisturizing. Just ordered the Shea Butter Lemon! I just ordered the Shea Butter Lemon one! I bought it lmao Thank you ^_^ Yep that‚Äôs how I use it now. I used it as an additional night moisturizer when I had a damaged skin barrier though. I‚Äôd pat in on gently over my whole face so that it wasn‚Äôt too thick. Not OP, but it's shiny

[https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/hx1un2/riemann\_p20\_kids\_spf\_50/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/hx1un2/riemann_p20_kids_spf_50/) It's like a thick moisturizer with a radiant, but not greasy finish. It leaves the slightest white cast and grabs a little onto facial hair. It's kind of like LRP's Ultra Cream, if you're familiar with it. Wow! This makes me feel better, I use like 3 products a day and was self conscious. Still trying to find that oerfect combo though like you lol I would say tret can do the job of an exfoliant, vitamin c, and niacinimide, hydroquinone and even act as an anti fungal prevention once the fungal is cleared up.


Quick question, do you use the tret cream or gel? How do you apply it with facial hair in the way? Do you just keep rubbing it in until you feel like it‚Äôs absorbed? Thanks for the reply ! I see spray for spf 50 but liquid for the kids version ! I‚Äôll keep searching though Any comperations with LRP shaka fluid spf50, I found this sunscreen is totally fine on my skin but some people said its a little bit shiny for them. I also used the Altruist spf50 cream and I felt like if I can tolerate the shine of Altruist, I can tolerate all the awful texture of others. Thank you so much for your prompt reply grandpa milk! I was actually just looking at the riemann p20 sunscreen a few days ago, but to ship to the US it was 38$ (for the 200ml)

If you are in the US please recommend where I could purchase it! But glad it‚Äôs more simple now [deleted] Interesting. Thanks so much for your reply. i wana know your list of products! please share? i mean, a lot of the pure chemical form like the ordinary products ARE really good but idk if theyre necessary. I feel like skin care is such a new thing in the society that we wont know for sure if itll benefit us in the future or not- and the only thing is, im afraid i would regret not slabbing on those products. ultimately tho, i really do like your minimalist product items but im just curious if anyone feels fomo like i do. I've never understood what "pilling" is. Can you explain? No pilling at all (but i only wear powder makeup on top) but will leave a film behind (instead of absorbing completely in the skin), which i assume is the assurance that THIS IS PROVIDING SERIOUS PROTECTION THAT WON'T BUDGE!! ..at least that's how I like to think about it xD Not OP but I've never had an issue with P20 pilling.

I use the Purito unscented for my day to day when most of my sun exposure is driving home from work and I use the P20 if I am going to be outside in direct sunlight for a while. I'm on tret and it has the strongest filters (and new school filters!) I could find. I love it. Oh no, I love the Purito! Do you know what the concerns are based on?? I just got Purito unscented and love it. Lab Muffin liked it as it has 2 types of Uvinul.  If I am in heavy sun though I use Ducray Meleascreen Light Cream (nothing light about it. With masks it's all a bit weird anyway! The Purito differs in 3 major ways: filters, finish, and waterproof-ness.

The Purito has a superior finish. It's less shiny, more dewy, and completely invisible. I prefer it over the P20 finish.

Otherwise the P20 is superior. It has a stronger UVA protection with more reliable filters. Plus it's also water/sweat-proof which means it's will stay on all day. Nope! Less than $2 per tube. The cheapest thing in my routine. Definitely underline your last point. I was given tretinoin 0.1% in Mexico and I incorrectly used it. Damaged my skin like no other and now I'm babying it back alive to try and get it back to what it was before using tretinoin. Be sure to do research, try other alternatives first and not be dumb like me! ? 

Scientists do know why it works. Again, it is one of the most well-researched ingredients in skincare. Didn't know about it. I would love to try it because my biggest problem are the black pores, not the pimples.

EDIT: but I guess I would have to wait because I'm about to start with The Ordinary Lactic Acid. üòÖ honestly im a bit worried about things that work that well without solid reasoning I want to add it for brightening and for extra protection against photoaging.

I've made an exact dupe of Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. Whenever I use it consistently, my skin looks even, bright and glowing.

It's definitely super extra, but I personally like it a lot. Definitely prioritize a good cleanser, moisturizer and SPF first. Then tret since it's so effective. I know. It's so frustrating.

I'd recommend trying the P20! It's not the cheapest option, but it's still a great price for the UVA protection, even with shipping costs. As anything "stronger" in skincare, it can be harmful if you don't know how to use it. You HAVE to use sunscreen with tret and moisturizer, it can really dry out your skin. I haven't had any side effects, but a lot of people experience extreme dryness and peeling in the beginning months. There's also the purge. It's available in many countries OTC as well. But you often see many people fucking up their skin with OTC acids all the time, like on this sub even quite often. This one you can get over the counter, I bought the same one! As I understand it, the main risk of tretinoin is possible harmful effects on the fetus in pregnant women.
See here:
https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/tretinoin-topical.html

So in Europe when prescribing this the doctor ideally will make very sure there is no current pregnancy as well as use of contraception going forward, because the main harmfullness would be before the pregnancy is even known. 
(Edit: Actually that is the protocol for when it isotretinoin is taken internally, not sure whether the same for topical tretinoin) 

Also recommended against while breastfeeding. If you're in or near Mexico, It's OTC there and very cheap. The one OP has costs about 2 dollars for 40 grams and it's 0.05%. i saw that the one for adults had alcohol in it. it's probably bad for my dry/oily combination skin right? This is incorrect. Vitamin C is sensitive to sun, but it does not cause sun sensitivity. It has been shown in studies to help block the effects of UVA which is why the AAD and the skin cancer foundation recommends that you apply it during the day. Studies also suggest that it can increase the effectiveness of your SPF. Amazon has been facing some counterfeit issues lately Yeah it does! I have way fewer breakouts and CCs. I think it‚Äôs a little too gentle to be your only active (I‚Äôm about to start curology to help), but it would probably be great as an addition to tret that won‚Äôt completely dry you out or irritate you. I was able to start using it every day right from the get-go. Europe.. Thank you!!! :))) Oh my goood, I'm soooo jealouuus!!!! :O here the closest thing to it is Paula's choice 1% cream and it's like 60$ and not even that good xD :''( Thanks! I just watched that video. I think I'm gonna increase slowly to 4-5 times a week soon and see how it goes. I've been using tret 3 times a week for quite long, and I feel like my skin has adjusted enough. Still dry and peeling a bit if I don't moisturize enough, but other than that no irritation anymore. Thank you for the kind response! You are so awesome thank you for replying and for all the info ! I was more so talking about the, "Fitzpatrick Type III" but after a quick google search I now know what that means. The niacinamide is one my suspects, unfortunately. But I think it was also in the old formula. Maybe the strength changed? I dunno. For almost a year anything with "3 essential ceramides and niacinamide!" is causing similar irritation, and that's in *everything* so something is weird with my skin.  A bummer because I seriously loved the Cerave PM. Where online can you get the tret for $20? I want to try it but I really can't afford the prescription price. Thanks! Could you DM me your link, please? I use this too and it is the best! I was so nervous as someone with oily skin that it would Kevlar me greasy. With water it immediately turns this milky white color and rinse off. It leaves my skin feeling really clean, not dry and night but not at all oily. I‚Äôm honestly tempted to not even use cleanser after. I wear sunscreen and several other skincare products plus a whole face of makeup during the day and cetaphil cleanser was never enough to get everything off, this did the trick fast. I also like how I don‚Äôt have to scrub my eyelashes to get mascara off with this, I feel like they don‚Äôt fall out as much now. Emulsify as in rinse off? Yes, it rinses off well. Maybe 2 passes of water if you're rinsing in the sink. It has Uvinul A Plus, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, and Tinosorb A2B.

I've tried EltaMD, but it was a long time ago (2013) when I first got into skincare. I liked it but it was expensive.

The finish on the P20 is admittedly not the best. It's a bit shiny, but not so much that I'm afraid to go out in public. I can be easily mitigated with some translucent powder. The best finish I've encountered is the Purito Centella Unscented. It makes my skin look better. The only reason I don't use it is because it only has 2 filters, which many people are skeptical of. I'd rather use a strong sunscreen with multiple filters and sacrifice some cosmetic elegance. I just ordered the Shea Butter Lemon one! You do you! I hope you like it. You really only need a good cleanser, a good moisturizer, and a good SPF. Everything else is extra. (But I do recommend tretinoin!) I use the cream. It sinks in really fast. I don't bother with under my beard. [Here's a link to the one I purchased.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B083M2RBFS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I find LRP Shaka greasy as well. So is Altruist SPF50 (pilling issue) $38 is not too bad for 200ml. That's cheaper than Purito Centella Unscented per ml. Yes, definitely. It's just that I prefer SPFs, cleansers, and moisturizers from other brands.

Don't get me wrong I still like the ordinary. In fact, in my comment explaining my routine, I mention that I plan on incorporating that AHA/BHA peel. I personally love it and would recommend it. It's also inexpensive and unlikely to cause any adverse effects. You can see all my current products in the initial comment I made on this thread

EDIT: Sorry, I didn't see the context to your comment. What products are you talking about? All the products I've tried? Or just my current ones? >but idk if theyre necessary

They are not. If you are eating well and taking care of your body, and the biology of your skin is in balance, then your skin will take good care of itself. Your human body is a machine that has endless multiple systems working together at the same time. It's when things get out of balance that things go wrong, especially when not eating a diversity of foods so that the billions of types of bacteria in your gut is enabled to get what it needs by what you eat. The more out of balance things get, the more you will see problems, and not just with your skin.

There are plenty of humans around the world who have beautiful skin and don't use skin care products. Companies want your money and will tell you things that make you think you need them. You don't. 

Even using soap at all changes the microbiome of your skin.

Read about the new book 
Clean: The New Science of Skin: by James Hamblin. Absolutely! It means that after you apply it, the product balls up on your skin, so it looks like you have little flecks of product all over your face. With some products, I found that you can avoid this by carefully patting it on, but some are determined to pill regardless. That's really good to know, especially since I would plan to layer it with light makeup. Hey, I'm all about the protection! My mom's been wearing sunscreen religiously since her 20s, and now she's in her 60s yet regularly gets mistaken for still being in her 40s. It's worth the investment for sure! Thank you!! Are you me? üßêüßêüßê This is great to hear, thank you so much! I think I'm going to give P20 a try after reading so many good things about it. Yeah, I've also been using Purito during the day, but I work from home so it's mostly just to mitigate any potential damage from sunlight through windows. I love it, too! I can't find a definitive answer one way or another, so I can't comment with certainty on how accurate the claims are, but there have been multiple threads casting doubt upon its efficacy in this sub. :( 

It's something about the filters potentially not being effective or strong enough to provide reliable coverage. Some say it's fine while others say it's questionable, which is why I've been looking into other options just in case. My suspicion is that Purito is probably sufficient for day-to-day use when you don't anticipate a lot of sun exposure, but maybe get something stronger otherwise. Don't worry. K Sunscreens have to be tested, and it does provide the protection labeled.... They even uploaded their tests online. Also: Labmuffin made a post explaining how more or less filter doesn't necessarily means more or less protection.
Also most people using it seem to be fine :) Does it sting if you get it in your eyes? Is the p20 mineral or chemical based? I havent heard of it until this post. I have heard of the unscented purito one and I always hesitate buying it because I want to find something better for days of going outside for a couple hours. [deleted] In what way you used it? How did it damage your skin? How were you using it? Thinking of starting so I'm curious. Are the black pores Sebaceous Filaments moreso than blackheads? They are so difficult to treat in some cases. I‚Äôm using leave on topical salicylic acid, and fortnightly doing salicylic acid peels to help them. Try BHA, it‚Äôs the only acid I‚Äôm aware of that can get into your pores. Otherwise you‚Äôre just treating the surface of your skin. 
I get clogged and have had SF and blackheads my whole life, Salicylic is the only thing that‚Äôs worked. There's TONS of research on Tret as well as long term studies with people who use it everyday for over 10, 20, 30 years.

ETA: there's definitely a reasoning behind it, mainly quick cell overturning. Some quick Google scholar search should be enough to find those There is plenty of solid reasoning behind it. It was invented and used since the 1960s I did notice a slight brightening effect too. Thanks for the reply! I ordered mine through Cloud 10 Beauty. They were charging like $27/$28 a bottle and the shipping was only like $4. I was shocked. It came from Ireland and got to me in NY in about a week. It's a nice big bottle too so I didn't think it was a bad price. I will admit that I'm bad and don't do a lot of research about price/mL. Thank you Can you give a link please? Tried to do a search but couldn't find it Where do you get it?? Thanks for your reply! 
Guess it's like with retinol, but stronger. Keep in mind not all alcohol is drying, fatty alcohols like the kinds found in lip balms and face moisturizer are hydrating. Eh, I use sunscreens with alcohol with no problems. They are still plenty moisturising because of the oil-soluble filters. There is debate about that - some experts and companies recommend nighttime use (see quote below) because of irritation that increases photosensitivity. It may vary by formulation, with some being more potent and irritating than others. In addition vit C oxidizes and degrades in the presence of uv light so though it may increase the spf of your sunscreen it can‚Äôt do other things as well during the day as at night. It stays in skin for a few days after application, so if i use vit c (i don‚Äôt anymore but did for many years) I feel it‚Äôs better to play it safe and use at night (and use a good quality high spf sunscreen during the day). 

‚ÄúNow hang on a minute - if you have sensitive skin, you might want to steer clear of vitamin C serum during daytime hours. In some cases, higher concentrations of vitamin C could make sensitive skin more prone to irritation and sunburn. If your skin tends to be reactive to products that contain retinol and similar ingredients, we recommend using your vitamin C serum as a PM-only product.‚Äù
- https://www.100percentpure.com/blogs/feed/vitamin-c-serum-for-day-or-night

also, not that i think very highly of the skin cancer foundation but this is what they say about it: 
‚ÄúBrighteners like vitamin C may decrease the melanin in your skin, which acts as a natural defense against the sun‚Äôs rays. These may cause photosensitivity and increase your chances of damage from UV exposure. Being diligent about sun protection is crucial while using these products.‚Äù  
- https://www.skincancer.org/risk-factors/photosensitivity/ Hm. Ok. Mine seems fine, but if your find a more trustworthy retailer let me know. [removed] Someone pointed out my response violated the rules so I deleted it. Sorry everyone! I see. I notice that p20 claims to protect you for like 10 hours or something like that? Do you think that‚Äôs true? Or just marketing? I notice there are a few spfs out there, mostly European, that claim this. Sounds too good to be true lol Whats that do? Tretinoin!? Okay thank you :) oops i didnt realize youre OP. yes i agree less is more and the products u have are solid. but how come you took out micellar water and snail thing? The snail thing I never tried but so hyped in Korea- it's no good? i agree thanks for sharing. marketing gimmicks and youtubers who make me feel fomo- not worth it. ill be saving so much $$. Ah, I see. I've never had that problem with P20. But then again I don't wear makeup, so maybe that is a factor to consider. I put it on my eyes and have had no issue. It's chemical. The filters are Uvinul A Plus, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, and Tinosorb A2B. Mexico! Indeed! I was given it randomly and the directions were in spanish. I used it like a moisturizer for two weeks. Made my skin over sensitive, large pores, blackheads and my skin feels thin There are several websites you can order prescription tret through. I use Curology (US, not sure if they are international). Try r/tretinoin for more links if you‚Äôre outside of the US. I‚Äôve had a great experience so far with Curology and definitely recommend it. If you're in or near Mexico, It's OTC there and very cheap. The one OP has costs about 2 dollars for 40 grams and it's 0.05%. FWIW its against rule #2 of the sub to post about how to get Rx drugs w/o a prescription. Mexico Hey there is a Tretinoin subreddit that can help answer some of your questions Just chiming in to say that the p20 that‚Äôs like an oil absolutely reeks of booze. I found it super harsh on my face Thanks so much! I'll check it out. I did not intend to violate any rules asking for a link/store. Sorry. I think that's just marketing. I'm guessing like any sunscreen the efficacy will start to taper off over time. I'm guessing they mean that over 10 hours you wi still have SOME protection. Definitely not full protection. I would still reapply like regular sunscreen.

That being said, I was in the desert over the weekend, only applied SPF in the morning, and had 0 redness, tan or burn. I was also wearing a broad rimmed hat, so I'm sure that helped too. It's a strong topical vitamin A. It increases cell turnover in your dermis and reverses photodamage. It's usually a prescription drug iany countries and improper use can result in redness and flakiness.

Please take what I say with a grain of salt since I'm not a dermatologist. Just make sure to see your doctor before starting tretinoin. The micellar water with the cotton pads was too rough and harsh on my face. I find that an oil cleanser is much more gentle because there isn't so much friction. I also don't wear makeup so just the oil cleanser is sufficient.

I did like the snail mucin for the texture, but I didn't really see any major difference so I scrapped it. For me, just one moisturizer works well and I don't feel the need to supplement it. But I can see it being useful for people with a damaged moisture barrier.

I think a lot of companies are very good at marketing their products and ingredients, and consumers usually buy into it and sing its praises. You really don't need a while bunch of products. Awesome, thanks for the quick response! It sounds like it's probably fine, then. Whenever I've had that issue, you can tell even without putting on makeup. I appreciate the recommendation! Pilling is also almost always a result of your skin not being able to absorb the product, because it already is saturated with other stuff You poor thing! I use 0.025% and it's taken me awhile to work up to using it every other day, even while buffering with moisturizer. I started with twice a week for 2 weeks, three times a week for 3, and I'm working my way up. 

If anyone wants to start tretinoin, I highly recommend starting with a low dose and gradually working your way up with application. Moisturizer and SPF are vital! You may be able to work other actives into your routine later but start with a simple routine. The tretinoin subreddit is full of valuable information. I have very sensitive skin and though it would never work for me but it's been a few months now and my skin has transformed. Patience and going slow is the key. I‚Äôve tried Curology. Can I request them to prescribe me tretinoin? My last formula didn‚Äôt contain it Everyone in Mexico must have glorious skin. So jealous that they don't have to jump through hoops! Does it have a different name in Mex? Or do we just ask for 0.05% Tretinoin at a dermatology pharmacy? Oh sorry I thought they said it wasn't prescription Tretinoin isn't prescription in many countries though its OTC. Can you pm me their reply? In an earlier comment you mentioned only applying 1 pump of the sunscreen on your face. I use the same sunscreen during summer but always put 2 pumps since that‚Äôs what my 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon measures, which is the recommended amount. I‚Äôm always confused about the correct amounts, so do you think 1 pump is sufficient? You sound like an ad lol, I bad skin for the longest time and I am finally investing in my skin care, so thank you so much! ok thats good to know!! appreciate it!! This, absolutely. I use La Roche Posay Anthelios sunscreen, and it used to pill a ton with my old routine using several serums in the a.m. Now I just cleanse, moisturize and spf, and it‚Äôs sooo much better. yes you can. I did last month. The generic, cheap one is called "Tretinoina", you find it at Farmacias Similares. Brand name RetinA can be found in all other pharmacies and is about 20 dollars. no worries! I just saw several people commenting on it so just thought I'd share Could you pm ME the reply? :) I think so. It seems like a lot to me. But I've never measured. Start simple! Just find a cleanser, moisturizer and SPF that work for you. Oh okay. I wish I didn‚Äôt cancel my subscription üòî now I have to pay another $25. Seriously though I love the simplicity of Curology and I love their moisturizer (the light one) and I wish they would make it available for purchase without subscription :( honestly I don't love paying $20 a month and will probably find an alternative soon. Only using the curology for the tret. I stopped subscribing when my skin started feeling better and when I found a cheaper alternative. My formula contained 4% azelaic acid and I found The Ordinary‚Äôs Azelaic to have a higher concentration (10%) so I got that instead and it worked for me. Still on the hunt for a moisturizer that‚Äôs close to Curology‚Äôs formulation though. yeah they have 0.05 tret, 9 or 10% azalaic, and clinda i mine. I don't buy the moisturizer though I use a diff one. Their moisturizer is really underrated. My roommate and I share a bathroom, and a skincare shelf! Unfortunately, there's not room for everything I use. Some of these are my roommate's, so I don't really have a review of everything here.

*Edit:* [Here's a skin pic for reference!](https://i.imgur.com/TaePr1T.png) (including a healing pimple on my chin that would have been fine if I didn't pick at it üôÑ)

*Edit 2:* The shelf was from Wayfair but unfortunately is out of stock! There are similar ones on Amazon! (Will link when I‚Äôm not on mobile) I love that shelf!  This self was at my local Marshall‚Äôs for $25 right after Xmas. Went back the next day to get it and it was gone :‚Äô( I love these shelves. I have two of those same plants!  Any chance you know where the shelf is from? I love it! insert obligatory 'a e s t h e t i c' comment here You are so trusting, OP. I'd be checking my bottles everyday to see if anything was used up.  I love how easy it is to read your reviews. Thanks for setting it up in this way!  Hey what vitamin c serum do you use?? And when or how often do you use niacinamide? Where did you get that shelf? I need it!! Do you like the hydroboost? I absolutely hate it, it left a icky film on my face! I've just started using that COSRX cleanser. It makes my face feel a little tight before moisturising but I'm hopeful it'll be good for me and not break me out! Sooo this is cute OP! I noticed a lot of people asking for this shelving and I want it too so I searched and found it in a diff color [here](https://www.worldmarket.com/product/round+wood+and+metal+mateo+wall+storage.do)
I like the black like OPs more though Was wondering what does the Vitamin C in Silicone do to you? I have a combination skin too. Forget the products,I'm in love with your shelf! Love it so much - the shelf, the plant. Perfect! Adorable shelf! I have the CVS brand of that neutrogena water gel - I LOVE IT The lineage sleeping mask is soooo awesome  Hey! Question for you. How did you decide to cleanse then exfoliate then tone? I‚Äôm still trying to get a routine down.  Do you think microneedling is necessary?

Because I have been wanting to try it but I'm.not here if I need it or if it's going to work?
Do you have to have a skin issue for it to work?

I love your skin pic by the way!

Also, what does the Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel do? SO cute!
 I have been noticing that people don't wash their face with cleanser in the morning.

May I ask why? Since you also only use micellar water?

And is it the same for makeup and non makeup wearing folks! I‚Äôm here for everyone oooing and ahhhhing over the shelf! This would make a beautiful bookshelf. Definitely saving the picture for future purposes.  wow we have a very similar skin type and my hair is almost the same as yours so that pic freaked me out for a bit. I don't have a set routine yet but I'm definitely gonna take some inspiration from your routine! (I'm really new to the sub) Is the  hydroboost unscented? I was looking at it as a dupe for Clinique moisture surge.  Love the products on your shelf! What is that Daughter of the Land? It's very pretty!
 This is so satisfying! THAT SHELF IS GOALS Fake plant twins!!! That cosrx honey ceramide cream yessss üòçüòçüòç For those of you who went looking for this awesome shelf (like I did) and the Wayfair one is out of stock, some similar options on Amazon! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FY7N9PF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_gsfyCbKFHXRA0 I loooove that laneige sleeping mask Thank you :) This post inspired me so much that I bought a wood bamboo bathroom shelf on Amazon right after I saw this post.  I love Amazon Prime!  Drunk Elephant??? Oooh...so y‚Äôall are RICH RICH?! can someone help me pinpoint the ingredient in corsx low ph good morning cleanser that dries out my skin? Thank you!!!  are you suffering any scars? if yes, did microneedling help? May I ask what‚Äôs the difference between using a vitamin c serum and the Ordinary‚Äôs Vitamin C suspension? Does microneedling hurt? Any advice for a newbie who is looking to get into it?  I absolutely must have this shelf. Where‚Äôd you get it? Can I ask where you purchased the microneedler? I've been eyeing the Honey Ceramide Moisture Cream for a long time now. Have you found its moisture content to be sufficient on its own in winter, or only in combination? Great routine! I struggle with picking too. What sheet masks do you like? Hey! I have a question about microneedling. I‚Äôve heard about it as a salon thing but I‚Äôm curious about the benefits of it and what exactly it is. I‚Äôve never looked into it! Hello! Had a question, hope that‚Äôs okay! Is your Sunday and Wednesday AHA/BHA routine for exfoliation? Just starting to learn about the benefits of AHA and BHA, and I believe I have similar skin to you/similar taste in products! What are your top 4 favourite products from this picture? What‚Äôs the purpose of the micellar water in the mornings? It it like a less oily double cleansing thing?  I just want to put lots of succulents on it! My friend has it and it‚Äôs great! I‚Äôve seen it at urban outfitters. Came to say the same thing!  A good deal at Marshall's is never available the next day  I saw two white and gold versions of this shelf at my TJ Maxx! Aw, I'm so sorry. I hate it when people pick up the personalities *I* want for the holidays. If you search for "round industrial shelf" on Amazon, there are some $20-$40 options What kind of plants are they?? [Here's a link!](https://www.wayfair.com/storage-organization/pdp/union-rustic-nieves-round-floating-wall-shelf-npqb1011.html) Unfortunately it's out of stock :( I have a larger version that I also purchased from Wayfair.  There are several different ones on their website if you just type in round wall shelf or round metal wall shelf in the search bar! :) Check out a Marshall/Homesense if you have one locally.  Urban outfitters have it where I am just about to comment the same thing when I saw your comment haha Oops! Forgot to write it. I use The Ordinary's Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone. It's definitely a little tingly, especially after microneedling!

I use the Niacinamide every morning. It's one of the products that I first started using and it made SUCH a difference in my skin texture that multiple coworkers commented on how nice my skin looked after only a week or two using it! Wayfair! It‚Äôs linked a couple comments above. 

I think we are all pining for that shelf lol It works great for me! I haven't had a problem with it at all yet! I have it too but I love it. Maybe you used too much? I only put a tiny bit over my whole face. I've noticed if you use too much at once it doesn't sink in and leaves a weird layer on top of my skin  It gave my cheeks a weird bumpy texture after using it. I tried it twice and it took a week to get rid of the bumpy texture both times.  completely dries me out too Exfoliating after toning would get rid of the toner The hydro boost is a great moisturizer for me and contains hyaluronic acid. I have sensitive skin and I like it, despite it having some fragrance (it smells nice but I generally don't like items with fragrance because they tend to irritate me sometimes). Thank you! Unfortunately, we can't paint or replace any fixtures in our bathroom, so we're trying to do what we can with what we've got!  Washing your face is actually disrupting to the skin and slightly strips it each time you do it, and water itself has a pH that's too high for the skin. I do a double cleanse every night so that I don't have to wash my face in the morning. If I feel like my skin needs refreshing, I just wipe it with a cotton pad soaked with a pH balanced hydrating toner.  I use the CosRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser after the micellar water in the morning! The Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel cream does have a scent. I didn't realize when I bought it at costco. It smells nice, but I don't generally like frangranced items because I have sensitive skin and things with fragrance irritate me sometimes. That said, I've been using it for a 3 weeks now (I only wash my face, and use 5% lactic acid 2-3x per week, and use this product once a day on my face) and my skin has been perfectly fine. If you get the Hydroboost for extra sensitive (or dry?) skin, that one's unscented. I haven't noticed any scent, but I'm honestly not super sensitive, so I may not be the best to answer that! The one for "dry skin" is unscented. I have combo skin and love it! That‚Äôs one of my roommate‚Äôs items! I don‚Äôt think she actually uses it very much. Definitely on the shelf for ~aesthetics- Haha I WISH! The D-Bronzi and Marula Oil are from one of their mini sets, so only $25 for the two. The Drunk Elephant C-Serum was actually a gift from a friend who used it once and it broke her out like crazy! No scarring, so I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not much of a help! I use it mostly for wrinkles and tightening up my skin  Depends on the serum, but most serums are a lot lighter and liquidy when you put them on and The Ordinary suspension in silicone is thicker, like a lotion. 

Chemically, I‚Äôm not too certain! I‚Äôm sure the makeup and percentages are different depending on which ones you choose Try urban outfitters online I have the same one but in silver and black from Cost Plus World Market. I got [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076YFSCCR/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon! I haven't used the serums/lotions that go with it, so I probably could've just gotten one without the add-ons. Happy cake day! I haven't used it alone yet - only in addition to the CeraVe Cream. It is very thick though, and I did see a definite change in moisture when I started using it in addition. I'm sure many others could help, because it's a product I got from recommendations on SCA! Lately I've been loving the [Garnier](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X93385V) and [Neutrogena](https://smile.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Moisturizing-Hydrating-Hydrogel-Hyaluronic/dp/B076H45H68/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=neutrogena+face+mask&qid=1549738318&s=beauty&sr=1-5) ones! I tried the snail jelly ones that everyone loves from amazon but they ended up being super pilly and felt weird after using them. I don't have a preferred brand and I'm always looking for new ones!

But yeah - I'm a HUGE skin picker, especially when my anxiety gets worse. I've found that having a skin routine has definitely helped because I don't want to mess with everything I just did to my face! It‚Äôs a skin heeling technique. Basically the needles scratch the top most layer of the skin which motivates the skin to start heeling itself. This constant skin heeling curbs wrinkle formation. Basically, you injure your skin purposely so that you don‚Äôt get wrinkles or sagging. Usually it‚Äôs preserved for people who are 25+ or those with compromised/low collagen 

Edit: forgot to mention it also helps with scar healing  Yep! Chemical exfoliation. I've been lurking in SCA for a couple of years now and I still feel like a beginner, but I've found that this is what works for me and definitely helps my skin texture! My skin now is dramatically smoother and has fewer pimples than when I started! I have the Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel and it's awesome! And I'm going to buy more The Ordinary products (I have the 5% lactic acid and I like it so far.. I use it 3x per week) GREAT question! 

1.	The Ordinary Niacinamide & Zinc
2.	Biore UV Aqua Rich Sunscreen
3.	Neutrogena Hydroboost Water Gel 
4.	CosRX Honey Ceramide Cream I use it for getting any residue off my face. Sometimes I just feel really greasy and dirty waking up! And then I cleanse after using CosRX A lesson learned the hard way. They‚Äôre artificial ones from IKEA Do you recommend/ see a difference using niacinamide in the morning versus night?  Awesome!!! That‚Äôs probably my issue! I never tried to use it again tbh, I‚Äôll dig it up and try that though, thanks! That happened to me with one of Milk's highlighters the other week :( I was devastated because I love their other products! Omg gross! Shame on them for selling that crap! Ohh.

This is all very new to me.

All my life I have been washing my face with cleanser and putting on moisturizer  every single day.

I usually have oil buildup on my nose so that's why I do it.

>I do a double cleanse every night so that I don't have to wash my face in the morning

How do you do a double cleanse, if you don't mind answering?

> I just wipe it with a cotton pad soaked with a pH balanced hydrating toner. 

Like the Thayer's Witch one?  What Hydrating toners do you recommend? There‚Äôs a few on the market I believe: Fresh has one, as does Dickerson‚Äôs :) I have tried Thayer‚Äôs Rose Toner but it dried me out üòë Ohh so you do use cleanser then Thanks. I think I‚Äôll try it when I run out of Clinique. I really like that one but I‚Äôm looking for something more affordable and similar.  how depth is your needling? But it still has the same effects as a vitamin c serum right? If it does I might go with the Ordinary since most serums cost too much. Thank you üòä Cool thanks! I'll have to check those out cause I like a lot of your products :)

Same it really sucks and I definitely agree. One of the most important things for me is to also only use very dim lighting in my bathroom at night (a pretty string of lights and/or a candle if I'm feeling extra). [removed] Do you need to have clear skin to use it?  Do you find that the chemical exfoliation has helped with any scarring? I've never used it at night, because I normally do my serums and actives at night, and niacinamide reacts with some of them. I keep it in the morning just to avoid any reactions! Honestly I really like hydro boost and it‚Äôs been consistently great to me. Idk, it‚Äôs not crap just because it did not work for you.  A double cleanse, specifically oil cleansing method is where you use an oil cleanser first on a dry face to break up and dissolve makeup, sunscreen, etc then follow up with a gentle cleanser to remove any excess residue. 

Thayer's is like a degreaser, a hydrating toner is a gentle pH balanced liquid with no harsh actives. I use a few Japanese toners, mainly Hada Labo. Hydrating toner is mostly sold in the Asian skincare markets.  [removed] PSA from a concerned esthetician- STOP USING MICRONEEDLE ROLLERS.  You shouldn't ever microneedle (at home or professionally) over active breakouts because it will pop and spread all of the bacteria around your entire face.  Not necessarily. its really up to you.

The micro needling injuries are so small they don‚Äôt even leave any blood behind or anything. If you see early signs of aging or discoloration you can use it. You can also have completely clear skin and just want to prevent future signs of aging. Make sure you disinfect the micro needle after each use because bacteria might get in and cause break outs. I didn‚Äôt have much scarring to begin with, but it definitely has helped smooth out my skin texture! I also had a lot of sun damage and it has helped immensely with that Lol sorry if you took offense!üòÇ >A double cleanse, specifically oil cleansing method is where you use an oil cleanser first on a dry face to break up and dissolve makeup, sunscreen, etc then follow up with a gentle cleanser to remove any excess residue. 

Oh
So if I use Cerave Hydrating Cleanser (for Normal to Dry skin)....does that count as oil cleanser?

Or should I use the Foaming Facial Cleanser (for normal to oily skin)
** I have combination skin**

>etc then follow up with a gentle cleanser to remove any excess residue.

Any suggestions?

>Thayer's is like a degreaser, a hydrating toner is a gentle pH balanced liquid with no harsh actives.

Reccomendations? Or the one you use perhaps? Please elaborate omg  How do you feel about dermaneedling? 

Specifically this if you‚Äôve heard anything about it? https://dermaroller.owndoc.com

It‚Äôs expensive but from the reviews I was reading and the macro photos of the tears rollers cause this seemed like it would be worth saving up for if I was going to do anything like this.  Thank you for the answer! Looking forward to trying it >So if I use Cerave Hydrating Cleanser (for Normal to Dry skin)....does that count as oil cleanser?

No, those would be the 2nd stage, or "gentle cleanser!" 

You've probably never used an oil cleanser before. Options include products from Biossance, Clinique Take The Day Off Balm or Oil, Boscia, Paula's Choice, Shiseido, Kopari, Burts Bees, Bare Minerals... The terms to search for are "cleansing oil" or "cleansing balm." Thank you! [deleted] I have dull dehydrated skin, with some cc's around my cheeks/jawline and chin.  Hyperpigmentation, PIE/ tons of redness and scarring!

AM:

Wash with Cerave Foaming cleanser, pat dry.

Splash face with Thayers Rose Petal toner.
Witch I don't feel does anything, but its refreshing lol.


TO's Vitamin C suspension 23%.
(I let this dry and brush my teeth, cause this STILL stings me.. But I still love it.  Its boosted my radiance)

Then after I wash my hands from the toothpaste lol, I dip my fingers into my Cerave Moisturizing cream and drop 3-4 drops of my Tea Tree Oil (just generic organic walmart stuff I picked up on sale for 4 bucks, deaaals. ) and mix it with the tips of my fingers, from my other hand. Before gently rubbing into my face. 
I feel like the tea tree oil really helped some uncontrolled break out and some of my cc's 

I usually wait a little bit before applying Neutrogena Hydroboost Sunscreen spf 50. (I forgot to throw that in the picture. Its on the other side of my bathroom lol).
Then wait 15-20 mins before applying my makeup.

PM:

Usually double cleanse with Cerave, to get all of my eyeliner and mascara off. Pat dry.

Thayers Toner. 

5-6 drops ofTO's Niacinamide 10% + Zinc.
Wait until dry. I loooooovvveee this stuff so much. Its taken so much of my redness away. If they ever stop making this, Ill cry a river and drown myself in it. Not. Kidding. üôäüôä
 
Cerave Moisturizing Cream with 3-4 drops Tea Tree. Unless its Monday or Friday then I sub the Tea tree with TO's Lactic Acid 10%. Which has definitely helped with some textural problems by my dimples.

Last I layer my regular old generic rosehip seed oil on top which I think has boosted my glow as well! And I'm ready for bedüåàüåàüåª.

Still haven't incorporated TO's peel yet. Not gunna lie a little scared haha! But slow and steady wins the raceüòÄüòäüí™. Also waiting for their hyaluronic acid serum in the mail as we speaküòÄ to help with some more hydration.

THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR OPENING MY NAIVE EYES TO SKINCARE! I cant wait to see what my skin looks like in a couple more months!
 
Edit:  I totally forgot about my little blue miracle tub of blistex Lip medex. This is one of my HGs since middle school. I slather this stuff on right before bed and right after my AM routine. And my lips never get dry or chapped, I really feel like it keeps you super moist throughout the day. Ahhh. I want that ordinary peeling solution but I can‚Äôt find it in Canada and I can‚Äôt find a place online that will ship to Canada... including amazon. 
Does anyone know how I can get this? I like that your routine is simple. I often see "shelfies" with dozens of different products that couldn't possibly all be in regular use. I've found that simplifying my routine as much as possible has helped me actually stick to it and achieve better results. I also have PIH and I'm using a similar regimen as you, but I have noticed an improvement with the addition of TO's granactive retinoid serum. I use it underneath the Vit C suspension! Imo the CeraVe hydrating cleanser works better for my dehydrated and dry prone skin. Feels so soft afterward with CeraVe in the tub.  Wow we have REALLY similar skin and products. In the evenings I use the Cerave foaming cleanser, Thayers, then 3x per week I use TO 5% lactic acid, then TO caffeine syrum, TO Buffet serum, and Cerave tub moisturizing cream. This has been my routine for a few months and so far no breakout or anything with this period!! I'm pumped.

In the morning I use buffet and the caffeine serum, then Neutrogena clear skin spf 55 under my makeup! I'm using TO liquid foundation right now too, which is pretty good and very light!
 I just found the ordinary and went on a shopping spree! Seeing this right after means it was meant to be! I'm so excited and I'm glad you're getting great results. They really need to redesign the cap on the Thayers witch hazel. That fucker broke within a month. Ughhh I WISH that CeraVe cleanser worked for me. It broke me out BADLY, I think it was the ceramides. 

Also, really random, but thank you for showing your affordable routine! It can be really disheartening to see Sunday Riley and Drunk Elephant all the time :)  this looks so much neater and how mine should look but doesn't because I have a bunch of so-so products I don't use much but also don't want to throw out :( Is cerave good? I saw it a few times on here so assuming it is.  Does the Neutrogena Hydroboost SPF 50 sunscreen sting? I have been having issues with chemical sunscreens lately where they hurt sooooo badly :( hi op! plz tell us your skintype and routine :)  Hey there! So I‚Äôve been struggling with dull, dehydrated skin too, with some CC‚Äôs hanging around my chin/jaw, and I‚Äôve been nervous to incorporate Vit C, tea tree oil or even rosehip oil. 
Which of the 3 did you notice helped with brightening the most? 
Which helped with your CC‚Äôs the most? 
I‚Äôve got this sneaking suspicion that my CC‚Äôs might be fungal and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to tackle that part since summer is coming up and I‚Äôm on the west coast.  Witch: burns the soul out of my skin after clean shaving. not sure if it does more harm or good. any one know? Yayayay!!!! You've gotta be over the moon! üòäüòä

Is it weird I sort of found the foaming wash to be a little drying? But, I think that may be because of what my dermatologist has prescribed to me.  I've tried and loved (mostly) all of the products her! I don't use tea tree oil, but all the others I have tried. I found the CeraVe cream to be a little thick which I'm fine with, but I feel like it leaves a film on my skin which I don't prefer. The peeling solution is probably my all time favorite product from TO. I usually notice a difference in texture the morning after I use it and I looove it lol. As someone else mentioned I think, it's nice to see a collection of products that don't break the bank and aren't Drunk Elephant, or Sunday Riley lol.  What‚Äôs the difference between cerave‚Äôs moisturizing cream vs lotion? Atm I‚Äôm using the lotion on my face, because I got it from Target sale a while back I‚Äôm such a fan of cost- effective and easy routines. Wow. Love! I have super dry skin and struggle with PIE acne scars too üò´ you said the Ordinary products helped you the most with this? Where do you buy that big bottle of witch hazel? Ooooh! I use that lib balm too!! It‚Äôs so awesome, used it ever since I was little.  Oh, I just bought The Ordinary Peeling Solution the other day, am yet to try it, what did you think of it? Did it improve your skin?  Thank you so much for posting this! Our routines are very similar, down to the brands and types; I‚Äôve been looking to add TO Niacinamide/Zinc for a while and you‚Äôve convinced me. 

Two questions:
1) Do you get yours straight from the Deciem website or do you recommend another provider?
2) How do you apply the 6 drops - just with your fingertips?

Thank you! This is very similar to my routine! I dont use the vitamin c or lactic acid and i use cerave pm instead of cerave in the tub. Dont be afraid to try the peeling solution, I use once a week. Random, but your choice of emojis made this post ten times better What does witch hazel do? Woah this looks eerily familiar. I guess it's almost like we frequent the same skincare resources haha I have been thinking about using TO‚Äôs products but how do I know which one is good for my skin? They have so many different products with different kinds of chemicals/acid in them. How did you know which one was good for you?  How much did your rose hip seed oil cost? TO has one for $10. 

Edit: also when do you use the lactic acid? Does it help with anything? Im waiting for my peeling solution to arrive any day now oh my god im so excited glad so many people seem to like it Hey there! Mind if I ask what witch hazel is used for? Is it used as a toner? I‚Äôm a long time lurker of this sub and have been seeing it everywhere! :p Do you use the foaming cleanser to take your eye makeup off? How does it do as a makeup remover? Doesnt it make your skin feel dry? Did you try the hydrating cleanser too? My dad looooves that Blistex. I feel like he‚Äôs had the same tub for 12 years, he always used to make me put it on before getting out of the car in the winter, and I used to think it was so ‚Äúspicy‚Äù and painful. I like the sensation now, though! I've got the same cleaner, toner, and moisturizer CeraVe and Thayers are on my shelf too! I've had that exact foaming cleanser for almost a full year and it's still not gone. I use it once a day minimum. It's amazing!!! How do you know which "the ordinary" products you should use? OK serious question.....where the heck do you get the Ordinary at? I am in small town USA and I cannot find it online! Someone help pleaseeee! You‚Äôre a blessing tysm Thank you!!! Oooh I'm looking for a new facial cleanser. I've been using Cetaphil for years because its so light. But I want to try to switch it up to something better. How is the cleanser from CeraVe? I've been reading about it a lot. Is it good for sensitive skin?  Where did you pick up your Ordinary products from? I‚Äôve been looking at Sephora but they‚Äôre always out of stock  Upvote and a thank you to make me realize I need to put my lip care on my shelf with my skincare products! It‚Äôs on my headboard and the plan is always to lather it on before I sleep but that never happens! Put mine in my cupboard last night and have soft, dewy lips this morning! üòç Thx for the help! Thank you‚ù§.

Im a stay at home mom, so affordability is a must for me! As much as I would lovveee to spend 80 bucks on a serum/lotion etc, Ive got diapers and other things to pay for! Lol 
 So true. I don‚Äôt have the $$ to spend $80 on 2oz of serum. And even if I did, I don‚Äôt know that I would. I also looove TO‚Äôs vitamin C suspension 23%. I‚Äôm a weirdo and I like the gritty texture. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  

I wish niacinimide + zinc worked a miracle for me, but all it does is make my face itch. Just a friendly tip- double cleansing doesn't mean cleansing twice with the sane type of cleanser. The point of double cleansing is to cleanse first with an oil based cleanser to get rid of sunscreen and makeup, the second cleanser is a water based cleanser like the Cerave which cleans off any grime and oil left over from step one. Cleansing twice with the same cleanser doesn't do anything positive, it just uses more product and strips your skin more! What does the vitamin c smell like? The vit c I'm using smells like hot dog water which is normal I've read, but I really can't handle it.  I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm pushing product but an oil cleanse or just using micellar water (as your AM and first PM cleanse) is really great for dehydrated skin! I find it helps my skin ‚Äúhold‚Äù better onto the good surface oils from my PM routine the night before so I don‚Äôt feel as dry during the day. It also effectively removes all my makeup so you won‚Äôt need to wash your face twice in the PM, which can be quite stripping. Of course feel free to ignore this if you‚Äôve already tried oil cleansing and it didn‚Äôt work for you! We have very similar skin types! I‚Äôve been using the CeraVe foaming wash for awhile and I like it, just used the CeraVe moisturizing cream last night, since I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a good moisturizing night cream, not sure how I like it. I feel like I need an oil or serum under it, but I can‚Äôt decide which one. üò£

Also been thinking about getting the Niacinamide + Zinc and the Thayer‚Äôs Toner. I‚Äôve been using the TO Peel for about a month and I‚Äôm liking it. Last time I used it, I used a hydrating sheet mask right after and that made me skin feel great, I suggest maybe trying that out whenever you eventually do incorporate it in! Hm I just realized maybe my niacinimide isn't working cause I only use 2 drops... Gonna increase and see if it makes a difference.  This is so helpful!! Thank you for writing what each of your products does for you üíï Just looking to clarify, is that already diluted tea tree oil that you have there?  Did the Niacinamide improve the hyperpigmentation? I've got a lot of that around my lips and wondering if I should invest in some niacinamide.  What are ccs around your cheeks? I just bought TO's Niacinamide 10% + Zinc, I follow their routine on their website for pigmentation (I use this in the morning and at night as my first step). How long did you notice a difference in your hyperpigmentation?? That's my main skin issue and I'm reeeaaallly hoping that it makes a difference! very similar to my routine and the to zinc has been great for me so far! i have been thinking about adding the vitamin c. what does it do for you? This is great! I think we have really similar skin, and seeing your process helped me understand my order of operations. 

* I really recommend trying out micellar water for an AM cleanse and to remove makeup at night before your PM cleanse; it made a huge difference for me. 
* Right now I'm experimenting with azaleic acid to deal with rosacea. TO's 10% did nothing for me and was pretty meh, which I've heard a lot of other people say, so I'm trying out a 15% cream [link](https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Formulas-Melazepam-Cream/dp/B001WUEJ4U) and I'm waiting to see if it makes a difference. I haven't tried out my bottle of TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc so I'm excited to hear how much you love it!
* I'm also starting to explore serums and stuff for hydration. I picked up a number of small travel size options at Sephora and I'm currently trying out Biossance's squalane oil. So far I haven't had a reaction and my hydration is definitely, visibly improved. This is so similar to my routine and has a lot of the same ingredients. I‚Äôm still working out the kinks though. I use hempseed oil (which I like) instead of rosehip, and I want to phase out my cerave moisturizer since it‚Äôs giving me cc‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt have anything from the ordinary, either  Omg OP! I have tea tree oil and rose oil just chillin in my house! I'm trying your night routine as we speak! Thank you! <3!!!

Edit: spelling. But seriously I'm so excited to see how my skin does with your night routine. Giddy excitement over here. Do you use a moisturizer between the TO Niacinamide+zinc and rosehipseed oil because of the reactions or another reason? I find if I do Niacinamide+ followed by Rosehipseed oil it pills really badly. Does the in-between step help? I must have gotten a bad batch of the Vitamin C suspension because I always read it stings people‚Äôs faces but it has never stung mine  How do you like your Ordinary products? The TO Lactic Acid burned my face so badly! How do you use it in your routine? I use only 1 drop of TO Niacinamide to cover my entire face. 5-6 drops? Wow. How many drops does all of you use for your serum? I reaaaally wish that neutrogena hydroboost sunscreen didn‚Äôt give me painful breakouts :(  > I have dull dehydrated skin, with some cc's around my cheeks/jawline and chin.

 You can get it from Beautylish, Beautybay or Cult Beauty. Try beautylish. shipping is a bit pricy but that is what I use for my hauls not available locally. I think Im gunna try that one next! Im almost out, I was just leaning more toward foaming at the time cause I was wearing allooottt of foundation to try and cover up my mess of a face LOL. And I was scared it wasnt going to get all that gunk off haha. Now that im barley wearing any foundation tho (crowd of screams!üåàüéâ) Ill definitely look into the hydrating! Thank you‚ù§ TARGET HAS SPRAY VERSIONS AND I WAS PISSED WHEN I FOUND IT LIKE RIGHT AFTER I BOUGHT IT! Lmao I feel your pain!!üòÇüòÇ I re-use an old setting spray bottle for mine and just spritz it on :) cuz fuck that lid. I bought a little glass spray bottle for mine, total game changer.  Elephants have no natural predators. However, lions will sometimes prey on young or weak elephants in the wild. The main risk to elephants is from humans through poaching and changes to their habitat. I use so-so products on my body. Great way to get rid of facial moisturizers that were a little meh.  Not OP, but Cerave is a favorite on this sub because their products (cleansers and moisturizers, predominantly) usually work quite well, are easily accessible in drugstores (at least in the US where I am, not sure where you are based), and are very affordable. Happy to answer any more questions if you have them! I promise I‚Äôm not a Cerave shill, I just really love their moisturizing cream üòÖ Cerave is generally know here as a good product that works for a lot of people. They have good face washes and moisturizers at decent prices. Unfortunately for me I bought a bottle awhile ago and it made me break out hard. I've been trying to find someone into skin care that will put it to good use  Try a Japanese sunscreen! I highly recommend Rohto Skinaqua Super Moisture Milk. It's my HG and I've tried tons of Neutrogena/other western brands :) I had the same issues. I switched to mineral sunscreens and it's been so much better. No stinging.

My current fave is DE Umbria Tinte. Me too! I just bought the new Cerave ultralight AM lotion 1.7 ounces, and it doesn‚Äôt sting and doesn‚Äôt have a white cast! I love it! Sorry my phone wouldn't let me post on the original posting so I had to comment it down below. And that was a mission with my two year old causing mayhem lol!
 Can you tell me what CCs are? Thanks! i have similar skin. 

for me, tea tree oil was too drying on my face. i use it on my scalp, though. i have not used vitamin c serum ‚Äî only because i have had so much success with other products. i use TO niacinamide and rose hip oil in my routine and they work wonders for me!! my skin will look bright and almost glowing. and, i can definitely tell when i skip a few days: Ohhh tough question lol.. 
All in all, Id say the Vitamin c helped the most with the all over brightening effect, I did incorporate the rosehip oil at the same time tho. Just because I read they benefit each other really well (and my skin isnt sensitive to oils so I didnt mind starting them at the same time).
Honestly tho I think the tea tree did the most for my cc's definitely. And especially if you think they might be fungal (which is what I thought about mine, especially on my cheeks), as tea tree oil has natural antifungal properties to it. But if you do use tea tree, make sure to dilute with an oil or moisturizer and go slow! 1 drop and slowly work your way up!üòÄ what witches do tho ? Not OP but I‚Äôm with you. the foaming cleanser felt soooo nice but it made my skin feel so stripped and tight afterwards, so I switched to a hydrating cleanser (Cerave makes one, but I personally use the La Roche Posay Toleriane). It really depends on your skin type!  Here* I believe moisturizers are more oil based so they stay on the skin a bit longer than lotions which are water based.. From what I get lotions are more hydrating while moisturizers are more moisturizing. (I cant tell you the exact difference though, that would be a great question to ask the daily question thread!) Most definitely. 
A tie between the Vitamin C and Niacinamide! I just saw your super dry, Im sorry. Make sure you moisturize if you decide to incorporate these, as ive seen that some people get itchy and dry from Niacinamide. I got mine on Amazon. what does it actually do though :? Target has them.  I've seen it in some pharmacies and Whole Foods! Sadly,
Ive been a little hesitant to try it. I love their products but I still feel like my skin needs more of an acid tolerance before I turn to it. Theres alot of recommendations tho, which is why i took the plunge lol. I order through Beautylish, they give great samples! Lol which is a plus if you like trying out new products. 

And when I apply it, I put it in the palm of my hand and take the finger tips from my other hand and start putting it all over. It does dry a little quick, forewarning. Then I pat my palm on my forehead or chin if I have any remaining product on my handüòä.

Edit: I forgot this sub is like international, so I dont know how well beautylish ships outside the US. I know they do, but idk if it takes longer?? I live in Colorado so I usually get it within 3 days.  Its a toner that you apply over your face prior to applying your serum and stuff. I pretty much live on this sub lmao, so I pretty much just did a lot of research on here. Looked at a lot of threads with people combating the same issues I was, looked at their products. 

Then Id go read the reviews on the websites that sold them, just so I can see and make sure the product helped most of the people writing the reviews.

I also asked aloooottttt of questions on here. Figured these people are here to help, and to take advantage of the daily questions thread. Everyone was super helpful. 

Then lastly when I got the product id patch test behind my ear for a few days (just to make sure it wouldnt cause more harm than good.)

Hope this helpsüíñ This one only costed me like 6 bucks at natural grocers (like trader joes or whole foods). 
I use the lactic twice a week, Mondays and Fridays and mix 3/4 drops into my moisturizer. I feel like the lactic helped the most with the textural problems I had around and in my dimples. I have both but I used the foaming cleanser for a year and I just bought the hydrating cleanser 2weeks ago. They both suck at taking off makeup but the foaming does a way better job.  However it always mad my face feel tight and as someone with dehydrated skin, that was a no. The hydrating cleanser is amazing and I'm mad that I've just started using it   Not OP but if you go on their website it will tell you which products do what! It will likely be a little trial and error. Some stuff has worked wonders for me and others I didn‚Äôt feel like it did much. But the stuff is so well priced, you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre wasting too much money trying things out :) From their [website](https://theordinary.com/). I got one of their products on Amazon. I would try the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser instead. The foaming one (in OP's pic) was a little too harsh for me. I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not alone in the itchy face reaction. I‚Äôm pretty sure it made me redder from the sun sensitivity and itching! I lasted 3 weeks and gave it up I like TO‚Äôs vitamin C suspension too, but the only problem is that I'm not so happy with it being oil based, cause it means I can't use any water based products when I use it. I would like to use Buffet under it, but I heard the vit c needs to be the first product used after cleansing. I mix the niacinamide with gel cream or moisturizer like a booster. That's the only way I can handle it and it works well. I like what both of these do to my skin long term but really struggle with what they do to my skin short term - I can't use them in the morning because the vit c makes my face greasy, and the niacinamide makes it sticky, even if I just use just a little Ohhh thank you! Didnt know that! Thank you everyone for the help! But one can double cleanse with the same cleanser, if it works at taking everything off as far as I've read. I think the actual phrase of double cleansing is actually meant to refer to two serparate cleansers though.  the hot dog water comparison is amazing.   we normally say something smells like butts if it smells bad but i think hot dog water might be worse/better!
 Oh my god, hahahah Im dying! Which brand are you using? TO's? I cant say that Ive smelled anything... Lmao no it smells like hot dog water most definitely. i used to use the Paula's Choice vit c booster and it is super hot doggy Hahaha great comparison!! I always say it smells like tanning beds or burnt skin. I hate it so so much.  I have always wondered why my vitamin C smelled like pork! Thank you for telling me it's normal.  I used Garnier Micellar water and my face was SUPER angry :( Do you have any suggestions for a more gentle brand? Oooohhh I actually havent and have been interested in trying it! I appreciate the advice, is their any oils that you'd especially recommend for someone just starting oil cleansing? Ive read amazing posts on hemp seed oil and the power of healing it has (ima serial picker so any healing powers help ha). I see so many people mention that the Thayer's witch hazel toner does nothing for them, but my skin is very much like OP's (and so probably like yours), and I seriously consider it an HG product.  I find it super hydrating, and I find it's been a huge factor in evening out my skintone and giving me a general tight "brightness".  

It's honestly not very expensive, so I think it won't hurt to try it, even if you fall into the "meh" camp.  I adore the stuff.  So I have a weird question that I don't know how else to ask, but... I recently bought this exact same CeraVe foaming cleanser... And it's not foamy at all. It looks like lotion, and it feels like lotion. No foam at all. But the label clearly says CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. It's been like that since I bought it new. Is that... Right? Or did I end up with lotion somehow? Thanks for the tip on the peel! I love my sheet masks so any excuse to get more is welcomeüòÇüòâ.
If we have similar skin types and your combating PIE and redness I would definitely try the Niacinamide, it really did wonders to my angry red face lol. But I wouldnt really recommend the toner... It doesnt do anything for my skin just makes me feel clean and refreshed. But if your going for that, it is really soothing lol I mix mine with rose hip seed oil. I use a drop in the morning and several at night. I‚Äôve mixed in hyaluronic acid as well but prefer the oil. I usually do one fat drop on each cheek, chin, and forehead. So 4 fat drops. Seems to work well and I get good coverage without feeling like I'm wasting any product. It isnt.. I mix it into my moisturizer to dilute it. Is that wrong? Lol I havent noticed any negative effects. My skin isnt very sensitive tho. I personally noticed a crazy difference in my hyperpigmentation. And it only took like 3/4 days to really start working and noticing the differences. I started using TO's Niacinamide about 2 weeks ago and the difference has been noticeable! My skin tone is slowly evening out and my pores look a lot better. It was def worth the investment for me :)  closed comedones, which are small, uninflamed (don't think that's a word but oh well) whiteheads for what it's worth I was using it at night for awhile with Vit c in the day - and I started notcing a difference when i swapped them (vit c pm, niacinamide am with TO Buffet)


 Def stay patient! My progress with it has been slow but steady :)  I seriously noticed it within 3/4 days! I dont know if my skin just really loved it, or what but I've never had results that quick!  I hope it works for you just as well! Definitely one of my favorites. Fingers crossed for you‚ù§ Before I started using the vitamin c, I looked very sickly and pale whenever I didnt wear makeup. I feel like its really helped give me a "glow" and all over radiance I never had lol 

Edit: I did add rosehip oil at the same time, since I read reviews that they benefit each other. So I cant say 100% that it was only the vitamin c. But I feel like it played the major role. I just thought that was the order to do it honestly lol.. But i havent had any pilling with it this way! Ive read that some people just have really tough skin and it doesnt effect them either! I wouldnt say you got a bad product, id lean more toward the fact you might have thicker stronger skin than me lol. I really love them! I mix 3-4 drops in with my moisturizer only twice a week thoüòä. Thank you so much! Just ordered from Beautybay and got free shipping. :)  do you know if they charge duties on these sites? i was thinking of trying cultbeauty but keep the order under $20 cdn I like it a lot. If you double cleanse with micellar water or a cleansing oil it works just fine on even the thickest makeup.  The spray versions cost the same  but you get less product,  I use a mist bottle from the travel section and just get the full size, non spray thayers. Dang I should look for those. I can't take the thing on trips because it would leak all over. Good bot. I remember reading somewhere the CeraVe moisturizing cream (tub) was only for the body. Are you able to use it on your face as well with your experience? Yeah I saw the products in my grocery store and almost bought them but wanted to get more reviews here before I made the purchase lol  I broke out bad from the pm lotion...I wish I didn‚Äôt because I hear so much good stuff about this brand. Yeah I heard about this too - breakouts. I think I will err on the side of caution then as I already have a good system going. I would hate to get visitors on my face as I‚Äôm super ocd about it lol  Does this leave a white cast? What is HG? Hm...I see zinc oxide...looks to be a physical sunscreen. I'm looking for chemical, thanks tho! I actually don't know if it's chemical or physical OOPS but I LOVE my Farmacy Green Screen sunscreen :) I want to use both physical and chemical to get the full amount of protection Hm...that looks to be a combination sunscreen. I'm looking for just plain chemical, thanks though!

Also...it has Niacinamide in it. I like to use my Vitamin C serum in the mornings and Niacinamide and vitamin c shouldn't mix :p  Closed comedones! ‚ò∫Ô∏è I think tea tree is drying for me too - I tried the Cosrx Low PH Good Morning Cleanser, which has tto in it, and my face dried out/got more cc‚Äôs than I started with. But I think it might have been the cleanser itself? Not sure. 
I‚Äôve read that sulfur soap helps with the fungal part of acne, so I‚Äôm trying to figure out which to get first: just straight tto to dilute with my moisturizer, or the sulfur soap? ü§î Thank you! I think I needed to hear (read) another person tell me how they used all those before I really started to bite the bullet and buy oils to try out.  U rite, I do feel a little more evil after yelling at 5AM I really liked it, but yep. My skin felt tight and I could see my skin start getting sort of scaly right after. I might try that La Roche one. I've used the CeraVe hydrating one, but then I feel my skin isn't clean enough after. When I swipe my face with my alcohol free cucumber Thayer's, there's still a bit of gunk that comes off on the cotton round. And, this is with me using the Dermalogica Pre-Cleanse oil before using the wash. Lately, I've been using the It Cosmetics Confidence In A Wash (? I can't remember the exact name off the top of my head), so far it's doing pretty well.

Depending on the day, I can be oily or combination. So annoying. -_- Thanks so much for the tip! It's always great hearing from people experiencing improvement who have similar skin struggles as you!
 I‚Äôm not sure what it does, every shelfie is see has witch hazel so I must be missing out... Thank you, I had been there before but it seems like they are always sold out. So finally they aren't and I spent too much money! :)  Hmm okay! Thanks for the suggestion.  I still use it but just as a spot treatment (trying to fade PIE and I‚Äôve heard it helps). It doesn‚Äôt bother me, only bothers when I apply it to my whole face. Is this true? I‚Äôve been using klair‚Äôs toner under vitamin C,  i am very new and don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing.  You can use it with water based products. On the TO website they recommend that you uses it after and water based solutions though. I've heard people recommend the Vitamin C as a final step in the routine but I guess it's just about what works for you.
And TO also say that it can be mixed with other solutions including Buffet to help reduce tingling.  When I asked for routine help from TO they told me to use it last, and it was after several water-based products. Maybe check with TO? I add it neat to the areas I really want help with, and then add it to my Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin and apply all over.  Otherwise I feel like I'd finish a bottle really quickly too.  I use vit C at night so I don‚Äôt look greasy all day at work. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be buying niacinimide + zinc again. I‚Äôm really undecided and can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs making a difference. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs common around here but I like to rotate products, mainly because I don‚Äôt like applying a bunch of products at one time. The main issue with TO products is their texture. More expensive products have better textures that can be layered, ... I wish they made more "all-in-one"-type of products so I wouldn't have to use so many different products A great (cheap) place to start is using micellar water! I started using it about a month ago and it's dramatically improved my cleansing step. I bought a bottle of Garnier micellar water for about $8 and I use it to remove my makeup, especially my eye makeup. Then when I cleanse with CeraVe (same as yours) it's just cleaning off the oil cleanser and grime. My skin is soooo much less stripped. No problem! It is absolutely one of the most common misconceptions I see on here so trust me you're not the only one! r/asianbeauty has a great write up on their sidebar about the difference, and different products you can sub in for oil cleansers of they're not your thing. 

Congrats on your skin improving! Thank you for sharing your routine- def getting some tips from you and helped me decide what TO products i should try next.  
  
It sounds like we have very similar skin but I have rosacea acne. My skin is so happy when I oil cleanse and it truly gets rid of eye makeup better than anything else. Since I don‚Äôt have to scrub my eyes and I‚Äôm not using as much drying soap, the skin around my eyes is a lot happier too.  If it takes everything off... why would you use it twice?

The point of double cleansing is what I outlined above. Using the same cleanser twice does absolutely nothing positive. Sure you CAN do it, but there is no reason to. No it's "No BS vit C", I thought i received a bad batch, so I did some research on this sub and apparently that's what some vit C serums smell like. But it's awful, I'm gonna look into this one when I'm done.  The Bioderma one works great and is super gentle. It is a bit pricier, but it goes on sale and sometimes they have 2 for 1 packs. Oh no, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that! Do you remember which micellar water it was? They make a couple of different types. I use the pink cap, the one for sensitive skin. Another cheap micellar water rec that is popular is the Simple Micellar Cleansing water. And finally if your skin is ultra sensitive perhaps look into La Roche Posay‚Äôs Micellar Water Ultra. It‚Äôs pricier but claims its gentler and 100% hypoallergenic. Hope that was helpful!  Maybe YesTo? They make a few different types! I think the cucumber is advertised as soothing. I use and am in love with the coconut one.  Samesies. I used it for a month or so and was fine but then suddenly my skin would get so red and flushed and just feel like it was burning. I quit using it for two months then tried to reintroduce it this week but nope. My skin hates me right now. Use something like the Heimish all clean balm instead! That‚Äôs what I use for double cleansing. I‚Äôm by no means an expert but when I started looking into oil cleansing I heard that argan, jojoba, and coconut are good! However these oils can be comedogenic depending on your skin so definitely patch test. My skin is pretty hardy so to test the oil cleanse waters I jumped in with Burt‚Äôs Bees Cleansing Oil which is a mix of coconut and argan. Other decent drugstore oil cleansers I considered trying out were Simple Hydrating Oil Cleanser (grapeseed oil based) and Palmer‚Äôs Skin therapy cleansing oil (grapeseed, jojoba, and rosehip oil based). Asian Beauty brands also have a lot of great oil cleansers too if that‚Äôs something you are interested in checking out! Of course other people can DIY their own oil cleanse from coconut oil, olive oil, argan oil, etc but I wanted to make sure I bought an emulsifying oil cleanser to make sure that I was able to rinse it off by itself! What that means is that you put the oil on a dry face and work it in, then you can rinse it off with water because the water will combine and emulsify with the oil, leaving your face clean and non-oily! Using plain oil would mean you have to wash your face after to get the oil off. I double cleanse in the PM to make sure I got all my makeup/gunk from the day off, but in the AM I just oil cleanse! I hope that was helpful, I‚Äôm always willing to spread the love of oil cleansing üòÇ I have it to, but OP here says they use it right after cleansing with the cerave foaming cleanser, but I use it right at the end of my routine before I put on my cleanser. Do you use it in the beginning or end? I use this cleanser too. Mine is a clear liquid with a soap like consistency, you have to rub it between your hands to make it foam. I also have the lotion, which comes in the exact same packaging but with blue lettering instead of green. So I could see getting them mixed up. If it helps, the foaming cleanser is clear, the hydrating cleanser is milky, and the lotion is white. The hydrating cleanser doesn't foam, I wonder if that's what you have?  I was just as confused initially. 
No, it does not pump out foamy. It is supposed to be that sort of silky cleanser feel. What makes it ‚Äúfoamy‚Äù is rubbing it on your skin! I rub it in circles all over for about 1 minute straight, and then it kinda suds.  Sounds more like their hydrating cleanser.  I‚Äôm thinking about trying out a hydrating toner, since I need all the moisture I can get lol. But I do like the feeling of using a toner.  [deleted] [deleted] Do you think it might work for me? I've had it since I was a child. 
Also, how often do you use it with the vitamin serum?  Oh duh, i knew that lol. Thank you!  I use Niacinamide in the mornings too. What's Buffet? And thanks! I think I have one with Vit C in it but I can't remember the bottles yet off the top of my head lol Thanks, I'm trying! I figure that I've had this redness for all of my life so what's another couple of weeks/months/however long it takes. It's been about a week but I'm not gonna give up until I use up the dropper! 3-4 days is amazing, I'm glad you had such great results! Thank you :) thanks for the info, ill have to look into both! Maybe I‚Äôll give that a try! Beautylish charges you the amount of tax charged in your province.  You shouldn't be charged anything more at the door, which is nice since there are no surprises. Sold. I've actually started the foaming cleanser for mornings and continuing to use the moisturizing one at night. I'm hoping that will help as I transition to summer and my skin changing with humidity Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop. I use it on my face every night!  I use it on both my face and body üòä  I have been using it on my face for months now, with no bad effects, but it does feel a bit heavy so I'm going to try the lotion next. It never has for me. The formula is very liquidy/light and disappears after a few minutes HG = holy grail. Used to refer to products that people on this sub absolutely love and can't go without  holy grail  Thanks! I had the same issue with the Corsx cleanser! I switched to Trader Joe's tto and it's been amazing! I put a small drop in my moisturizer and slather it all over.  I also want to know what it actually does. I went through a whole bottle and didn't notice that much of a difference. I bought some and it doesn't seem to do much. Witch hazel is an anti inflammatory so I guess theoretically it should help with that, but never noticed much difference.  Oh man. I‚Äôm waiting for my first set of TO stuff to come in the mail, including the niacinimide stuff. I reeeeally hope I‚Äôm in the group of people for whom it works well and doesn‚Äôt irritate or cause to have more breakouts! I want it to be a miracle for me sooo bad, lol.  I've been at this for months and I'm still confused. :D  Having said that, it is my understanding that actives (Vit C, BHA, AHA) go first after cleansing.  It has to do with PH levels and optimizing the actives.   

I believe you are meant to apply hydrating or similar toners (any toners that aren't AHA style, like glycolic toners from The Ordinary or Pixi Glow Tonic) AFTER the actives.  

You may wish to do a little digging on this forum, though, because I really still get confused sometimes myself. well, that was the advice i got when i asked here. here's where i asked: https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/85q8oq/new_or_need_help_ask_here_sca_daily_help_thread/dvzwef1/

the thing is that user didn't know my vitamin c was oil based, so i won't be able to use peptides after. but I assume that Vitamin C still needs to be the step directly after cleansing. I mean idk, please don't take my advice cause i'm confused and just going off of what I can piece together from around here lol i always try to incorporate something water based before or after using TO's 23% Vitamin C.

correct me if i'm wrong but I thought I read that L Absorbic Acid works better when its in a water based solution. The reason they don't package it in water based solutions is so that it doesn't oxidize quickly. Vitamin C is unstable and water based solutions of it have a very short shelf life. So I always add it over a slightly damp face, or mist with some water based toner afterwards. I use the TO Vit C suspension (dime size) with a few drops of their Reservatrol + ferulic after their alpha arbutin and buffet and it has been working beautifully That sounds terrible lol! I cant help but laugh though, Im sorry. I do recommend this one! Its gritty and to me (some people dont have this reaction) but it stings like a mfff lol. Especially if you put way more than a pea sized amount your first time, like i did. It got stuck in my eyebrows, and I wanted to cry hahah. But since then I only use literally a PEA SIZE amount (lmao) and it stings but its tolerable and so worth it. I can only use Bioderma full face, the other's caused break outs/irritation.  thank you!! I have very sensitive skin and I use the one with a pink cap with zero issues! I think the Garnier Micellar water (blue cap) was doing the same thing to my skin, but I had added a few products and I wasn't sure if it was the cause so I switched to the Simple micellar water and am only using that with Cerave Moisturizing Cream at night. Then I will add my products back in slowly. My skin feels a bit better so far so hopefully this is a good plan. Yes! So very helpful! Thank you so much.
I think I might just have to go down to my local target and check out some oil cleansersüòÇ! 
I think I might look into the Palmers, since its rosehip oil based and Im in love with rosehip products! Thanks again! I use it immediately after my cleanser, before my serums and oils. I use CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, rather than the foaming.  Maybe I got a fluke from the manufacturer then! Oh well. Is the moisturizer good? I haven't used it as an actual moisturizer yet, just once or twice as a "cleanser" before I noticed something was off.  Sounds like you def have the hydrating cleanser! It looks and feels a lot like lotion but is actually a cleanser. I've used both the foaming and the hydrating cleanser from CeraVe and I find the hydrating one to be much gentler and less drying on my skin.  It definitely looks milky, not thick like the lotion! Maybe that's what I have. But it feels like a "layer", definitely thick-feeling on my skin. I've had to use another cleanser to get it off. Does that sound right? Maybe I just don't need that much hydration. üòÇ Lol! Are you me? I was just looking for a hydrating toner in the questions sub like a week ago lol. I decided to just order the hyaluronuc acid from the ordinary, since my toner is basically brand new.. Lol let me know what works for you! Once this toner runs out I dont think Im going to repurchase. There isn't. 10% isn't actually usually recommended to use on its own. The recommended range is 2-4%. I wasnt too sure at first, but I actually got the idea from someone on here awhile ago. I went in slow with only a drop or two, then moving it up to 3-4 once I noticed it was helping. 
And as for my ratios I would say I use a whole Tablespoon of moisturizer for that 3-4 drops. 
(It actually does kinda seem like alot when I put that way lol. It might be a lot for most people. I would say go slow!) It depends! I use the cerave wash so I knew niacinamide didnt break me out, its also in my setting spray. So I was willing to give it a try. Do you use any products with it in there? That way you know it doesnt brake you out? Otherwise id try patch testing cause apparently it can brake some people out fairly bad. 
Ive had hyperpigmentation issues since I was a child as well. And have definitely seen improvements! it's good! THAT‚ÄôS what I was hoping for! Damnit now I need to go spend more money at Trader Joe‚Äôs lol. Thanks! I think they conned the world into buying spicy water Thayers in particular is a toner, I‚Äôm pretty sure. It made a huge difference in my skin, I like it a lot! Just make sure you patch test, and only introduce one new product at a time so you'll know which is causing the reaction if you have one.  I've patch tested several products (in different places) at once, but be careful to only add one full face at a time.  
This helped me to know more about what bothered my skin, and from there work out what ings made my skin worse.  Good luck! It seems like more people love it than have problems with it. What else did you order? But doesn't that just wipe the actives away? How does TO Vitamin C wear under foundation? I ordered mine and it's supposed to arrive in two days (yay!) so it's my first taste of TO products.  You‚Äôre welcome! Best of luck and hope it works out for you and your skin üòä I've been using it for a couple weeks and I like it, it has a nice light texture and seems to be pretty moisturizing.  It sounds like you have the CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser rather than the CeraVe foaming facial cleanser. The packages are identical except for the phrasing and a slightly more lime green color on the hydrating facial cleanser. The foaming one will foam up just like normal soap if you rub it rigorously between your hands. The hydrating one is milky and won't foam.

I also have dehydrated skin and actually recently switched from the foaming cleanser to the hydrating cleanser. The texture was really weird at first, but now I'm obsessed with it and love how hydrated my skin is. I find that I feel much more clean if I soak a cotton pad in micellar water and swipe it over my face to remove sunscreen/makeup first, though.  I'm going to jump on this same skin type train. I feel like I have and love almost all the same products as you! (Except for the Niacinamide which I'm going to go buy now). The HA from The Ordinary was ok, but didn't knock my socks off. What I'd recommend instead is the Buffet! So hydrating. Like liquid silk on your face. Ooh I got a decant of Klairs Supple Preparation Toner and loved it so much I got the full size version! People say it‚Äôs ‚Äúmeh‚Äù because it‚Äôs so simple but that‚Äôs exactly why I love it. I have dehydrated skin as well. (Edited to add that I like the Klairs way more than the Hylamide Hydra Density Mist)

Also‚Äî curious, when did you buy your TO lactic acid with HA? My bottle is clear, not tinted :/ I keep it away from a window anyways at least... Weird, we‚Äôre going to have a very similar routine!

I use the cerave foaming cleanser, plus The Buffet and the Niacinamide/Zinc. I just got the hyaluronic acid too because I‚Äôm trying to get all the moisture in that I can. It‚Äôs very sticky, I use it at night. I haven‚Äôt been consistent with it, so can‚Äôt really comment on it yet though.  [deleted] Honestly the tto at TJ was super cheap, less than $10! Be careful though, applying it directly can burn lol.... learned that the hard way.   I'm glad it worked for you! Guess it just doesn't do much for me :/ That‚Äôs good advice- thank you. Where do you usually patch test?  Let me think...

Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA
Niacinimide 10% + Zinc 1%
Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10%
Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%

The rest of my routine, that I‚Äôm already using, is:
PM -CeraVe foaming cleanser, then tretinoin 0.025%, then CeraVe in the tub 
AM -rinse/wipe face with wet soft cloth, Stridex red box, CeraVe in the tub, sunscreen if leaving house (I work from home and live in western Washington, and get very little light in through the windows) 
Also occasional use of benzoyl peroxide for pimples and hydrocortisone for irritation

What do you think?  Truthfully, I wonder the same thing sometimes. But really, you're supposed to give your actives a little time to sink in, even if it's just a minute or two, so that you aren't wiping it  all away. I havent had any issues with it. I read on the reviews on beautylish it caused some people pilling? But ive never had that issue. I use my cerave in the tub and sunscreen after tho, so maybe that has something to do with it? Spreads it more evenly maybe? 

Edit: This was my first TO purchase too! I can remember the excitement! Congratulations lol,  it was super exciting for me as well when I ordered it haha Ohhh. Ive been wanting to try the Buffet! My addiction is so real, with little to no effort, im sold! Hahah I bought it two months ago maybe ,a month and a half ago? So its still pretty new. And my bottle is clear, the serum is just a slight pinkish. I put all my serums in a dark cabinet anyways tho, just in case lol. I just got it today in the mail! Cant wait to toss that baby in lol.  AFAIK, niacinamide's efficacy maxes out at 4-5% and you're mostly just inviting possible irritation with the 10%. There might be something to the zinc claim, but I do know that n-acetyl glucosamine (which can be found in Holy Snails Shark Sauce and Stratia Rewind) has been proven to aid in niacinamide's efficacy, working synergistically.

I don't think the 10% would hurt, but it might be more irritating and/or worth mixing in with something else. Zinc in general can be very soothing to the skin and help the healing process with acne (or it breaks some people out and can be a bit drying...). Ymmv tbh. Well.. the advice I read was to do it where you'd normally break out.  But that would be on my chin, near my mouth, just very obvious places.  Also an area that is already damaged and scarred, so I didn't want to add to it.  

I actually did it mainly further back along my jaw line, even slightly under the jaw and also on my forehead.  My forehead rarely reacts (unless something is really going to cause a problem) so I'd also use there.  

Also.. keep the rest of your routine the same. So cleansing etc as you normally would. 

So it depends where you break out and how the skin is there? I also ordered Azelaic Acid Suspension. It came in yesterday so I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but I‚Äôll probably use it in my PM routine. I don‚Äôt know a lot about the other products you ordered, I‚Äôm still a skincare noob :) Just make sure to add one product at a time. Idk, most of what I've heard is thinnest to thickest. After cleansing I typically use the Klairs toner (Tarte tingle treatment 2x a week), pat in my essence, apply my vitamin c serum or Lytera serum, give it a few minutes to sink in, then top it with Belif cream mixed with a little squalane oil to seal it all in. I stopped using retinols recently since my husband and I are TTC but that was a serum also, that I'd alternate with the vitamin c serum. 

I've read retinols and vitamin c don't play well together. 

It seems to work, I'm happy with my skin, but of course I'd like to get a definitive idea of how to combine everything optimally.  Ah that‚Äôs good to know! Yeah this is going to be my first time trying out TO, also picked up some DE travel size items (which I‚Äôm hoping I won‚Äôt love because it‚Äôs expensive but also I will sell my soul for clear skin at this point). Let us know when you try your AHA BHA peel! It looks so scary haha  ohhh lol I was looking at your pic with my phone and it looked like one of the amber bottles, oops!! XD Ahhh, ok- that makes sense. 
Thanks so much for a great answer!  Thinnest to thickest, but within each product group, starting with actives. Next comes essences and serums, followed by creams and oils. Your actives depend on your ph and if you're putting other things on first, you're hindering their absorption.  Also, it depends on the. Vit C.  My curology script has Vit C and tret in it. Ok, but it was my understanding that patting in essence before the other stuff boosts the effects of serums and actives? So BHA/AHA before toner? I always use hydrating toner right after cleansing, before my exfoliating step and my retinol...  Me too.  Then I read stuff that seemed to contradict it.  Hence, confusion, lol. From what I have read, yes.  I agree it seems totally counter-intuitive.  And honestly, it could be wrong.  I feel like I've seen conflicting statements on the issue.  

I saved a post about it not too long ago, but, of course, I can't find it now.  However, [here] (http://www.snowwhiteandtheasianpear.com/2015/01/skincare-discovery-putting-your.html) is a great link I had found when trying to figure these issues out myself.  Hope that helps! Thanks!  Nice try drunk elephant I always wondered if people actually won. That‚Äôs awesome! I have dry skin and I have not been a sunscreen wearer my whole life. I've actually tried to get a tan on my face in my teensüò© (I certainly don't anymore)
The Littles include (and my reviews so far)
Marula Oil- melts into my skin and moisturizes in a way that lotions and serums just don't 
B Hydra- feels slick and unnecessary in routine but it's great right after a workout when my face is all red. 
Shaba Eye- really light and again, feels unnecessary but I've been using it on my lips and my lips are really soft these days.
La Retro- omg wow. This stuff is pure heaven. Plumps my skin and makes me look 5 years younger.
Sunscreen- weird texture, not my favorite. Definitely works though.
C Firma- I'm still not sure but I like it so far. Wears well under makeup. 
TLC Framboos- it's so expensive but it's so darn good. This will be the one product that makes the real difference I think. 
Beste Cleanser- perfect cleanser, my new fav Heyo! Since this isn't exactly a traditional haul post, I'm not gonna hold it to the usual haul requirements (why you bought them, where you're gonna use them, etc.) 

Buuuuut I'd love to know if you're excited about any products for a specific reason, or hell maybe even a few first impressions? Particularly LaLa Retro because I'm on the hunt for a new moisturizer :)
 ufff an unfortunate naming strategy for the D/L community  Bought into the hype and didn't particularly like any of the products to rebuy.  I won this contest, too!  I hate the ones to "tag a friend" that would mean you'd have to have friends. Okay, I do but they aren't on Instagram or they aren't into skincare.  How lucky! I really enjoy all of their moisturizers/hydrators and marula oil. Hope you enjoy too! Congratulations! I have to say, I'm kind of glad this brand's products don't work well for my skin, though - they're pretty pricey. 9It's great other people have had success with them and all, I just don't like them for me, even if the packaging is pretty.) I won a free blow out once from DryBar for guessing a location on Instagram. I've never win anything else though. That's awesome, Drunk Elephant is so good! *high five* me too! Loved the box it came in and my friend thought we'd been pranked üôÇ Wow nice haha I never win those damn things So lucky!!! I entered that too! Omg jealous  My friend and I also won this giveaway, I couldn‚Äôt believe it! Trying out Lala has totally convinced me to buy the full size when my mini runs out, that‚Äôs by far my favorite (besides the c-firma which I already have the full size of) but I have to say the eye cream is rather bland, haven‚Äôt noticed it do anything for my under eye dryness.  Well, how do you like it?!?!? Awesome! Congrats! Very cool! Hope you enjoy your goodies :) Nice. I feel slightly foolish in purchasing my The Little Kits.  But honestly it was worth it because I love testing the product range before purchasing the full bottle.  Nice! No wayyyyy! Soooooo jelly!! Enjoy xo Wow congrats! I always enter those Instagram contests, but never win. Now whenever I see one with more than 1k+ comments, I think, ‚Äúno chance‚Äù and I keep scrolling. But I guess I should keep trying!  Love their free samples Wow! I'm going to buy that set this weekend. How cool! :) I wish. I'm a sober mouse. I know, me too. Tiffany even sent a little note. It was because they got 300k followers.  I once won a giant dry bag because they asked what do you try to keep dry? And I replied wet underwear is the worst.  I actually won a free hat from Arizona Tea. It was such a surprise and i didn‚Äôt believe it was real until it showed up! I have never won anything in life...and then I randomly won 3 different Instagram contests in the past couple years. So crazy. (Zoya nailpolish, a book for me + friend plus signing, Tata Harper deluxe sample set).  Giveaways from legit companies are real! I won an expensive piece of All-Clad cookware on Williams-Sonoma's FB and a Big Green Egg Grill worth $1000 on Tabasco's FB. I've won a lot more than that, actually. Once I won $1000 each from two separate companies in a single month. You just have to keep entering these things;  someone has to win. Why not you? My company does Twitter giveaways (not skincare, sorry) and I‚Äôm sometimes in charge of picking the winners. Every time, 75% of the participants are these accounts that do nothing but enter contests 24/7. We never pick those because it‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre not likely to become loyal customers or engaged followers. So - if you have a normal Twitter/Insta account that posts actual content most of the time, I‚Äôd definitely encourage you to enter the occasional contest. At least in my experience, there are so few ‚Äúreal‚Äù people participating that you‚Äôll have a pretty good shot. They are the easiest comps to enter and I've won a few of them for different things I won three free months to a book club, and my friend won a candle. It‚Äôs worth it for the easy contests that are just like ‚Äútag a friend and you both win‚Äù. The contests that require you to follow a bunch of accounts are whack  I agree with you on the sunscreen! I got this set yesterday, and I tried the sunscreen today. I was surprised at how...mucus-y it was? Like when I squeezed it out and moved the bottle away, the sunscreen just kept dragging...like snot. I had a good farce-driven laugh about it though! Not OP but I got a decent-sized sample (5ml) of LaLa Retro a few months ago that I just finished. I liked it, but wouldn‚Äôt repurchase at that price point. I‚Äôve gotten better results from Aqua Bomb and Laneige‚Äôs sleeping mask, though my daily moisturizer is CeraVe.  I bought the Littles four months ago and just ran out of product. Lala Retro is the most luxurious moisturizer I've ever owned. If money was no option I would definitely buy it again. However, it wasn't so revolutionary that I can justify the price. I just did a mini review of the products so far and my impressions of them. But the LaLa Retro is a game changer. It plumps instantly. I have dry skin and it's transforming. I really love the Marula oil too. I really liked the texture of the retro whip, but it doesn't seem to moisturize for very long. I had to layer something over it. I wouldn't purchase the full size, although I thought it made a fabulously expensive hand cream as an alternate. My HG moisturizer is Neutrogena hydro boost extra dry. Best stuff for my dry, sensitive skin I've ever used (and I've used EVERYTHING.) Can confirm the retro whip is incredible. Saved my dry flaky skin. I‚Äôve tried every lotion and nothing compares. Also cleaned up complexion OR a great strategy. I considered getting them for my littles  I thought I was the only one. Agreed. Although, I did particularly dislike C-firma since that one almost burnt my face off. The rest were just "meh" for me and my skin. Just get them to give you their set ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I love everything DE but I'm not sure if it's the adorable packaging or the aesthetic Instagram. This month I'm only using their products to see if it really changes my skin. But so far, it's working and I love it! Thanks!! Love love. They hooked me with the BabyFacial and I've been a fan ever since. I took a before picture and this month I'm only using DE products so I can see if it really makes a difference.  Thanks! Hahaha I always think I‚Äôm not lucky too. But sometimes when I just try put a comment & didn‚Äôt expect anything üòÇüòÇüòÇ but ya. Lately I got a bottle of Kanebo first serum (almost $50). Ok. Slightly buzzed.  Mmm, Sober Mouse, my favorite 90s Washington indie band. I mean, that‚Äôs a damn good answer. But wtf is a dry bag? i love how you were still so excited to win a hat you were like "nah, fake" That's crazyyy I thought winning instagram competitions was a myth.  I'm in the same boat. I wanted to like them, and they were nice, but not revolutionary enough for me.  BabyFacial is soooooo good Hmm username does not check out r/bandnamesyoufellfor


 It‚Äôs a waterproof bag for camping. It‚Äôs has waterproof material and then the top usually rolls down and then buckles to keep water out.  I won a gift box from Bath & Body Works a few years back, I posted my haul from the semi-annual sale and tagged them and they direcet messaged me! Figured they would be sending a hand sanitizer and a coupon...

Nope, got a ridiculously heavy box for its size that had 3 full size products and a note! I thought so too lol Ohh, gotcha! I pretty much only ever go camping in the desert, so TIL!  Holy shit that's so nice. Most companies doing giveaways tend to be American or US based :'-( Agreed, I *assume* it's because international shipping can be a killer. Flat rate boxes go anywhere in the US! I always tell my partner that taking care of his body isn‚Äôt an effeminante action. It‚Äôs self care and everyone should be taking care of themselves. You should always be kind to yourself!  I love that lip balm. I discovered amazon sells different "flavors" and now I want all of them lol. Take care of yourself while you‚Äôre young, it catches up with you quick if you don‚Äôt! There's more dudes in here than you'd think. Since this blew up, I know a lot of guys want to know where to start as all of these products would be intimidating. Scroll to the bottom of this for most basic to more simple routines and which products to first start using.

1. I have pretty average skin and just want to prevent wrinkles now that I'm in my mid 20's
2. Routine and Purpose

* AM: Brickel Clarifying Gel Face Wash in a hot shower. Brickel Renewing Face Scrub also in the shower on Sundays. After drying my face, Thayer's Witch Hazel Cleanser with Rose Petal. Tree of Life Retinol Serum, then M3 Vit. C serum are applied and spread all over. Then Baebody Eye Gel is rubbed around my eyes. I let this all dry while brushing my teeth. Then a layer of Paula's Choice Hydrating Treatment Cream. And lastly Neutrogena Oil Free Sun Screen Moisturizer SPF 35. Then Jack Black intense therapy lip balm spf 25.
* PM: Brickel Clarifying Gel Face Wash at the sink. Thayer's Witch Hazel Cleanser. Retinol, Vit C serums, and Eye Balm. Lastly a layer of Neutrogena Triple Age Repair Night Moisturizer. And also the Jack Black Lip Balm again.
* The face wash cleans my skin. The scrub removes dead skin cells. The toner returns your face's pH back to baseline. The retinol increases cell turnover. The vit C helps hydroxylate collagen molecules. The moisturizers prevent the serums from drying out my skin. The eye balm helps prevent dark rings and bags under my eyes. The sun screen and lip balm prevent UVA/UVB damage from the sun.

Short Reviews: Brickel Clarifying face wash smells really nice and with a more manly fragrance. The Brickel Renewing Face scrub is soothing, but I'm careful to not rub aggressively. The Thayer's Witch Hazel is my favorite because that rose smell is intoxicating as hell. The Retinol Serum is easy to spread thinly. I really like the wide mouthed dropper of the Vit C serum. The Baebody Eye Gel noticeably hydrates the thin skin areas around my eyes and removed some darkness that bothered me. Paula's Choice Hydrating Treatment Cream is the most expensive item but doesn't leave a greasy feeling at all. The Neutrogena SPF is great because you can just barely tap the pump portion to get little micro dabs to spread on your face so that you aren't shiny with it. The Jack Black spf 25 lip balm doesn't leave a residue and seems to last until I put more on at night and the mint isn't obnoxious. The Neutrogena night moisturizer is a velvety soft cream that is easy to rub. Most everything lacks a fragrance unless I mentioned it which I really like so that my face doesn't smell different from my cologne.

Newbie Corner: 

Bare Minimum Routine: First and foremost get a nice face wash and an SPF moisturizer. Every AM wash your face with warm water which opens up your pores and then use your face wash. Then put on a thin layer of SPF moisturizer like half to full pea sized so your face isn't greasy. At PM wash your face again. 

Minimum of Anti Aging: You need to add VitC and Retinol serums. The science of why is above. You would then do the above routine but put some drops of these serums on your face and rub them all over and let dry before adding the SPF moisturizer. Always have a moisturizer after these serums or your face will dry out. 

From there: you can add an exfoliating scrub to use once or twice a week after washing. Or an eye balm to rub around your eyes. Or a night moisturizer so you can do the serums twice a day. Or the toner to better clean your face and balance pH. Or a lip balm if your lips are chapped. I don't like masks, they're time consuming and have made me break out. 

Cost Note: all of the products on that shelf total to probably about $150. That's ridiculous. But I've also been using them daily for a couple months and haven't made a dent in them because it's such small amounts.  37M and putting stuff on my face has taken off 5 years in 3 weeks. Shaving off my beard takes off at least 5 too so I'm a little scared to see the combination. Actually, I think it‚Äôs time we take a second look at femininity. What‚Äôs wrong with it? I too fall into the habit of mocking a guy for being to into his skin care and stuff but why? Females are bad asses and a lot of time, money, and effort goes into skincare. Not to mention science.  I know so many guys who want nice skin but then don't wash their face and sleep on the same pillowcase for months on end. It's great that you have such an organized routine OP! Except we all have skin. And it‚Äôs important. And you‚Äôre important. And your skin is important. Good on you  I got my husband a shower puff in the beginning of our relationship, about a decade ago, and now he has fancier facewashes than I do. He also started using my foot spa and electric foot file. Also my hairbrush, not cool. To think something is "feminine" and therefore not doing it is ....kind of weird. but yeah, skincare is great...all genders have skin The Jack Black lip balms are my absolute favorite, currently using the grapefruit & ginger one.  It's honestly is a big passion of mine even though I am also a guy and I don't think self care is feminine at all and people who thinks that are pretty dumb. How do you like the Brickell face wash/scrub?

I have mixed feelings on Brickell products. I really liked the charcoal face cleanser and the eye cream (even though it‚Äôs pretty expensive). The hair conditioner was pretty terrible though, left my hair really greasy, and you have to use a lot of it because it sort of disappears when you put it on your scalp.

They are  known to have a lot of  fake positive reviews I‚Äôve discovered recently, their Fakespot grade on a lot of their products are pretty low. I do like the idea of what they‚Äôre trying to do w/more natural/organic ingredients though. I‚Äôm sort of on the fence if I should invest in any other of their products. Yes!!! Healthy skin is for everyone, regardless of gender. Someone who can take care of themselves is always a good sign of character.  May I ask, I‚Äôm also a M 21 years old and would like to know what the thayers witch hazel and vitamin c is for? I see many people have those on their routines, and leaves me wondering if I should have it too. Nothing wrong with feminine.  It‚Äôs too late I‚Äôm down the skincare rabbit hole as well. Tbh, I love the routine. TREAT YO SELF Nice job. If I could make a suggestion, I‚Äôd swap out that retinol serum you‚Äôre using with one The Ordinary‚Äôs. Same price point and a much better product. Tree of Life serums tend to use lower strength and quality ingredients.  How u liking the eye gel? Just picked some up yesterday. Your shelf is like the front page of Amazon's most popular skincare  Even if it is feminine, does that mean its bad? I agree. Also check out r/wicked_edge if you haven't already. There's so much to do.
I don't know how and where to start from? I agree. But have to be careful. I got acne like never before with anti aging routines, then while my super fine lines faded then I had to address reactions and cystic acne. If I were 20 and knew better I‚Äôd have slathered my face with nilotica shea butter every night to prevent myself overreaction to the first fine lines (cause yep, dryness makes lines seem more than they are! And my meds do that though overmoisturizing causes me issues too) So good idea, but don‚Äôt go too overboard at first. I can‚Äôt use a lot of this but is good for 20. I tell my almost 5 year old she needs to take care of her skin, so I moisturize her face with cleaner products like aveeno baby, cause she gets dry and flakey, almost eczema type patches, and say take care of your skin. She gets it, told her dry skin also causes pimples lol as she‚Äôd sit counting my pimples with etheylhexyl palmitate mishap! Hahaha. I even lotion her body, I figure it is routine that‚Äôs best drilled in young. 

I didn‚Äôt get stretch marks while pregnant and lotioned a lot since I was told dry skin doesn‚Äôt stretch well and truth. But puberty I got loads on my hips because I knew no better to lotion and hydrate. Thumbs up, I say 21 is best to start an anti aging routine anyways.  how is the vitamin c serum working? i‚Äôve been considering getting one but ive been skeptical. how do you like it? currently trying to teach my dad that self care and grooming is not a gendered activity!  Low key tried that eye cream. There‚Äôs better for the same price son!!! Whatever you do, don't get into Asian Beauty products. First you tell yourself ampoules look interesting...then you look at snail mucin and propolis. Before you know it, you've been sucked into the 10 step K-beauty routine and you find yourself...head tilted back, balancing a sheetmask on your face, as you try heading back to your room from the bathroom. 

My routine grew from a small simple routine of cleanse, shave, hydrate, and spf. Now I use a first cleanser, second cleanser with my Clarisonic, 2 different toners, an essence, vitamin c serum, 2 anti-aging serums, facial oil, 2 layers of moisturizer, retin-a micro, sleeping pack, heavy occlusive, sunscreen, and my weekly glycolic peel. I am more high maintenance than my sister.   Skincare is healthcare :) I just ordered some Brickwell sample kit! 
I‚Äôm super excited to try it! I love Thayers! I‚Äôm also using retin a. Using retin a and vit c is fine? There won‚Äôt be any damage to skin? I was just scrolling through my feed real quick and I thought the bottle in the back left was jack daniels lol Taking care of our skin should be a regular thing for everybody, it‚Äôs our biggest organ anyway. Good for you!

A quick note, you shouldn‚Äôt mix Retinol and Vitamin C on the same application. Maybe try Vita C in the AM and Retinol in the PM? That‚Äôs how I do it and it will simplify your routine as well.    Honestly skin care is nothing 'not-masculine' for a man. But i dont think talking about it is necessary. Just keep it to yourself and keep lookin good  I use Brickell as well. Their charcoal mask and anti aging cream are both great if you haven‚Äôt tried them just FYI.  that lip balm is the best!! i‚Äôve been repurchasing it for 3+ years now  [deleted] Thayers is a fave  What‚Äôs the Thayer‚Äôs Witch Hazel toner like? How‚Äôs the eye gel? Does it work? I have the neutrogena oil free moisturizer with spf as well as their 110 spf. I‚Äôve noticed though the neutrogena spf burns my top eyelids and they swell a bit. Does anyone else get that reaction?? Do you not get them OP? Other than that, love your Shelfie! 


Edit: Autocorrect on brand name  I agree 100%. I turn 40 this year and started my skin care routine in my early 20s.  Thank God I did cause I only have a couple small lines.  I have also been using prescription strength Retinol for a few years also.  Key is applying a sunscreen higher than 15 spf every day.  Even days it's pouring rain or your going to be inside all day.  UVA/UVB Ray's are our skins enemy!!! I just bought some of that toner yesterday. My skin is extremely dry and I'm trying some moisturizers and toners because makeup seems to seep into the cracks of my face and I hate it Is using eye gel/anti ageing stuff important even in your 20s? I just hit my 20s Does the eye gel work well for dark circles? My husband loves Brickell's products! That lip balm was the only thing that got me through accutane.  How‚Äôs that eye gel? I am a dude who has the DARKEST circles  I get plenty of sleep. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with me.Everyone always says I look tired.  Where‚Äôs the sunscreen!!!! The most important step is protection and prevention!! What are your thoughts on the Baebody Eye Gel? Where can I find a list of products and a daily routine for men?  YES BROTHER! how do you like the retinol serum from tree of life? i‚Äôm considering purchasing it Great skin care routine! Are there updates on your skin? I have a lot of dark spots due to acne. I hope you skin care works on my skin. Thanks! I like jack black and brickel a lot good stuff  My face usually feels clean after cleansing so I think I‚Äôll be fine without that. I‚Äôve heard vit c helps fade hyperpigmentation, do you know if that is true? If so I might just have to try it out. My SO is 29 and he could still pass for 20 easily. He uses sunscreen and shares my extensive skincare routine. Keep up the great work! Thanks for this! Hoping someone can answer.. Are eye creams legit? What‚Äôs the difference if you use face cream by your eyes?  Yasssss How do we get started?  Just got my Brickell products this week! Woot woot Just got my Brickell products this week! Woot woot Rose witch hazel (rose ANYTHING) is huffable. Wish I could fill a pool with it.  What is your ethnicity? I've seen starter packs but this one takes the take. Just curious how some of these products will affect my skin.  That eye gel fucks! It‚Äôs magically with puffyness. Yea! This makes me so happy! My boyfriend loves his skincare and it makes me so happy to help him find products that help his skin.  You and I literally have the same products! üëèüèº I am a guy and I don't care about my face starting to look old...It's distinguished and a right of passage.  But gawd damn it...it's hard to look old and distinguished with adult acne.  So watch me go as I clean, exfoliate, moisturize, etc.

I shave with a straight razor to balance out the un-manliness of exfoliating.

There's probably room in the market for skin care products other than beard stuff advertised towards men.

\*\*edit

lol at the downvotes Damn your skincare collection is better than mine and I‚Äôm a girl There's a difference between skin care and having 10+ products on the go... None of that stuff does anything besides moisturize your epidermis [deleted] I think men wear makeup now and even have makeup lines like the men‚Äôs skincare lines. Overall it helps their own confidence I do believe. Cause that‚Äôs why I do it. 

My 65+ dad has more products than my mom for skin and hair lol. But I think in Hispanic cultures it‚Äôd always been more acceptable for men to be up on hair and skin care anyways.  I keep threatening to jonathan van ness my boyfriend lol he said exfoliation is 'gross'  Yep, they sell it at Sephora and Ulta too. I've been wearing it for years. Every time I try a different one, I always come back to the JB. The ginger and grapefruit one is probably the best one besides the original mint one imo. Thank you for this tip. I got a sample through Birchbox and been addicted since. Didn't know they had different "flavors" I started using their supreme shave cream, absolutely amazing as well.  I love mine.  Skincare should be proactive, aging doesn't go in reverse!  > > little micro dabs

Jsyk there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre not applying enough sunscreen to get the label SPF this way.  Dermatologists recommend applying 1/4 tsp of sunscreen for the whole face. Considering that you use some retinol and Vit C, it might be a good idea to incorporate a separate non-greasy sunscreen from your moisturizer so you get the right amount. La Roche-Posay makes some great options that are super watery and absorb quickly, as do Asian brands like Biore, Skin Aqua, and Klairs. Most American brands will have that greasy feeling though.  Speaking as a man who‚Äôs just now starting to want to take better care of his skin, thank you for posting this. It‚Äôs super useful and kind of inspiring even. 

I imagine one would want to introduce a few of these at a time into one‚Äôs routine rather than trying to do them all at once. Is there any particular order or priority you‚Äôd recommend? Thanks for the post, especially your purpose statements!  That's super useful.

Also, cool username! Love Vit C for my skin. Most people dont realize it's an important coenzyme in hydroxylating collagen.  Another important cofactor in collagen synthesis is iron!  Make sure you're getting enough iron every day.

Adding to your comment on Vit A, it's also known to downregulate keratin expression in skin cells.  This becomes more of a problem for my older SCA friends as they are highly likely to develop scaly SK's and AK's.

TLDR: Vit A & C are great for your skin (in moderation of course). You use Vit C and Retinol serums twice a day? Did you have to build up to that, and if so, how long before you did twice a day? Have you tried Neutrogena Hydroboost ? Wonder how the night moisturizer compares don‚Äôt tell anyone to use ‚Äúlittle micro dabs‚Äù or a ‚Äúpea sized‚Äù amount of spf. it will not work if you don‚Äôt use enough. please don‚Äôt give advice based on bad information.  Aim for european sunscreens, in USA newer generation are still not approved but may be in near future. >The Brickel Renewing Face scrub

Is there a reason why you don't  rub the Brickel Renewing Face scrub aggressively? I have the same issue, though I'm 22 so I really don't want to look like a 17 year old. Stubble life Careful, you don't want to Benjamin Button yourself into a fetus...or worse!  Please recommend a shave cream that is skin safe, for not causing acne, as some of us women do use a men‚Äôs razor to shave off baby hair on the face all over. Helps make up look better but I‚Äôve found women‚Äôs shave cream breaks me out ugh. I‚Äôm sure men have better options but no idea. These blond hairs drive me bonkers!!! Drop that product list/routine good sir How do you suggest encouraging a man to start a skin care  routine? My husband looks about 5 years younger than he is but I can tell he is insecure about his age and looking older. It is a struggle to even get him to put on sun screen before a full day at the lake. I know he would love the results but I don‚Äôt want him to feel like I think he looks bad.  >feminine

Completely agree! This was the first thought when i read the title

While the OP can be given the benefit of doubt, i take mild offence to "feminine" used in the title. Why is self care "feminine". Luxurious, yes. I agree it's a luxury to have the time and money to spend on yourself. But it's so beneficial. Almost like an investment in yourself. Not shallow at all.   >sleep on the same pillowcase for months on end

I know too many guys who want nice skin but don‚Äôt even own a pillowcase, so at least they‚Äôve got that going for them? Someone said to me the other day they hoped tret worked for them so they wouldn‚Äôt have to do something so ridiculous like changing their pillowcase and face cloth every couple days. Saw it was a man. But was like wha, that‚Äôs the easy part. But I like fresh laundry anyways lol.  Involuntary thought... skinless people. No, no, bad brain! No skinless people in brains before bedtime! Eep. Slim Goodbody creepers. 

Fluffy puppies.
Fluffy puppies.
Fluffy puppies. Yea I don't get the whole "we I thought it was for girls, but now I know it's for boys too!" mentality. Like, cool, but everyone should practice some self care my dude. Are they good for intense moisture and healing? I have post-winter zombie lips :( I like the scents. I don't have a ton of experience to compare them to but my face definitely feels clean and not dry after using either product. And when I use the toner, it doesn't pull off any more dirt spots that I can see. I'm not too paranoid about how good of a cleanser it is because that's probably the hardest thing to screw up. I've thought about trying their charcoal mask as well. Do those fake reviews include amazon?  I have trouble with Fakespot because it flags cult favorite products, too. Like, the CosRX Low Ph Gel flags as potentially fake, but I know the love for it on /r/AsianBeauty is real.  It's in my comment description. But the witch hazel toner gets a bit of a further cleaning after the cleanser and also returns your face's pH back to normal after washing it. VitC is a cofactor needed in collagen production. Collagen prevents wrinkles Thayers is for too much oiliness. And for actives not to lose potency by being diluted by oil ( AHAs) i think. Thanks I will! I'm considering going to my general practitioner and asking for Tretinoin. I'm not sure if he'll prescribe something prophylactically but I've heard they will  YMMV, I bought that eye gel a couple of years ago based on the massive amount of good reviews on Amazon and it made the skin around my eyes burn so bad.  Super hydrating and also I feel like the skin is less dark as well Not OP, but I‚Äôve been using it and I love it. I didn‚Äôt think an eye gel would be hydrating but it is.  I didn't jump into this full routine right away. Start by just using a daily spf and washing your face in the AM and PM. If you want the basic "trifecta of anti aging" it's spf/vitC/retinol. But you're going to need to use a moisturizer with the VitC and Retinol serums so you don't dry your face out.  I got a couple pimples every time I tried a cucumber face peel mask so I'm not doing masks anymore ha I eventually would LOVE to get more products so my routine can resemble the Korean skincare routine more. I barely started double cleansing, but I still can't afford products like toners, essences, and masks. However, I do wonder, are the extra products really beneficial? Like, have you seen improvements that justify the spending? It‚Äôs too late for me now. üòÇ I am curious about the same thing.  " A recent study revealed two important facts: not only did retinol prove [**effective when paired with vitamin C**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/anti-aging-wrinkles/how-does-vitamin-c-help-skin.html), but the two worked beautifully together to defend skin against environmental assault when applied under a sunscreen.

The (misguided) concern about combining these ingredients is also based on misconceptions about pH and acidity. Vitamin C, especially ascorbic acid, requires a low pH to remain stable‚Äîor no pH, if there isn‚Äôt any water in the formula. The result is a more acidic environment, but we know acidity doesn‚Äôt deactivate retinol; after all, skin‚Äôs pH is naturally acidic and retinol naturally occurs in skin.

Better yet, research has shown that a combination of vitamins in cosmetics will provide optimal results‚Äîincluding vitamins A (another name for retinol), C, and E. [**Vitamin C actually helps retinol work better by stabilizing it, extending its effectiveness.**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-ceramide-enriched-firming-eye-cream/216.html) It turns out that using retinol without vitamin C or another potent antioxidant could keep your skin from reaping all of retinol‚Äôs benefits." You can use vitamin C after tret after you do the wait to moisturize if it‚Äôs a stabilized version. Same with niacinamide which is why some C serums have it. It‚Äôs straight ascorbic acid that‚Äôs a no no. But since it boosts up sunscreen yeah mornings make more sense. Trying to add in glycolic and azelaic acid into all this though. I use glycolic 30 min before tret, so I don‚Äôt see myself using C at night. 

I need to research if azelaic acid and C can get along hmm.  I like Brickell's scents. I haven't used any of their anti-wrinkle things. After a few months of that entire shelf's routine, I feel like the tiny micro wrinkles I noticed above my eyebrows weren't as visible when I furl my brow. I've heard good things about their charcoal mask making your skin feel tight though. I think that's the last product I'll add to the shelf. I haven't really made a dent in any of the other products, but I'm about half way through that cleanser after a month and a half It's my favorite product. It has a faint hint of rose and really makes my face feel clean before putting everything on. Ironically if I had to omit a product, I imagine that one does the least I think it lightened my circles. Def hydrates No, you can just use moisturizer, the skin around your eyes isn‚Äôt different than the rest of your face

Moisturizer and spf in general though, definitely! Not a zilch if dark circles are because tear trough. Tear trough? You lost fat and or volume around that bone under your eyes. If thats case surgery can help, while fillers risk side effects and are temporary. It's there in the back row of the pic ha I used to use it in the AM and PM and never noticed anything granted it's all preventative right? Anyways I then got on 0.05% Tretinoin from my GP and use that instead. When I use that I notice my face feeling almost very slightly sunburned, and if I use it twice a day, I'll start to get flaky skin. Sooo I don't think the Tree of Life product has a lot of active ingredient since it didn't exhibit what I'm noticing with the Tret. Someone else in this thread suggested the Ordinary's brand as having more active ingredient It does but you need to make sure you where sunscreen while using vitamin C as the sun will actually darken spots on you if you don‚Äôt.  Daily spf moisturizer and wash your face in AM and PM is first step. From there, the trifecta of anti aging is spf, Retinol, and vitC. So if you wanted to go that second route, in the AM you'd wash, rub a couple drops of both serums into your face, rub in a sunscreen lotion. All tiny amounts so you don't have grease face.  I'm white i feel like no matter how old you look everyone will still be able to tell you're a child  It's not avoiding looking old. It's trying to look like my 30's in my 40's etc. I'm not going to get paranoid when I start getting wrinkles or want botox, but I don't think any older guy if asked if he could look 5-10 years younger in the face would say no lol. Try using a morning facial wash with salicylic acid. It's got little beads for exfoliating and is cheap. I think it's called like "Morning Burst" at my grocery store Why do they need to be on the go? If I'm traveling I'd bring the spf, serums, and day moisturizer  I have good skin, but that's not going to slow down aging fyi. You need spf/retinol/vitC for that LOL I never noticed until you pointed it out. But when I was waiting tables, most of the kitchen staff were Hispanic. A lot of those guys had crazy fades, beards that were kept trimmed to an incredibly sharp line, and had used product in their hair even on days when they'd be stuck in a hot kitchen where no one would appreciate how much effort they put into their hair.  Used to work with kids in Nicaragua, the boys show up to kindergarten with hair gel and cologne and they love it lol. Always said they just wanted to be like dad. Your right. I wonder why that is. I thought it was because we‚Äôre more into European fashion but my boyfriend is Austrian and doesn‚Äôt even use face wash just soap. Never puts lotion on and same with his friends. I live in Germany now and all lotions and stuff are marketed to women. When I lived in Mexico all the guys took care of their hair, wore cologne, wore lotion. Maybe it‚Äôs from being closer to the equator and getting more sunburnt? Getting sweaty and needing deodorant? Just more general hygiene issues? Yeah, I think in South Korea, its becoming more acceptable for guys to wear makeup or at least BB cream. I know my brother started wearing BB cream in high school because of some of his korean friends. Skincare is definitely big among men there too. They even have skincare designed for the military. I like to imagine their military like [this.](https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1-k-drama-beauty-sheet-mask-descendants-of-the-sun.gif) If i'm going out with a guy I don't expect him to have a full long skin/haircare routine but I expect him to at least care for his skin and hair. Men should put as much effort into looking decent as women do. If i'd expect it from a female partner, it's fair to expect it from a male one. Would kind of hair products does he use? Is it more for styling or promotion of healthy hair? So ur sayin men wearing make up and take care of their own skin is alright and not weird? I wish someone told me this, I have not taken care of my own skin until recently and part of it is already scarred and i regret it. I don know why men are not allowed to wear make up and some even question men who use skincare products which I don know why Introducing one of my best guy friends to moisturizer and BB cream was such a great day.  not my family. and im hispanic I can't tell by the writing on the bottle but love a good lip balm. What brand is it if you dont mind me asking? This is very good point! Most of my friends apply very small amounts of sunscreen (like a pea sized amount) and from what dermatologists have told me that is just not enough to get the protection factor listed on the bottle. I started slathering myself, in it. Paulas's Choice has really nice sunscreens that won't give you that greasy look. I have been using the Resist Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense (I know, the name is way to long) for years, and it helps keeps my face looking matte all day. Even with the makeup I apply on top of it. I updated my main comment to have a newbie corner for you!  Prestige reference? üòâ Depends on the retinol serum actually which retinoid and how much it has. It's the other forms like tretinoin that cause much more irritation so should absolutely not be applied that often.
 
I looked up the brand he uses and it has many other ingredients besides retinol, lots of botanicals. That may be why he gets no irritation. No I just always have and haven't had a problem with it Yeah I was thinking that alternating the vitamin c to the AM and the retinol to the PM would probably allow them to work better, both of those actives at once could  lessen their efficacy and/or be potentially irritating. You don't want to create micro tears in your skin. You're just trying to slough off some dead skin cells. Hence why only once or twice a week and gently. This community actually prefers using chemical exfoliants like lactic or glycolic acid instead of physical exfoliants like facial scrubs because of this reason. I plan to switch to a lactic acid eventually Start early, skins care is preventative  It will definitely work in your favor when you're older!  Have you tried anything from [Cremo?](https://cremocompany.com/mens-shave)

I had issues with breakouts and irritation with nearly everything I tried, I'm always smooth as glass after using the original for a while. my husband uses a beard oil but you can just put a facial oil on before shaving, helps the razor glide and to soften hairs. then afterward he just uses a face cream. As far as I understand women's shaving stuff is just men's stuff but more expensive. No reason to every get women's shave cream, just get some basic Gillette shaving stuff, then progress from there to more sensitive stuff if it's a problem. FYI (and this may be hipster-y shite and not scientific fact) shaving cream that you work to a leather rather than shaving foam is generally recommended. Check out https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/wiki/

There's not enough of a difference for you to use specifically women's stuff; there's simply more products marketed towards men so make use of them! You will want to avoid the products that are listed as being aggressive, as you're not a swarthy man. So - no Feather blades. If you're doing it occasionally, I enjoy the Brickell shave cream but I haven't really looked at the ingredients, and it's mad expensive if you use it daily. Their aftershave is nice too. I only know this because I got a free sampler. 

Many of the men's products come with lavender or similar scents.  Wait what?? Doesnt they return harder and stronger like beard? Will it on guy? Evening, one of: salicylic acid, vitamin C, zinc/niacinimide, magnesium oil, retinol, or azaleic acid kind of at random

morning: SPF moisturizer if I used retinol or salicylic the night before, or I plan to be outdoors; cerave otherwise Show him this

It made a big impression on me not just because it's visually arresting but because it shows how much difference our choices can make. Thinking of aging as inexorable makes it more appealing to try to ignore. Exactly. I applaud this dude for stepping outside constrictive gender norms, but why did he ever think being feminine was an insult? 


Not attacking OP but it seems to be that things like skincare or makeup are considered feminine and being feminine is inherently bad so their use is bad. I see that ingrained sexism.  I was too poor for a pillowcase and used t shirts totally works  I wear mine to bed and can still feel it in the morning! It‚Äôs been a lifesaver this winter!! They really are imo, I have lips that dry and crack easily and this lip balm has worked great for me. I‚Äôve used it for the past few years and love it. I also use an agave lip mask at night by Bite and I‚Äôm sure that helps too.  Stop kissing zombies, silly.  My daughter too, is a zombie kisser. (Allergies, asthma, & mouth breathing.) She's 13 now, so I don't do this any more, but I used to put a thick layer of lanolin on her lips after she was asleep. Helped a ton overnight, and it was easier for her to not shirtsleeve the goopy salve off, since she was zonked out anyways. 
You can almost always get free samples of lanolin, and it lasts forever. I made another comment before seeing this, but I vouch for their charcoal mask. It‚Äôs one of my favorite products they make.  Yeah, that's where most of the fake reviews are. I've only tried 3 products, so I don't want to write them off too soon. Like I said, I like what they're trying to do, but I'm staying away from their hair products: that conditioner was probably the worst one I've tried in a while, super thick, almost like pomade. If he doesn‚Äôt, differin is a really good drugstore retinoid! It was previously Rx only.  You‚Äôll have an easier time getting a prescrip if you go in with acne.  I purchased that same eye gel about a year ago and I don‚Äôt feel like it did much for me. Scary to hear that it burned your skin!  I will say that it did smell good though. I had issues with it, too. Not burning, but after about 2 months of daily use I noticed the muscles under my eyes would twitch throughout the day for short periods of time (maybe 3 or 4 minutes, then stop.) It was super irritating and nothing in my diet or personal life had changed (no added stress, sleeping the same, etc) so I chalked it up to the gel.

After a few weeks of not using it, the twitching stopped. Made me nervous about the harshness of the ingredients in an area so delicate. Sucks bc it was the only under eye cream I've used that actually helped my dark circles.  I'm already intimidated by what you said, I just wash my face with a gentle face wash twice a day. [deleted] That‚Äôs just Paula‚Äôs word! How do I know that what she said is backed up with scientific research? I love it when people come through with THE FACTS.  I needed to know this too.   Really interesting, right now I'm doing Vit C am and retinol pm, but after reading this I think I may switch to both pm. Does it matter which serum you apply first? Same is said about glycolic or lactic acid. 

Now see yoderm mixed tret and lactic acid. 

My skin changed overnight using a glycolic toner before tret omg enough for others to say something. 

Benzoyl peroxide was another, it didn‚Äôt impair retin a gel. No data on the cream however. I did this and worked great but don‚Äôt do it every night is all I can say lol. Spot treat perhaps the benzoyl peroxide after tret.  Does it dry quickly? I kind of hate to use toner that is too slow to dry in high humidity weather in my country. Ohhh. I keep seeing it everywhere and I‚Äôm tempted to try it.  I was reading reviews on Amazon and it has mixed reviews especially from POC.  okay thank you! No...I cannot wait to look like Clint Eastwood.

I already use Neutrogena Deep Clean beta hydroxy.

Also...get off my lawn. I love this.

EVERYTHING you as grooming, your face and skin, should be for YOU. It's a nice bonus if other's think you look good too. Who doesn't like validation?  But your self care should always be for you, and what makes YOU feel good. i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just cultural differences, probably caused by ~~protestants~~ a heavier emphasis on less self-indulgence in a lot of european cultures.  Italian here. Back home women are more into makeup and fragrances, skincare is still minimal but it‚Äôs becoming more and more popular (also, a lot of facelifts and Botox). Italian guys like to take care of themselves and look good, and as soon they‚Äôll figure out skincare it‚Äôll be booming. 
I‚Äôve introduced my partner to skincare and he loves his little regimen!  Might be, I‚Äôm from Europe (NL) and a lot of my girlfriends don‚Äôt even wash their face or they use bar soap, let alone use sunscreen. I guess back here skincare is just not a ‚Äòthing‚Äô My boyfriend also didn‚Äôt even wash his face, until I started to force him. And he had the worst acne... was on sth similar to accutane. He also has some of the most sun sensitive skin ever, he burns within minutes. I recently started to apply my sunscreen on him too. He‚Äôs German.  My bf is Austrian as well xD and acts just like that.
This winter his face and hands were so so dry.. He wouldn't even put a lip balm on. Makes me cringe but you cant force them..
I hope that my skincare will at least rub on his face a bit when we hug and give it some moisture  :D  ya I think it‚Äôs definitely cultural somehow. I don‚Äôt know. Black men can be the same way. With cabinets full of stuff for their skin and hair. 

Oddly I think Italian men are the only Caucasians I can think of that ever get into hair stuff and skin care more than most. And they can be blonde hair and blue eyes. 

You‚Äôd think the folks prone to aging the earliest would be up on skincare by age 18, so odd. But seems with all these new men lines it‚Äôs coming. 

But if a man is raised to look good to be more confident, and take care of skin and hair, as is how it is with other cultures, it‚Äôs just what they know. We emulate our parents usually, so if they took care then likely we will too. My mom did not so I don‚Äôt know why I do and neither do my half-siblings care like I do. So could be the black and PR part of me somehow lol. I really just have PR hair somehow so I spend more on it than I do skin anymore. I got my retin a and good moisture that‚Äôs good enough. I fell out of the 100$ skin cream stuff since it didn‚Äôt benefit me more than a 25$ one really.  Slightly OT, but I so agree with you, and have always particularly felt this with regards to body hair grooming.  
Everyone's allowed to have their own preferences, of course, but if a dude is telling me he likes ladies sans hair, he darn well better be showing at least GROOMED body hair, if not gone.  


You don't like bush? Really? Then why you sprouting one, bro?  
 I don‚Äôt expect anything, oral hygiene and overall body cleanliness is all I care about. There are dudes who don‚Äôt wash their feet because the shampoo runs down ya NO. I‚Äôm just usually surprised with the rest like... I had no idea men used all this stuff because it‚Äôs just not discussed much? Like I‚Äôve just known many who took care of themselves but didn‚Äôt make it obvious and did so more than women I know. 

Watching a man brush shaving cream on all fancily out of a jar was just well interesting and kinda hot but I got a love of the eras long gone also... I see that made a commercial comeback anyways now.  Styling but he has good hair and goes to a good barber. 

I think vitamins and diet are better for promotion of healthy hair? That‚Äôs my understanding. Same with skin, nails, everything... low copper will cause premature gray and cause iron anemia, also copper is important for collagen. That‚Äôs just 1 (take zinc and have to balance copper and do labs, I advise no one to take any vitamins without routine lab work and professional advisement).  I‚Äôm gonna say more men probably do than people know. I mean I don‚Äôt think guys sit around talking skincare and usually if they use makeup it‚Äôs pretty natural. That anchorman who did that hilarious video was evidence of how men can use makeup to enhance and it not be really obvious. 

I know men who sit to pee a lot but if you ask any in an open group it never happened. Of course the burly manly men who smoke 2 packs a day probably will criticize but men have a lot of skincare lines now and even better, often more affordable, than women‚Äôs for better ingredients really. Pink tax ya know.... My now deceased ex had more hair products than I did also. He went to good salons. He was a tall German dude who‚Äôd even tan here and there to keep color. The money spent on shaving and skin care was quite beyond my understanding at the time given our age gap and he did not look his age probably for a reason. You weren‚Äôt going to see dove or suave and he‚Äôd just wear tees and basketball shorts. So sometimes it‚Äôs unexpected and unannounced.  It might depend, mostly Puerto Rican‚Äôs and Mexicans I knew. When I lived in another state, the city I was in well on Friday and Saturday night in the Mexican part of town men were dressed up in a very oddly fashionable way. But ya, slick hair and good skin galore. Melanin gives good skin by nature though I guess, no one wanna be ashy not even black folk or my triracial self lmao.  Same here. I never even see my pops use lotion at all. Lol Jack Black! It's a lovely lip balm that doesn't break me out around my mouth. Thank you! Yep. And ironically whenever I'm debating pro LGBT arguments like gender dysphoria, trolls assume I'm trans from reading my username. Uncultured swine lol  Yeah I‚Äôm allergic to lavender and try to avoid vitamin E. Barbasol and the female version seem to be a negative. 

I use a men‚Äôs schick when I do it, so definitely notice there is not much difference but female products tend to be loaded with a lot of junk because they just need cheapo stuff to shave their legs. You get E and a load of fragrance. My deceased ex was on a blood thinner and spent quite a lot on good shaving products as a result and had nice skin. I wish I could remember what he used. As I prefer creams to gels and the female market is definitely overloaded with gels (yes that‚Äôs why I get that barbasol type brand for my legs, I‚Äôll never get a knick with cream but will with gels always). I did it only every other week but gave up because those little face razors suck and I could swear I‚Äôd get a new pimple from the cream. Now that I‚Äôm clear I want to stay clear and probably men would know better what is non comedogenic in that area and irritant free. It‚Äôs good exfoliating nonetheless. Probably why men tend to have nicer skin. I didn‚Äôt realize what a difference getting rid of all the peach fuzz made though, especially makeup wise, and I don‚Äôt see skin products shining off the otherwise unnoticeable hairs either. I think women do it more now than they used to, I guess those who can afford to have dermaplaning regularly and plan the time of tretinoin to do so probably have it easier.  No, it‚Äôs an old wives tale that the hair grows back darker and thicker if a woman shaved their face. Literally no possible way to change your hair follicle shaving. I believe during regrowth it can seem that way? Depending on the angle cut. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like the little women‚Äôs face razors, they seem to cut horribly.  Thanks!!

I‚Äôm 38w with a teeny bit of rosacea. I can‚Äôt skip spf anymore can I? And it seems like I need to jump on the Vit C train ASAP.  Wow. Thank you! Well, I‚Äôm a woman. Tbh I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like being called masculine. For example, I should be allowed to keep underarm hair long without being described as masculine like it‚Äôs a slur. I just want to be a female yeti, ya get me? Not a man. It‚Äôs like saying only one gender has ownership over a certain lifestyle. Mr Moneybags over here with his sleeved shirts T shirts would cost me more. How odd. I generally get mine on sale at target though. I‚Äôm fond of the crisp lower thread count because I sleep hot (lower thread count breathes better) and they come in 2 packs. I do sheets once a week so I don‚Äôt need that many anyhow.  Definitely going to have to try them, thank you! I have a complicated relationship with zombies. They're dangerous, but I love their swagger.  I've been wanting to try lanolin, but it's so expensive for something that might not work for me. Where do I find these free samples? Gotcha, I don't really splurge on my hair because it's only a semi permanent feature of me. But I use Garnier Shampoo, then their conditioner, then their leave in conditioner with some argyl oil and a modeling clay for hold. All these products would make one think my morning routine is forever, but shower and face still only take 20min lol Thanks for the in-depth response! Thankfully, I started tretinoin a few weeks ago in my first visit with a derm, and I am thrilled about it :) I'm kinda in the purging stage, but it isn't going too bad thankfully. I can't wait until I hit month 6 or so. I am definitely interested in chemical peels. Are those the same thing as AHAs and BHAs? Any chemical peels you recommend? It's not lol. No shade to OP but he just linked Paula ads as fact.

I was going to say it's a decent place to begin your research, but WTF is this works cited??? Without URL, no author names, no article title, journal volume, or any annotation, this is a lazy, blatant ad. (Could you imagine a reputable scientific article with product links in between paragraphs lmao). 

Most of these are simply unsearchable which completely defeats the purpose of a works cited ("Drug Research October 2016, ePublication"?? Wtf is this first one.) and some of these are utter BS "sources". The November 2012 article on JAAD discusses the harmful effects of UV radiation on the cellular level and the importance of sunscreen, and explores the potential of topical "antioxidants" (does not specify VitC). Written by a consultant for L'Oreal.

 Paula's choice links really bother me when they're presented as fact though. These are advertisements. The sources *seem* good but they're not annotated so it's clear they have them there to seem "scientific" and not out true of academic virtue. I'd much rather the relevant sections of the sources be linked and annotated.  I've always thought "most important first" so I add retinol first but I'm usually too impatient to wait long enough for it to dry before adding the VitC. And it sounds like they both chemically stabilize each other so that shouldn't be a problem. Why not both in AM and PM? I use the new coconut water Thayer's in a mister to dampen my face before applying moisturizer, especially if it contains hyaluronic acid since that requires a layer of moisture to work properly. So long story short, no it does not dry quickly. I use it as an extra moisture layer. Well I hope you find a dragon lady to get you beer Amen to that. When we look good to ourselves we just have more confidence. It‚Äôs not about anyone else. It‚Äôs hard to explain to people sometimes, I don‚Äôt care what others think about my appearance, I do!  [deleted] It‚Äôs not really self indulgence, especially skin care. Being dry and flakey is not comfortable and to not wear sunscreen is just asking for cancer by people with blue/green eyes given their genetic mutation. 

Might as well do away with soaps and deodorant, makeup, all too self indulgent? Lol.  Yeah I thin it maybe has to do with winter? I know since moving here I‚Äôve been told I should shower less because that‚Äôs causing my dry skin and you can get away with not showering everyday here but in parts of southern Mexico, Central American etc you have to shower everyday. Some people shower two or three times a day because of heat. I think that might influence daily hygiene but I don‚Äôt know. Could be completely wrong I would not live in misery of itchy hell for any man, hell to the no. I trim and shave bikini, that‚Äôs all. But I don‚Äôt like men to shave that either so guess on equal ground there. I‚Äôm so sick of men trying to say I have to shave it, whether they do or don‚Äôt I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm not an 8 year old girl and don‚Äôt want to be when HELL it itches and the stubble catches on undies ya no thanks. I won‚Äôt be shaving it when I‚Äôm 70 either so if that‚Äôs a demand I know it‚Äôs not a long term thing.  Whats a good diet for hair and skin care? Ahh I see. I do use primer and they make my skin looks less oily and kinda smoother? Makes pores less visible too Ahhh ok, so man doing skincare will make them look younger as well? I am gonna do it. Now I just moisturize and use sunscreen and for face I use moisturizer and nicotiamide and at night I use vitamin c and moisturizer I guess. Sometimes during the day I will use make up primer lol triracial here too and that‚Äôs what i think. black dont crack cuz black is moisturized lol Also, whenever you start a new product, wait a week before beginning another. This way, if you get a rash or break out, you know what product to change! wow you‚Äôre the whole package üò≠ Yeah the multi-blade razor Schick or Mach is a bad idea and the foam in a can is likewise a bad idea...  no sleeves necessary You‚Äôre welcome :) Every day is Earth Day when you're a zombie.  Anywhere babies/preggoes are. When I was pregnant with each of my kids & pretty much their whole toddlerhood....never ending free samples. 
  [deleted] > Why not both in AM and PM? 

Whoa I never even considered that as an option. I'll try it and see what my skin thinks! So do I shelfie man...so do I. So much this. I wasted too many years caring what others thought of my grooming.   


I think a radiant, confident person who loves their own being will always look 'good' to others, even if it's 'quirky' or 'different' in style. it costs zero (0) dollars to read up on the history of europe and religion online.  Omg yes it catches on your panties! It's the worst! I've never heard anyone else say that though üòÇ I only shaved a couple times and that's why I won't do it now. Fuck that.  See I am the opposite. I hate any and all excess body hair. Always have. It just bothered me. I like my dudes the same. Don't mind it at all on others, folks must always be comfy in their own skin... but like I said I appreciate it groomed rather than wild if it's there. Never even liked the scruffy chin stubble look on dudes.

And the cool thing here is none of us are wrong. And none of us are asking anything of a partner we don't do... to do otherwise is such hypocrisy and I cannot stand it. 'Be bald' as a scraggy beard slowly melds with wild pubes....


And a slight aside... razor issues is why I went with laser hair removal. My word is it a world from that itchy regrowth. No idea how dudes who shave daily with razors do it. Nutrient dense of course because so many building blocks for good skin are in vitamins and minerals from diet. And keeping well hydrated with water. 

I know pizza and chocolate are kinda myths at causing acne really but my suggestion is wash your hands before touching your face when you eat that stuff or anything buttery. I never noticed acne when I indulge, but I‚Äôm not gonna touch my face with grease on my fingers ya know? Chocolate is actually good for skin and hair (dark cocoa especially) because it‚Äôs high in minerals like copper. Cocoa nibs are a good snack IMO.  Yeah I do that with one of the urban decay primers when I don‚Äôt want to wear makeup, though I have dry skin I do sweat and am quite annoyed my HG powder seems to be gone forever (too faced cocoa powder, was dry skin friendly) so if I ever wear foundation the UD naked with the tarte setting powder works.

But that guy contoured and used eyeshadow and blush even, it can all look natural and real, even with us women. I have natural eyeshadow, so I‚Äôve been asked if I had some makeup on when I didn‚Äôt so kinda shows some coloring does look natural. Like he said, blend man blend blend blend lol.  Hydrating skin in general, both inside and out, helps prevent lines or gets rid of dry skin lines from facial expressions. I raise my brows a lot (well worked on that a lot) and just moisturizing my forehead made a marked difference before I started tret, pretty much gone at this point. I only drink water but some coffee (antioxidants and neuroprotective reasons). Never anything else. Have to hydrate inside which so many forget and end up with dehydrated skin rather than just dry. 

I like urban decay primer. I can use it solo and it evens out things a bit cause it‚Äôs a slight tint but looks like no makeup. They have a BB also. Both always made my skin so soft. Pretty sure their BB has peptides but again isn‚Äôt something for heavy duty coverage so won‚Äôt be noticeable. Neither is the naked foundation but man it always makes my skin glow and the only brand that actually matches my skin color (3.25) besides Mac studio concealer. I‚Äôd suggest going to sephora for samples of primers, they‚Äôll give 3 at a time to try out. Same with skin care products, which is good so I don‚Äôt end up returning so much. Probably why they do it really.  ya genes also play a role. Being pale and blue eyed is just a result of genetic mutation that causes lack of melanin and increases risk of skin cancer. Pale folk age about 10 years earlier than those with darker skin. Just life. Being dried out isn‚Äôt gonna do anyone any favors.  I can‚Äôt really agree with the first part... except when people practice poor razor hygiene. The razor itself can cause acne. And ingrown hairs as well. 
The second part, yes... I do agree.  I have saved your comment and will keep your warning very much in mind. I can't wait to start using more products, but I definitely do not want to irritate my skin. For now, at least my wallet is keeping me at bay LOL. You have been very helpful, so thank you so much! :) I admit I have severe adhd so if I have zero interest in something it‚Äôs difficult to spend time reading about it. While I do have a large amount of useless knowledge it‚Äôs mostly science related or even mathematics. 

I‚Äôd rather read about clouds for an hour, light bulbs, well even Caligula or something more interesting than more religion. I did have my stint there because non-Christian religions are not common (and JWs do interest me and oddly do care about appearance). Christianity is fascinating because of all the denominations that argue with each other, but I lack the interest to try to dig up why specific Protestant denominations don‚Äôt practice hygiene or care about their skin. When I remember being fascinated with the Tudor and Elizabethan eras and seems a bit different... 

Muslim women practice skincare here, all while being fully covered. So it is doubly confusing how Lutherans or Methodists specifically would not bother with skin care. Many Hispanics are catholic and many blacks are Christians. I don‚Äôt see the correlation whatsoever. But if you‚Äôd care to explain rather than say google why European Christians with blue eye mutations don‚Äôt like skincare that‚Äôd be more useful.  Yep, if I trim too short it‚Äôs a reminder. Then next thing out and public and want to scratch or adjust LOL sucksssss ya I prefer to save the money and just trim and makes me feel like a woman. I don‚Äôt know. I tend to date a bit older where they usually are more of a trim and that‚Äôs all type also. I like chest hair on a man, I will lay my head and run my hands and fingers over it. And also don‚Äôt mind the stubble, or maintained facial hair. Weird, I guess I see it as a manly thing. I just notice men around my age and younger expect this bald thing as a standard, ya nope. Not even dating them, just in general conversation I‚Äôve come across ‚Äúwomen are supposed to shave down there‚Äù well I guess many of us didn‚Äôt get the memo. I know many young women not shaving anything anymore, but I gotta shave my armpits and legs cause then they are itchy if hairy rubbing against clothing, I guess men just are used to it and maybe if I never shaved them I‚Äôd not be bothered. Shrug guess that‚Äôs a sensory issue now. Since I mostly wear pants I don‚Äôt need to shave my legs and just my calves/knee anyways. 

I just can‚Äôt stand the blonde hairs on my face. Especially since lemonade health quit doing my retin a scripts cause of it LOL I did have to say, not a single woman has zero hair on their face. I notice different wording on other places that leads me to believe they meant recent dark hair growth on the lip and chin vs just general peach fuzz because PCOS causes acne I guess. Though they ban you forever after that. So now I‚Äôm like always wanting to shave my face cause somehow it made me self conscious moreso having blonde fuzz on my face. My almost 5 year old has peach fuzz for the matter. Eye rolllllll. Lol.  Wow, interesting, maybe i should try some if you‚Äôre not willing to read up on it, then you really shouldn‚Äôt be jumping into talks completely uninformed on the subject. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

you especially shouldn‚Äôt be if you‚Äôre freely willing to admit you have no desire to educate yourself on the subject, and imply religion isn‚Äôt interesting *or* important‚Äî when, the whole reason you don‚Äôt understand is because you don‚Äôt know about christian religion. 

the simple fact is that it‚Äôs super quick to find results and answers by googling this, way faster than it took to type your reply.

sorry, but i‚Äôm not going to waste time telling you when you freely admit you don‚Äôt care: it‚Äôs a waste of my free time. if you want to learn, it costs zero dollars and less than two hours of your time to learn on your own why this is. 

edit: typo.  That's whack about the hair. Everyone has facial hair. I‚Äôm actually Christian and know a good chunk about it. That‚Äôs the issue. You said google European (very broad) Christian history to find out why they don‚Äôt generally practice any sort of skin hygiene, cancer prevention, makeup, whatever, and consider it self indulgent. You don‚Äôt clarify which country, denomination, time period, etc, which in case you are unaware, Europe is not small, history is not short, and Christian denominations are in the hundreds. All that time you took and yet you could have said what you needed to, ya?

I have not run across any such notion before, not even amongst the most conservative that would not wear a V neck top but certainly practice hygiene and wear sunscreen, ya know? The body is a temple after all. You are asking to google for something on which would probably take hours to find anything more than opinion on. Even the Protestant Queens of England ‚Äúindulged‚Äù in makeup. So perhaps specify era as well, beyond all the rest of the vagueness. 

Do you comprehend how many countries are in Europe and also that they all do not share the same Christian religion? Ireland for example.... so I‚Äôm supposed to dig for whatever country, time period, weirdo man made religious ideology that contradicts the Bible, because you‚Äôd rather complain I don‚Äôt want to? Okie dokie. 

For further reference, I don‚Äôt tell people to just go google things that I am actually knowledgeable on so to me when someone tells me to, I know they don‚Äôt even have a clue what they are talking about and yep, no interest.  I forgot to note, one may Google ‚Äúwhat is Iberian peninsula‚Äù given my previous commentary. Shrug. 

I could also spend 2 hours educating my child on math vs google broad, unspecified, subjects leading to no real conclusion since there is no real subject at hand. I think the former has a better outcome, overall, so I don‚Äôt have a kid that needs to google Pythagorean‚Äôs theory and just knows it, and I shall teach her better people skills that is a definite!

Funny, someone asked me earlier what the difference between 2 medical terms was. Instead of telling them to google it and being a jerk because they know I already knew, I simply explained in detail. Then landed in an hour long conversation of 2 people gaining knowledge. What a concept. Takes 0$ to be a decent person. If you care what people know you will give them facts and pull up supporting evidence if necessary. That is how informative discussion works. ‚ÄúJust google it‚Äù = ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any way to give details/explanation but I think I know what I‚Äôm talking about‚Äù.  > You don‚Äôt clarify which country, denomination, time period, etc. 

here‚Äôs the comment you first responded to, bolded for your comprehension:

‚Äúi‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just cultural differences, **caused by ~~protestants~~ a heavier emphasis on less self-indulgence in a lot of european cultures.**

> I have not run across any such notion before (...) which would probably take hours to find anything more than opinion on. 

[nope](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=protestantism+in+europe). 

> Do you comprehend how many countries are in Europe and also that they do not share the same Christian religion?

no actually, i‚Äôm a complete fool who was locked in a basement and just escaped two weeks ago. i live in the woods, have never seen a computer before, can‚Äôt type, and communicate in a series of growls like the Tethered from *Us.* i‚Äôve never seen a map, ever, and i kill deer with my mutant, rotting teeth for breakfast. 

> (...) so I‚Äôm supposed to dig for whatever country, time period, (...)

yes, you are, based on the context you glean from reading and comprehending the comment thread: my comments, the person i was replying to, talking about their **austrian** boyfriend. you know, like how you comprehend how their are multiple countries in europe, a unique skill among many that is not common among the world population at all. 

> (...) and I shall teach her better people skills  [sic] that is a definite!

can you teach her better reading skills and how to broaden her horizons, while you‚Äôre at it? better yet, maybe [how to google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=protestantism+in+europe). 

> (...) [It] Takes 0$ [sic] to be a decent person.

i am double majoring at a catholic college, and have taken two theology courses taught by monks with doctorates from rome in, respectively, moral theology and religious history. i very recently finished an eight page paper, which covered the link between protestantism and capitalism and its implications for modern society, contemporary examples, and the importance of the theories laid out by its author, german 1800‚Äôs sociologist max weber, in scientific research. in addition, i am an archival research assistant for a professor on my campus with a focus on studying the history of the influce of catholic policy on schools; i interact with nuns weekly. lastly, i‚Äôm a fucking unitarian christian‚Äî a sect of christianity founded in romania, a country in europe, **by a fucking protestant monk.**

grill me a goddamn cheese. To summarize,

I directly replied to you but the reply was regarding another individual and their specific comment even though on Reddit a reply to an individual doesn‚Äôt show all the prior comments beforehand. In such case, Christians/Catholics of bygone eras in Austria aye. Except, it‚Äôs contradictory to Catholic theology to not take proper care of one‚Äôs body, but that‚Äôs generally the case so not surprising. 

And I say it on the internet so it must be true. Cue: I glossed over and realize you need a hobby of sorts. 

Lastly, I don‚Äôt really care what your religion is. I very recently finished a 13 page paper on why no one cares. True story.  Google what a skin flute is for me and perhaps you‚Äôll come to understand why I‚Äôd never want anyone to rely on Google. Literally someone believed it was a real instrument thanks to the nonsensical googling advice and the whole ‚ÄúI can write what I want on the internet and it‚Äôs here so it must be true‚Äù. Case in point, your rambling. No educated person would site google as a source BUT there are many out there with google and wiki PhDs so does not surprise me. 

*breaks out popcorn for next windy response* [deleted] Oh you have ADHD according to your profile. Probably inattentive type and explains a lot. Cause it was a grown 50+ man who read a title and went with it. But sure, yeah, was totally a 4 year old who googled skin flute. Face palm. Insult a toddler, sure, at least she knows math. Talk about reading comprehension because clouds to me are more interesting than digging for why Austrian Catholics think hygiene is self indulgence and why that even matters. Yes, I will take elementary science over your theology any day. 

Seems you need a psychologist with nonsensical ramblings and no life but since you‚Äôre diagnosed seems you‚Äôre no better off, eh? Certified and no better than anyone. Damn, knocked off the high horse.  Oh good lord you are barely a legal adult in the state of Nebraska. Block time. Wish they‚Äôd do with this like they do with smoking and make it 21+ at minimum. For flips sake. Go take your adderall kiddo and do the needful.  *eats popcorn* 

I‚Äôm glad you put all that effort in for me to not read it. You do need a hobby besides google and social media. Kids these days... >Cause it was a grown 50+ man (...)

try again, you‚Äôre not a 50+ man: your comment and post history places you as a ~gen x-er early baby boomer NY living woman who likes her bikini line kept neat and her CFS and ADHD well taken care of. 

> Austrian Catholics

point me to where i talked about austrian catholicism. you can‚Äôt, because i didn‚Äôt- and also because apparently you‚Äôre more interested in copying and pasting abraisive answers from your clipboard onto reddit forums. maybe, just maybe, the next comment you post five minutes from now will be the one that finally makes all that internet bullying and ignorance of social life worth it, because lord knows that this one won‚Äôt made you feel better (nor will your next tricked out vape, mind you). and maybe, just maybe, your next comment will fix your inferiority complex that makes you believe everyone‚Äôs secretly harboring a prideful chip on your shoulder. 

oh well, looks like this attempt at bullying wasn‚Äôt the one. looks like a right failure from my end, especially because all this could have been solved by picking up your bootstraps and using all two brain cells of reading comprehension to learn about protestanism‚Äôs history in europe like i recommended. 

i get it, not like there‚Äôs anything else to do asides get addicted to social media and hurting others to feel better when your life revolves around vaping and complaining online about how tretinoin isn‚Äôt a magic bullet like you thought it was. happy napping! take your adderall, lord knows it helps with the dopamine and fatigue.  **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Skin type - combination (although bordering on dry these days), acne prone, sensitive   
Concerns - texture, mild scarring, hormonal acne, redness, wrinkles (aka everything lol)  
   
Josie Maran Whipped Argan Oil Butter - I‚Äôve been using this moisturiser for a long time. I live in the U.K. now and it‚Äôs not sold or shipped here, so I have to have it shipped to my mom‚Äôs house in the US and then have her mail it to me or I pick some up while I‚Äôm visiting the States. It‚Äôs the priciest product I use ($40) but it lasts a long time. There‚Äôs no scent. It‚Äôs maybe a little heavy for daytime use for a lot of people. I‚Äôve never had dry skin until moving to Scotland so it works well for me here. I‚Äôve tried other moisturisers but they‚Äôve either (1) not been moisturising enough or (2) have broken me out. I have recently been trying TO‚Äôs moisturising factors for daytime use and that‚Äôs been working ok. Not sure if I‚Äôll stick with it yet. Maybe for summer.   
  
TO‚Äôs Argan Oil - I was using Josie Maran‚Äôs Argan oil but it‚Äôs expensive and I‚Äôve found TO‚Äôs to work just as well for a fraction of the price. A lot of people complain about the smell (describing it as barnyard-y?) but it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all and I‚Äôm extremely sensitive to smells. I use it as my first cleansing step and massage it into my skin for a couple minutes. I‚Äôve found it to be really hydrating especially after switching from it from micellar water.  
  
Treclin - I‚Äôve been using for ~10 weeks. I never *really* purged and was feeling impatient about seeing results but I‚Äôm finally seeing some changes!! I wish I had started sooner. I‚Äôll probably switch over to regular tret in a few months because I‚Äôve read you can develop a tolerance to the clindamycin, but I‚Äôm playing that by ear.   
  
TO‚Äôs Niacinamide - I‚Äôve been using this to help fade spots. I put it on AM and PM. I‚Äôve not had any bad reaction to it, but it seems to be either HG or horrible.  
  
Cerave Hydrating Cleanser - to be honest there‚Äôs nothing that special about this cleanser. I‚Äôve been using it for years because when I‚Äôve tried to swap it out my skin has not reacted well. It doesn‚Äôt really seem to be that hydrating, but it works well enough.  
  
TO‚Äôs AHA/BHA mask - I don‚Äôt really use this often because I‚Äôm using the retinol, but I will use it sometimes on my nose for blackheads which seems to help but hasn‚Äôt completely gotten rid of them.  
  
Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium - I just got this in the mail about a week ago, but I‚Äôm really liking it so far. I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôve seen that ‚Äúwow‚Äù difference like some people have but it does seem to noticeably hydrate my skin. I‚Äôll need to try it a little longer to say for sure!  
  
Purito Centella Unscented spf - Received this in the Yesstyle order with the Hada Labo. I can‚Äôt say for sure how great it is for coverage (although people seem to love it here!) but my skin hasn‚Äôt had any issues with it! It doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast, it‚Äôs hydrating, and no irritation!  
  
Not pictured:  
Revolution Caffeine solution - I‚Äôve been using this for a few weeks now but I‚Äôm not sure how much of a difference I‚Äôm seeing. I keep applying anyways just in case.   
Soon Jung Barrier Intensive Cream - tried this last night for the first time and no bad reaction. Skin was looking hydrated but it could have been another product. Time will tell.   
Spironolactone 100mg/day - could not live without this 
Innisfree masks  
Cosrx acne pimple patches Yup. My skin has never looked brighter. The break from makeup helps too since I have not worn any makeup in over two weeks. The public needs to see this face! Mine is awful! Probably stress and anxiety though. I wouldn't be surprised if reducing pollution and sunlight has a positive effect. (Don't forget to take vitamin D) Same! I‚Äôve had more time to spend on my skincare routine. My skin is looking great, and I have nowhere to be! Just found TO. Really excited to try their stuff. It's my firm belief that my bad skin days are caused by my (London underground) commute, and my excessively air conditioned office. I've been signed off work since early December, and my skin has never been better! how do you use the ordinary AHA mask while on tret? everytime I use it my skin freaks out for weeks Have been using the scented version of that sunscreen for 12 months and absolutely love it. No white cast, and leaves my skin feeling great! Sunscreen and lip mask twinnsss. Love my Purito! How do you like that Laneige lip mask?? I just ordered it because my lips are dry and flaky regardless of the amount of chapstick and stuff I put on them. Lip masks have been highly recommended to me so I‚Äôm wondering how it‚Äôs treating you? I love argan oil! I use it for my hair as it makes it really soft afterwards. 

I want to try the centella unscented spf but it‚Äôs out of stock atm :( I used to use JM Argan oil until I moved to Colorado. I needed a heavier, more moisturizing cream. Now I use rose hip oil as my last step to seal everything in and it‚Äôs done wonders. 

Also super jealous you live in Scotland. I went on vacation there 3 years ago and loved it! Sunscreen game is on point, I see. I thought wearing no make up for weeks would help me but my skin is worse than ever!! >:( I'm getting cystic acne right now


The older i get, my skin is getting worse? I'm seriously considering not removing my unibrow anymore because every goddamn time I seem to break out despite using clean tools and washing my face before doing so... Your skins looking great *because* you stay indoor üòÇ People: you‚Äôre so lucky to have naturally good skin

*my medicine cabinet full of skincare and my strict gluten/dairy free diet*: ARE WE A JOKE TO YOU I feel the same. I just found a routine that worked for my hormonal acne: Biore Charcoal Acne Cleanser, CeraVe Ceramide moisturizer (I have the Walmart brand, works the same) The Ordinary‚Äôs Azelaic Acid, and Desitin Zinc Oxide Cream. Nothing has worked as good as these and I‚Äôm really happy with the results! Same here, sister. Meh, give it until the next period and it'll look gross again. Works for me anyway. Yes!!! The josie maran argan oil is my absolute favorite face moisturizer and i‚Äôve never seen anyone use and/or talk about it!!! I wish TO's Niacanimide worked for me, but sadly I broke out in a bunch of closed comedones :( on the positive side, I'm now using an AHA/BHA toner again to try and banish them, and early results seem positive! I swear to god my skin has never looked so clean and smooth in months. And I also haven‚Äôt seen anyone in person in the past 2 weeks. Hope y‚Äôall can see my poreless complexion on Zoom. Hi I'm very new to this. What is TO that everyone is referring to? Thanks üòä I've been using that hada labo premium for a few years and I do notice a HUGE difference in overall radiance when I stop using it. Just got TO niacinamide less than a week ago and I can't even believe how much a difference it has already made! Also have been using CeraVe hydrating cleanser and the Laneige sleeping mask for awhile, too. I might try that argan oil moisturizer! You're post just inspired me! I have the same TO peel and haven't used it in months, definitely doing that tonight! I‚Äôve thought the same thing for myself! My skin improved so much when I didn't have to go out and put my face in horrible car pollution every day Gurl same ahaha I had a glow up right when quarantine time startedüòÇüòÇ Where did you get the treclin from? It‚Äôs the outside that makes the skin look ‚Äúbad‚Äù 
It‚Äôs safer at home. Controlled environment. Ya feel just bought the ordinary for the first time last night, same things as you except i got the rosehip seed oil That lip mask is everything! The Jose Marian lotion I‚Äôve been wanting to try- what are your thoughts ? it's literally bc we get to rest lol...so unfair [deleted] Pro tip: Argan/Marula oil can be purchased at candle/soap making suppliers for same quality (cold pressed and organic) for much cheaper price.  Stash in fridge until ready to decant. ‚úåÔ∏è did you have acne before treclin? How do you feel about the Purito sunscreen? [deleted] Same. But I‚Äôm also doing all the skincare right now lol your skin is ssoo pretty
i thought staying home would improve my skin but sleeping late has just made it worse haha How is the Cerave hydrating cleanser similar or different from the Cetaphil cleanser? Thanks How often do you use tretinoin? I'm on 0.025 too! The lip mask you have is fake. Felt like I was looking at my skincare lineup, I use 6 out of those 9 products! I looove the gold Hada Labo stuff. I see CeraVe a lot, is it really that good? I have normal skin, only my forehead tends to shine sometimes too much haha maybe that's because I have combination skin. Still not sure yet ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

but I'd love to try it out! Dude, your skin looks amazing, take it from a stranger on reddit with no qualifications I‚Äôm a dude, and I don‚Äôt know anything about skin care

I‚Äôm bored during quarantine and want to learn: Can you explain each of the items and it‚Äôs use, one by one ?

Thank you

Edit: Nvm, I see you‚Äôve already done it. You look great, I approve I bet if you cleared off that shelf people could see it better. s a m e Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium is one of those stealth products--I think it isn't doing much, then I quit and realize it was essential. Not only does it puff up the tired spots, but it definitely contributes to the glass skin effect. I immediately look sunken and muddy when I skip it. I bought the TO Argan oil when it was very first released and it smelled so bad that I assumed it was off and didn‚Äôt use it. I‚Äôd completely forgotten about that until I read your barnyard comment! Guess it was fine after all. What does the hada labo premium do? I thought it was a hyaluronic acid How is that Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask? I use their lavender water sleeping face mask and really love it but I‚Äôve been eyeballing the lip one as well. Thanks for the comprehensive routine! For the spironolactone, do you take in two divided 50mg doses or 100mg all at one time? Has any product in particular helped with redness? Haha same! Hoping it lasts through the quarantine, but my skin will decide to break out the day it‚Äôs over üôÑ Mine is also the best its ever been! Lol but in my case its not the lack of make up! My skin just decided to be clear now so I am even more annoyed when it will break out when quarantine ends. **Conspiracy** Same ! That and the fact that I struggle to keep a skincare routine without a routine. I don't wake up / go to bed at the same time each day, don't shower or eat consistently. I hate this. True! Also I definitely need to - thanks for the reminder :-) I'm a redhead so take supplements all year, but definitely a great point! Also they are paying employees during the pandemic!! Maybe the stress from commuting and working in the office contributed too, because I‚Äôve noticed improvement working from home as well I‚Äôll only use it on my nose now tbh. It‚Äôs helped with blackheads but not completely. But then I won‚Äôt apply tret there that night. It‚Äôs never bothered me there but I‚Äôd say it would if I applied it all over. I‚Äôm able to use the mask 1x/week and tret every night except for the night I use the mask It might just be too strong for your skin. I use it once every other week and I skip my Retin-A the day before, day of, and day after. When my skin is being really finicky, I only use it for 10 minutes and follow with Origins Drink-Up Overnight Mask. Not OP, but I found the Laneige to be very similar to my nightly Aquaphor in effect. The packaging is cute and the bubble-gum flavor is fun, but the result is really no different from an inexpensive petroleum product. My lips were always dry and flakey no matter what. (For years!) I solved it by using the Milani sugar lip scrub, (specifically this one, I‚Äôve tried others and none do the job) and using either a lip treatment/sleeping mask or my jack black lip balm afterwards. (: Forgot to review that one! I really like it. There are few lip balms that I feel like show such a quick improvement I hate splurging on non essential products, but the lip mask is awesome! Will definitely buy again and again! I even bought the lip gloss Have you tried Yesstyle? That‚Äôs where I got mine what rosehip oil do you use? I‚Äôve been wanting to try adding it into my routine!  
  
Colorado is super beautiful too :-) I‚Äôm actually from KY but I‚Äôve been living here for a couple years now! Glad you think so :-) I kept waiting for my skin to get better as I got older but it wasn‚Äôt happening haha. I recommend giving tret a try :-) wish I would‚Äôve started sooner Lol same except no one compliments my skin That‚Äôs so great! I‚Äôve been wanting to try the azelaic acid! Hahaha same ugh Same here! I really love it. I don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs on the pricier side because it‚Äôs great and lasts a long time! I‚Äôve seen a lot of other people say that about the niacinamide! What brand is the toner? The ordinary! The Ordinary, it's a brand of very affordable but solid quality skincare products. It's the dropper-style bottles in OP's pic with white tops and labels. I originally got it from dermatica but switched to an online pharmacy I‚Äôve been wanting to try that! Let me know how it goes :-) I‚Äôve been using it for a couple years now! I really like it. It‚Äôs also the only moisturiser that hasn‚Äôt irritated my skin and/or has been moisturising enough. It‚Äôs a bit pricy though (but one jar lasts me ~6 months) and also not available in the U.K. (not sure where you are - might be available elsewhere outside the US/Canada) - I have to stock up every time I go back to the US. Also I mix in a couple drops of TO Rosehip oil into it every night and it‚Äôs amazing We have a trip to mediterranean planned in July and I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôre still able to go because I‚Äôve been sooooo excited for some sunshine (we live in Scotland). My skin always looks its best with some sun and ocean salt. Good to know! I think I paid ¬£6 for this one, but I‚Äôll keep an eye out :-) Yes but it was usually pretty mild. My skin was almost totally clear besides a cystic pimple once a month from my period UNTIL I moved to the U.K. a couple years ago and then it started breaking out again. It wasn‚Äôt too bad - usually pretty mild - but then sometimes, seemingly out of nowhere, it would get worse. I just wore it for the first time today but I like it a lot so far! No white cast, no irritation! Quite hydrating too. I use one pump. It lasts me at least 6 months, maybe longer? It lasts long enough that I don‚Äôt notice haha. Also I put on the niacinamide after cleansing and tret! Also ask away :-) (although I‚Äôm obviously not an expert) I tried the Cetaphil cleanser once and it broke me out :-( but someone else may be able to give a better answer! I use it every night! I started out using it once or twice a week at first and really eased into it. How do you know? I just got it and I‚Äôm really liking it so far! To be honest, it‚Äôs not something I love, but my skin breaks out if I try something else so I‚Äôve just accepted it as part of my routine I mean I can post a before and after photo if that would be helpful for people! How do you use this? Yeah my skin texture goes down the pan when I stop using it! You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve got till it‚Äôs gone I guess! Do you use the essence or emulsion...? I have both coming in the post. I read reviews saying it smelled bad so I think it made me expect the worst and then it wasn‚Äôt so bad. Also I used to use the sulphur spot treatment from Kate Somerville so I think I can withstand more now haha I know it has 5 types of HA plus urea. It‚Äôs for hydration. It‚Äôs been good for me because my skin tends to be dehydrated! I was looking for something that made it more bouncy and plump? I really like it! I ordered just a mini size to give it a try, but it looks like I‚Äôll be purchasing the full size with my next yesstyle order :-) Absolutely a must have in any skincare routine. Apply on chapped lips before bed and the morning they look brand new. And it will last forever! 100mg at once at night! I used to take it in the AM but it was making me dizzy and I haven‚Äôt had issues since. I‚Äôve been on it for 7-8 years and it‚Äôs had such a huge impact on my hormonal acne after being diagnosed with PCOS Not op but I split mine up because taking 100mg at once made me super light headed every time I got up To be honest, not too much. I have really reactive skin in general and I think tret has been helping with evening out my skin tone and texture. But it‚Äôs also made my skin more sensitive so sometimes it gets extra red, like after going outside in the winds here I‚Äôll get really flushed. Same, some days I don't shower/wash my face until evening. My schedule is all messed up! that was me on week one of the quarantine. but i rallied when i forced myself to look at it as such an amazing opportunity for my skincare routine to step it up‚Äîno excuses. i‚Äôve been detoxing from makeup, staying diligent about my moisturizing, sun protection, masks, and treatments, and have forced myself to drink more water and get outside for a little fresh air every day. my determination to get on top of all of my skincare issues is all that‚Äôs keeping me going actually lol That's so great to hear! Now I'm even happier to have found them. Hmm. Good to know as well. Thanks for the input! I agree, I don‚Äôt like the added ‚Äúplumping‚Äù effect of laniege. I won‚Äôt be repurchasing and instead will buy aquaphor This sub is so helpful!! Thank you mucho! I saw the jack black stuff but I didn‚Äôt know where to start so I am so thankful for all the recommendations. Bless you all, seriously Good to know! Thankful to hear it‚Äôs been treating you well. Thanks for the quick little review! Well I bought a bottle on amazon last year or the year before, art naturals, and I just ran out. I got a bottle from good molecules but it‚Äôs very small so when it‚Äôs gone I‚Äôll see if I can get the same brand on amazon again. 

What made you move out there ?  What part of Scotland are you in? I put it over the ceramide moisturizer so it‚Äôs not too irritating. I usually find that it‚Äôs better that way. I‚Äôve had it sting so much without doing that.

Mostly the HG product that‚Äôs really worked is the Desitin lmao. I might switch to the niacinamide from the ordinary instead of the azelaic acid as I feel it worked a bit better on me. i usually just buy the one meant for your body because it‚Äôs cheaper. i honestly think they‚Äôre the same thing, one is just advertised for your face I'm using Neutrogena's Pore Refining Toner. I used to go alcohol free all the way, but I wanted something a bit more astringent.

That, combined with azelaic acid, has made a good dent in my current worry I wouldn't be able to control a descent into skin chaos! I was on roaccutane years ago so I'm a bit of a worrier :) Thank you!! what kind of acne did you have before tret? i‚Äôm terrified of the purge, i have a few closed comedones and that‚Äôs about it. a red spot here and there Oh my. How is the texture of the 2 different from each other? Maybe theyve changed it but usually the lid isnt thinner than the actual tub. I got my last one a while ago and I've always noticed when I buy them the lid is same width as tub. Ahh okay, thanks for the response!! I use it as my second step, after serum and before cream. In summer, I skip the cream if it's very humid or if I'm very oily. I use this as my second to last step, I spritz my face with rosewater and then spread it on my face, then put my moisturizer on while my face is still damp with the rosewater and the serum. I like to ‚Äúlock in‚Äù the serum and the rosewater with my moisturizer! The essence. my bff always gives me her pricey skincare products that are too good to let go to waste, but have smells she couldn‚Äôt tolerate even for more than a day. i brace myself for the worst, and have never had an issue. have gotten some real nice stuff that way lol Yea that‚Äôs what I heard it was for too but just checking bc I can‚Äôt read the ingredients 

Do you apply the Premium on wet skin? So you didn‚Äôt have any issues taking it all at once? Your doctor prescribed it as once a day? Did you experience any difference in the effects after splitting them up? You‚Äôre welcome! I use the Milani lip scrub about once a week or more if I feel I need it. It‚Äôs super inexpensive and lasts forever. I‚Äôve panned only two of them in a couple of years, I order mine from Amazon. It‚Äôs super delicious too! I also recommended using a small spatula or a clean Bobby pin to ‚Äústir‚Äù the product the first day you get it. It comes with the sugar settled at the bottom for some reason, once you stir it once you won‚Äôt need to again. (: 
I use a warm wash cloth to remove it after scrubbing and then apply my lip balm or treatment. Cystic acne on my chin around my period mostly. Usually once a month. Maybe a whitehead or two. Nothing too major. I didn‚Äôt purge at all really. Even if you do I promise it‚Äôs worth It!!! Now would be a good time to start if you can (I order mine from an online pharmacy) because you‚Äôre quArantined in case you do purge! I just looked it up and it seems like you may be right. I ordered from Yesstyle - I‚Äôm not sure if this is an issue with them üòï oh interesting. I've been wanting to try this and I've read some people put drops in their moisturizer. I like your way too! Thanks! Have you guys took a whiff of Sunday Riley‚Äôs UFO mask? Wheeew. I found it best to apply it on wet/damp skin because the HA would attract the water n pull it into my skin. No I don‚Äôt because I apply it after the tretinoin I started out at a lower dose but then got bumped up to 100mg/day. But yes my doctor has only ever prescribed it as once a day. I didn‚Äôt know people did it twice a day to be honest Yeah! It helped with the lightheadedness no, but the sunday riley CEO glow vitamin C oil was one of the products my friend gave me that she couldn‚Äôt stand the smell of (i think cuz of the turmeric that‚Äôs in it?), and i loved it. didn‚Äôt really mind the smell at all. is this a sunday riley thing‚Äîdo a lot of their products not smell good? I‚Äôll have to try this. I was wondering whether it would affect the tret if I applied it beforehand. Got it! Thank you very much! Oh sorry, I meant acne wise - one way isn‚Äôt better than the other? I think it‚Äôs because of the active ingredients! The cleanser smells like clay, the ufo mask is straight sulfur, but damn their products work so good. Nope Thank you!! **Hi everyone!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Hey, that‚Äôs so funny!! I‚Äôm a new medical student myself and lately my routine has been my salty tears (: I actually really want to try the Clinique jelly! Because I normally use bosica cactus and love it but it is quite pricey for the small amount compared to Clinique. Great routine - simple and effective. MS4 here, I use 3/4 of the products in this pic. Haha I noticed you mentioned the Clinique jelly for your skin peeling. I have sensitive dry skin and I‚Äôm always so flaky. What is it you like about the jelly for dry skin? How did you acclimate to tretinoin given you‚Äôre redness and sensitivity? I want to make the plunge but I‚Äôm anxious about my skin going haywire. Have you used any of the other Clinique moisturizers? I know the lotion and gel formulas are popular but I haven't tried them. I think the jelly is newer but I"m not sure how it compares to the original gel. I ordered Curology and I'm anxious to see how it goes. I use like 7 different products currently so I'm excited to ditch that Hello everyone, I've spent a lot of time paring down my routine to the literature-supported essentials in the past few months. I often spend upwards of 70-80 hours a week in the hospital (now with a mask covering most of my face), so I focus on spending more time sleeping and less on skincare. My philosophy is simple: use whatever is best-evidenced by the literature to prevent acne and signs of photoaging. That means UV protection to prevent damage to the skin, and a synthetic retinoid to treat/prevent fine lines and acne. I previously used adapalene 0.1% (Differin) as my retinoid of choice, and it has been shown in the literature to achieve similar effects in acne reduction to tretinoin with fewer side-effects. However, tretinoin has a huge body of literature and FDA approval for treatment of fine wrinkles, so I recently switched to 0.02% tretinoin. 

Basics:

* **Skin Type**: Sensitive, Combo/Dry (25 y/o M)
* **Concerns**: My skin will turn red with the slightest offense, especially keeping myself clean-shaven to wear an N95. 
* **Goals**: Reduce redness, prevent fine lines/wrinkles, and protect against skin cancer

**AM Routine**: 

* LRP Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser: a great gentle, soap-free cleanser
* Clinique Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly: essentially like a hydrating serum which goes on clear and keeps my skin from peeling
* Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun: UV protection is essential to every skincare routine, preventing signs of aging and skin cancers before they happen

**PM Routine**: 

* LRP Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser: in the shower to save time
* Curology Formula - 0.02% Tretinoin, 4% Niacinamide, 5% Azelaic Acid: The only step with actives in my routine, I really only care about the retinoid (tretinoin) here. 
* Clinique Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly: only if I feel I need more moisture than that given by the Curology retinoid vehicle 

**Product reviews**:

* LRP Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser: this is an excellent cleanser with minimal extra ingredients. My main goal for a cleanser is that it serves as a gentle detergent to lift away sunscreen or moisturizer, and this works well for that purpose without frivolous ingredients. Plus, it comes in a huge bottle for like $15. 
* Curology (0.02% Tretinoin, 4% Niacinamide, 5% Azelaic Acid): Curology gives me an easy way to get tretinoin and access to a mid-level provider. The niacinamide and azelaic acid do not contribute significantly to my overall desire to use the product, but may contribute to some relief of acne and redness. The vehicle (i.e., the fluid in which the active ingredients are mixed) is fine enough and works as a moisturizer. 
* Clinique Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly: this is a very, very simple moisturizer. It has few ingredients which keeps my sensitive skin from turning red, and applies supremely easily almost like a serum. It's also available in a bulk size (6.7oz) for just $39. CeraVe moisturizer would also be excellent here, but I wanted a gel formulation for ease of application and lightness. 
* Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun: excellent, long-lasting UVA/UVB protection without extra ingredients is all that I desire in a sunscreen. Not leaving a white cast or shine on my face is a bonus. This fits the bill perfectly. I love seeing simple routines. As someone who has dry/combo sensitive rosacea skin, I find simple routines work best. I‚Äôm really against people using too many products especially non-evident based botanical ingredients. I also believe that staying consistent is key. Switching out products too often is very bad. What is your curology formula? Ugh curology. Overpriced and not great. But love the laroche wash This is not evidence based or anything. That‚Äôs what anyone with some research would use and it has nothing to do with being a medical student or anything since non of these are studied in medical school. How is this evidence based other than maybe the curology? eViDeNcE BaSED Lmao embarrassing No need to share that you are a medical student, this does not equate being a dermatologist and falsely elevates your skin care routine as being superior. Evidence based products can be chosen by anyone able to read peer reviewed journals. Btw I am a MD. Love this! Study hard. Take care ‚ù§ so cringe I‚Äôve been using Curology for years and I love it! Especially since I couldn‚Äôt see a derm otherwise and they‚Äôve been working with me to adapt my formula through all my life changes, such as hormonal birth control to pregnancy and beyond. Has anyone else noticed that LRP cleansers taste bad? Like, I‚Äôm not drinking my cleanser or anything but some inevitably gets in my mouth especially if I‚Äôm in a rush. I didn‚Äôt have this issue with CeraVe. obsessed with that LRP cleanser. its sooo good. p r e t e n t i o u s i use the same face wash and sunscreen! Great post. Very interesting to see that those in health care usually have a similar philosophy. Routines like this are a helpful reminder of how the market is dominated by expensive fluff animal testing :(( But is it evidence-based *best* practice? I LOOOVE clinique‚Äôs dramatically different line This stuff is probably still outside my price range but it's great to see a routine once in a while that has fewer than five products in it. I simply cannot relate to the people who post shelfies with roughly 10 bottles that are each $10/oz, like damn don't you people have rent and bills to pay?

Also, I'm curious what your process was to come up with the evidence for this routine? And any general insights you can provide or myths you care to dispel? Never store your sunscreen in direct sunlight Why no vitamin c?

edit: also, why not just prescription tretinoin? Came here to say that the LRP face wash is amazing! I bought it on a whim a few weeks ago and my skin has not been this unproblematic since I was 10 years old. 

(Kind of exaggerating but not really) Ooo how do you like the clinique jelly? I used the gel moisturizer for a while and really liked it How does the Centella sunscreen compare to other's you've used before? I heard it can make your face a little oily. I use the EltaMD UV clear one right now and was thinking of switching over just because I hear Korean sunscreens are just better at protecting against sun damage. Wow, the Clinique jelly used to be my holy grail and somehow I totally forgot about it. I need to go back to it!! I love simple routines! And that sunscreen is awesome Hi there. (23y.o M- Newbie) same skin as you. 
My routine Night/Day is the same. Micellar fluid then Thermal water and in the evening i add on Vitamin C. Do you think buying that gel from Clinique something usefull or not necessary? This is the type of Shelfie I like to see. I‚Äôve never believed skin routines should have 10 million steps. I have a moisturizer, a sunscreen, a cleanser for my face, a cleanser for my back (with active), and spot patches. 5 products, which I update depending if I find something better. I‚Äôve got the cleanser, would have ordered the purito sunscreen if it wasn‚Äôt out of stock at the time, and have used Curology in the past.

Someone gave me a random sample of the Clinique Jelly that I am now looking forward to trying because of your post :) [removed] Great cleanser, it saved my skin lol I love the simplicity I think you just changed my life How are you like the centella sunscreen? Any Canadians here who have been able to get a hold of the LRP cleanser? I couldn't find it anywhere, got my husband to grab it for me to try when he went to the States, but I'm almost out :(. Really liked it but can't seem to find it here. Omg we have the exact same products!! I'm using them everyday as well!! It'd be a surprise if I was a med student, but I'm not haha. What's your experience over Purito ??? Is that la roche-posay cleanser really sulfate-free? I thought they only have cleansers with sulfate. This is why every dermatologist in my country always said to me to never use la roche-posay cleansers M3 here. I have the same exact products except for the Clinique haha. 
LRP cleanser I like but it leaves my face feeling VERY clean and takes all oils off. Almost squeaky. So I use once daily. Think I prefer the hydrating gentle cleaner instead, makes me feel less stripped. Thought I would like the foaming cleanser better! Weird. Our skin sounds very similar. I think I‚Äôm going to try out some of your recommendations! Thanks for doing all that research for me. which centella sunscreen should i get? i‚Äôm conflicted I love this review! Has anyone here tried the La rochposay medicated face wash or the moisturizing one? I‚Äôve been legit trying to figure out which of the three to buy and I‚Äôm losing my mind ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Aww yeah I use that Clinique jelly too! That clinique moisturizer looks veeeeryyy enticing. What kind of skin do you have? [deleted] I love the Clinique jelly moisturiser. [deleted] Following Been looking for a new sunscreen! You sold me on this one i love it, short & sweet :-) Love the "evidence based" part :)

Why the downvotes? No ill  intent. I‚Äôm a nurse, that‚Äôs our language. I get ads for Curology ALL THE FREAKIN TIME... how is it any different from drug store face washes? My skin was never worse than it was during MS1 and MS2, finally got a doc I knew to write me for tretinoin leading up to step1 üòÇ It gets better. Enjoy M1 and the fact you actually don't have to worry about STEP 1 being graded. Just learn for the sake of learning and not for the grades. 

Also make time for a routine. It'll keep you fresh on the outside, and also make you feel a bit happier on the inside. Also, you're an M1, you should have at least 1 day/week to give yourself as a "personal day." Even if it's 12 hours, just make sure you give yourself some de-stress time.   


Good luck! 

\- PGY-1 Lol. Awwww. Hang in there. Fellow medical student here. I was stupid enough to do it in my 3rd language as a (slightly mature) student. I‚Äôm loving it though. I‚Äôm also using tret. It gets better!!!!! Just push through. You will be glad you did. It‚Äôs good for the skin Is it working? :P I‚Äôve tried it! It‚Äôs lightweight and gentle but I personally didn‚Äôt find it hydrating enough even with my oily skin :( I love it. I have extremely dry skin and I find it very hydrating and weightless on my skin. It‚Äôs not hydrating enough for me personally to use alone, but i haven‚Äôt found anything yet that is. (I layer 2-3 different moisturizers) I'm surprised to see someone like that cactus moisturizer. I got a mini and it pilled so awful with just about everything I was using and my sunscreens! I didn't even finish the mini, I just tossed it. It gave me SUCH bad acne! Visit the counter at a Dillard‚Äôs or Macy‚Äôs and they always have samples. The samples are what got me hooked. I have tried using Neutrogena‚Äôs Hydroboost gel as a cheaper alternative, but I think it just isn‚Äôt as good. My best friend loves it but I give it a hard pass. I tried to love it but it just left my skin dry and made dry patches even drier! I have combo skin that's pretty sensitive. If you‚Äôre concerned about price, Costco has jumbo 3.4 oz tubs of it for around $20 but I also hated the lotion. It broke me out and pilled an incredible amount. Hey fellow boscia cactus water lover...Costco often has it! A few months back I got a 100mL jar for ~$30 on Costco.com! I have oily skin and I love it. Too much moisturizing breaks me out :( I use it as my morning moisturiser and I use cerave at night. I have combo skin and I use adapalene and clinique is great and didn't break me out, it's lightweight. I started using the jelly recently in the morning and I really like it! I usually use something thicker at night though and will probably switch back to something thicker in the day for winter. I'm saving this post because I'm on here trying to learn what's the most basic routine I can get away with. Simple and effective is my jam! 

I had to change birth control because I was so bad at taking one small pill each day, I have zero chance at implementating a skincare routine of 10 different products XD boring but effective Also an MS4 (matching in Ob/Gyn this cycle)! I'm guessing everything but the moisturizer? Really, for dry skin and peeling you want a great emollient. Any moisturizer will do; I simply focused on something that was easy to spread, quick to absorb, (relatively) inexpensive, and free of irritants (essential oils, fragrances, strange extracts). That's generally why CeraVe and Cetaphil moisturizers are recommended as well - simple, cheap and effective.  If I have really bad areas of peeling/dryness, I use a thick layer of Aquaphor (Vaseline or any petrolatum-based product will also do). The unfortunate part of starting any synthetic retinoid is that you will have some significant irritation for 2-3 months. When I first started with adapalene (Differin) a couple years ago, my skin was dry, red and irritated for about 3 months. Make sure to use a strong moisturizer during this time. You can cover areas you don‚Äôt want to be treated with aquaphor/Vaseline/petrolatum before applying the retinoid to avoid chapping of the lips or eyelids. Consistency is key. A retinoid is a daily (or every other day) treatment, not a spot treatment, and should be used as prescribed by your provider. The irritation eventually subsidies, and you might have great results in the end. I‚Äôm 19 now and have been using retinoids on and off for the past five years. The most important thing I‚Äôve learned: consistency is key. So, you want to make a routine that will allow you to use your retinoid as much as possible, including the formulation of the retinoid itself! In other words, if you have sensitive skin (I do), it is 100% ok to start off with the smallest concentration available (0.01 for tretinoin, 0.025 is the dose most people start off with). Even at that level, it is effective, and you will most likely notice some dryness. But, it‚Äôs minimal enough that you should be able to use it 5-7/7 days a week which is key. This is much better than the alternative of starting with a higher dose but not sticking with a consistent regimen. Over time your skin will get acclimated to the tretinoin, and if you feel a higher dose would be beneficial, you can always increase it. I'm also curious about this and whether the jelly is a good match for oily skin. I‚Äôve tried Clinique‚Äôs dramatically different moisturizing lotion and Clinique‚Äôs moisture surge (‚Äúextended thirst relief‚Äù). I liked them both, they both did the job with no issues but I would say the moisture surge felt more hydrating and luxurious and is my favorite moisturizer I‚Äôve ever used. Unfortunately it seems like it‚Äôs discontinued, because I can‚Äôt find it on Clinique‚Äôs website. I still have my panned container :( 

Right now I‚Äôm using curology‚Äôs moisturizer and I can‚Äôt complain as my skin has been on the rise the past few months! I would just say it doesn‚Äôt feel as ‚Äúluxurious‚Äù or hydrating (my forehead sometimes looks slightly dry but doesn‚Äôt feel dry at all). I would also love to know how Clinique‚Äôs other moisturizers compare as well! The Dramatically Different Lotion and Gel aren't marketed as moisturizers, despite what they say on the bottle. They're moisture boosters, designed to be layered with moisturizer. They may work fine for some people on their own, but every Clinique training I've ever been to says they're supposed to be layered. I don't know about the jelly, though. By the time that came out, I no longer worked in department store cosmetics. I used to use so many different products before signing up out of desperation. I absolutely love it and my skin has never looked better.

I'm down to 3-5 products now. Mainly a wash, curology, and a moisturizer. Sometimes I'll oil cleanse before the wash, and I have a night oil that I use occasionally when I'm feeling extra dry. But I absolutely love how simple my routine is, now.

Hopefully you see similar results! FYI, that sunscreen's protection is ultimately questionable. Someone else posted a thread with UV photos of it and it seemed to rub off with very little effort. Having used it myself and gotten sunburned despite reapplication...yeah. Not a fan, even though I loved the idea of it originally. It just never absorbs. >a synthetic retinoid

am i missing something here? i was under the impression all retinoids were synthetic Good routine but with a dry/combo skin I would choose La Roche Posay hydrating (in EU called caring) cleanser instead. Or an equivalent from SVR/Bioderma/Avene who all have this type of cleansers Found the derm gunner, jk. Thanks for this, been thinking a lot about getting a routine together, but you know clerkships, nbmes, other excuses. Tho this is exactly what I needed to start. Hope this helps hairy guys too lol [deleted] Thank you for this! I'm currently using the LRP cleanser and I love it. I have really oily skin so I was curious if the sunscreen left you feeling sticky at all? Are you able to provide your sources? I‚Äôm interested in reading them! > UV protection is essential to every skincare routine, preventing signs of aging and skin cancers before they happen

some *mwah* chefs kiss, al dente mansplaining right here in SKINCAREADDICTION Since you mentioned having to keep clean-shaven to wear an N95 mask, I was wondering if you could go into slightly more detail on how your shaving routine plays into this. Yes this sub tempts people to buy every the ordinary product and pile it on but ya just need basic cleanse moisturize and spf really!! I worked with my prescribing PA to start with 0.02% Tretinoin, 4% Niacinamide, 5% Azelaic Acid. My plan is to gradually increase the dose percentage of tretinoin to 0.05 or 0.1%. It's important to note though that 0.025% may be just as effective as 0.1% [in this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7544967/). I agree it‚Äôs pricey but I really like that they combine the actives I use into one so I don‚Äôt have to use multiple serums and worry about layering etc. I get the Niacinamide, Azelaic acid, Tranexamic acid. I do think it‚Äôs overpriced but omg- it‚Äôs the only thing in over 3 years that has done anything to help my skin and I‚Äôve only been using it since May. I REALLLY hope to go off of it at some point but as someone who has a very long, expensive and ineffective routine, I‚Äôm grateful that it‚Äôs now only 3-4 steps long. Agree with the expensive part but honestly it was the only thing that did anything for my acne when I used it a couple years ago and my skin has been in a much better state since!  I can only imagine how much more money I would've spent trying to find the product that was going to work for me lol Is it really that overpriced? I guess it depends on your health insurance. If you have a high deductible plan you're looking at around $100-200 for a Dermatologist consultation and probably another $75 for tretinoin/clindamycin. You don't have to be a doctor to use evidence-based products. And he doesn't mean that he's doing the experiments himself or anything. It just means using things that have a lot studies backing up their effectiveness, and not taking chances on ingredients that are new to the scene or have limited evidence of effectiveness. Wouldn‚Äôt research involve studying evidence? Totally speculating here, but I‚Äôm guessing that OP‚Äôs use of ‚Äúevidence based‚Äù is referring more so to what is *not* in the routine versus what is in it. OP‚Äôs concern is anti-aging, so they choose to focus just on Tret and sunscreen, which have the most research backing their efficacy. They chose not to use other hyped but less research-backed ingredients like collagen or copper peptides or whatever.

Edit: OP also details in the comments why they chose to not include Vit C, as they don‚Äôt feel evidence is conclusive of its benefits.

(These aren‚Äôt my personal opinions on ingredients necessarily, just explaining how I interpreted OP‚Äôs statement.) The sunscreen, and then the act of gentle cleansing and moisturizing. Seriously! What evidence? Where are his peer reviewed journals and medical studies? I read ‚Äúevidence‚Äù 50 times but didn‚Äôt see one source lol Y'all are so salty lmao OP being in the medical field probably knows the efficacy of the ingredients in the products and is using ingredients that are science backed. I don‚Äôt understand? No need to share that you are an MD, lol.

I actually took it that OP was talking more about the fact that they are a busy student and wanted to find an efficient routine with proven products, rather than that they are claiming any medical expertise. [deleted] .... yes...? Not OP, but another Curology user. Curology is "technically" prescription. You have a lower-level provider (like a NP or PA) who is working under a supervising MD who authorizes the Rx. The nice thing is you can send them pics and ask questions when needed and they'll help you out. For Vitamin C (and other topical, non-synthetic vitamins), I‚Äôm not convinced that there is much benefit. There haven‚Äôt been many large, blinded clinical trials to support its use. [Here is a good (albeit older) review article](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05540.x). 

Exactly like u/fuckyeahballpythons mentioned, Curology is a prescription product. Tretinoin is not available without a prescription in the USA. You can get adapalene (a 3rd generation synthetic retinoid) over-the-counter as Differin gel. In parts of Europe, the opposite is true. Get ready to have it for the long haul. I bought it two years ago and literally just ran out the other day. It's the best face cleanser and best bang for your buck. Personally, this sunscreen has given me the most matte and natural finish, much more than others. I have oily, combo skin Hi there,

I use the Effaclar foaming face wash (not the medicated one) and love it but I guess some people might find it a little drying. The comfy water block is the mineral version. [deleted] It‚Äôs not face wash. Curology is an online company where you can submit details about your skin and your biggest concerns. Then a certified dermatologist or medical professional will make a custom formula for you to cater to your specific needs. Many people will use curology to get prescription strength retinol because it can be a lengthy and expensive process to see a dermatologist in person. I'm a PGY-1. Waiting to get a derm appointment for tret but adapalene is working pretty well for me right now. woop #BackToPreRounding Thank you!! I haven‚Äôt found my groove yet with the workload, I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll feel differently in a month. But I always appreciate hearing from those who made it out! I second this.  It honestly felt like a glorified hyaluronic acid serum to me.  I found I was better off using the HA+B5 serum from The Ordinary mixed with the Cerave Lotion I'm trying to find me a moisturizer that's affordable for my oily skin. I looove bosica but it is almost $40 for barely a 1oz. It seems really hard to find an affordable jell moisturizer. Ok idk why I never though to later moisturizers! Great tip! Which ones do you layer? I have a Nivea one but it‚Äôs too thin imo Have you tried Belif aqua bomb? That‚Äôs the only one heavy enough for me Yeah I literally came to the comments for more info on this... OP said dry skin but a jelly does not seem rich enough (at least it wouldn‚Äôt be for me, ESPECIALLY while using tret). 

Also, just as an aside - tatcha water cream did literally nothing for me, but the belif peat moisturizer or whatever was LIFE. I decided to mix it up and got ceramidin this time, so trying to use it up before I go back to to the belif one, lol. Highly recommend! Try Tula‚Äôs face cream. Really good. What cleanser do you use? I used to have this issue but found that switching to an oil cleanser helped out quite a bit. Thank you. I actually returned the cactus moisturizer for exactly that reason. I liked it at first, but after a couple days, it was too much effort to keep it from pilling. That is the only skincare product I've ever returned. Interesting! I have very dry skin and it works so well for me. My skin just drinks it up...like a cactus lol. That's weird. I've never experienced peeling at all. It has helped my oily skin so much. Sorry to hear :( Thanks!! If you‚Äôre talking about the boscia, they sometimes get larger sizes too! I got a 100 mL a few months back for ~$30. (If not, then ignore me!) I hear a couple of people said their skin was peeling with it too but I've never had that issue. It's the only moisturizer that doesn't make my skin go crazy oily as soon as I put it on. I actually bought the jumbo size from Costco website but they don't sell it anymore. I see it on eBay but I'm not going to trust that sadly. I actually got it from the Costco website. But they don't sell the jumbo anymore on their website :/ sadly Cool! I agree too much moisturizer will make my skin also super oily. I used to use CeraVe but it would just make my skin so badly oil up. Oh good to hear! I actually use liquid gold at night. I used to use CeraVe but it made my skin more oily. I think I'll definitely try Clinique since a lot of people seem to like it. I know it seems like a pretty simple moisturizer but maybe that's what I need. Oh good! I use liquid gold at night but I'm feeling like it's too light weight for nighttime use. I'm thinking of maybe switching it to the daytime but then that means I need to find a moisturizer for night haha Sounds good! I am not quite as minimalist as OP (partly because Curology is not available where I live) but I am down to six products, with no more than three steps each time and my skin is so much better than it was when I had a crazy load of products and different steps. 

Essentials for me: face wash, sunscreen, moisturiser, adapalene. Snail mucin and an eye cream are the extra two and I could ditch them if you told me I could only have four products but I will keep using them for now üòÇ There are plenty of things that I want to be inherently interesting - people, art, food - but I am happy for skincare to be boring and effective! I would rather have a 4 step routine and a fat wallet than 10 steps no money and skkin that is breaking out. Not everyone wants or can have 10+ step routine loaded with fragrance & thousands of ingredients. Less is sometimes more. I don't understand why you got so many downvotes - boring but effective sounds perfect and it doesn't seem like you said it to he an a hole ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Good you to you and u/pharyngo! MS3 getting ready to get wrecked my IM clerkship! I'm also an MD, and my products are also gentle cleanser, sunscreen, moisturizer and retinoid. Keeping it simple and evidence-based. Did you have any problem transitioning from Differin into Tetrinoin? You say the retinoid is a daily or every other day treatment. Have you read anything or have any good resources to share about the efficacy of every day vs every other day application?

I'm currently at every other day with my 0.04 retin a micro and don't really want to do every day if the only effect will be more irritation and no significant benefit. What are your thoughts? I'm very oily and I definitely prefer the gel to the jelly. I found I had to use 2-3 LAYERS of the jelly to get adequate hydration (otherwise my face just felt like it was missing something), AND it broke me out lol - on top of making my eyes sting after a few months of use! Just three pumps of the gel, though, and I'm plenty moisturized without being greasy. I don't think it's even remotely close to being moisturizing enough for the most oily of skins. It's basically a slightly hydrating serum. If you want a gel moisturizer, Hada Labo Perfect Gel is FAR SUPERIOR. It's actually SUPER moisturizing. More moisturizing than half of my emollient creams. When you say moisture surge, do you mean [this one](https://www.clinique.ca/product/1687/50933/skin-care/moisturizers/moisture-surge-72-hour-auto-replenishing-hydrator)? I've seen it locally in stores but haven't tried it yet. My go-to gel moisturizer the past year or so has been the fragrance-free hydro boost (Neutrogena). Tbh that kinda sounds like something a company would say in order to sell more product since selling two things together is more profitable than selling one. lol Same experience for me. I got burnt when using this sunscreen, even though I reapplied it multiple times. Meanwhile my family members who used standard American sunscreen and didn‚Äôt bother with reapplication didn‚Äôt get burned. I just ordered it :( is there a better AB sunscreen you‚Äôd recommend? It worked fine for me in the winter but I'm definitely getting tanned from it now during the sunnier months. Can you post the link? I‚Äôm very interested as I JUST bought this an am waiting for it to arrive so the thing I‚Äôve discovered with that sunscreen is that it‚Äôs not suitable at all if you‚Äôre going to be outside. you‚Äôll need a water resistant sunscreen! purito sunscreens seem to be better for indoor use Do you have the link to the post on the protection of that sunscreen? All I read are good things about it in this sub. I had the same thing happen! I sent my purrito back and instead have been liking the sunprise spf 50. I‚Äôve only used it a few times. But it seemed more promising That's disappointing, but thank you for the heads up. I've been using it while trying to find a new sunscreen that I like. You must have oily skin, I assume? Folks with dry skin generally review the Purito quite highly and say that it absorbs/dries down quickly. 

FWIW, I use the Purito unscented as my everyday sunscreen because I only go outside for a half hour at most in my heavily wooded (therefore shady) backyard. 

When I'm actually doing things outside and staying out for any longer, I use Bioderma Photoderm Max Milk, which has a PPD rating of 46. This is the EU version of course. That way I have zero doubt about the protection I'm getting. >La Roche

yep the La Roche Posay hydrating cleanser is great i use it on the regular Good luck with Curology. I‚Äôve been doing it since May and had low hopes. Nothing ever works on my skin and it‚Äôs done great work thus far. Going on spiro as well to complement it and am so excited to see how they both work together Yeah, I have dry skin and worked my way up to a higher concentration of tret. My skin absolutely COULD NOT acclimate to it so I went back down to .025, since it‚Äôs effective and non-irritating for me. My skin looks and feels amazing with the low dose. You pay for expertise at a dermatologist, which I get if you don't have coverage for office visits can be expensive. Prescriptions usually aren't that much where I am in USA. Most people w curology have clindamycin in their mix, I have never seen it mixed with benzoyl peroxide or anything else to prevent bacterial resistance which can happen in a few days. Lol... You can literally Google mountains of evidence that tretinoin and sunscreen work. Honestly, it's shocking that you didn't know that and expected OP to provide evidence that sunscreen and tretinoin work. You pretty much don‚Äòt learn anything about ingredients while in medical school :) that‚Äòs not our focus, you only learn it when you‚Äòre going into dermatology. The medical field is a vast vast space, and I'm guessing OP is still doing her clinical placements with each speciality (of which dermatology is not a huge part). 

Good on her for looking for evidence-based skincare, but this routine is probably what most subscribers to this sub could come up with after reading research abstracts/ the sidebar too. Evidence-based skincare for all, yay! Probably bc the post title is pretentious and OP is being called out The title. Their status as a medical student provides no substance to their post, and their mentioning of it makes the entire thing sound pretentious i deal with chemical for living as a biochemist. i don‚Äôt feel the need to tell someone this info just to validate myself lol. you don‚Äôt need to be in the medical field to know how the ingredients in these products work. just do your research! don‚Äôt limit urself! That sounds pretty cool, I'll have to look it up. Do they accept health insurance? I have a prescription of tret from my pcp but would prefer to work with a derm, but don't want to go in person during the pandemic > For Vitamin C (and other topical, non-synthetic vitamins), I‚Äôm not convinced that there is much benefit. There haven‚Äôt been many large, blinded clinical trials to support its use. Here is a good (albeit older) review article. 

That's a point that most derms take as well, which is counterproductive as far as ascorbic acid is concerned. The science is undecided, but there is almost unanimity in the community that *it does* work. I just use their Lipikar AP+ Balm as a moisturizer day and night, and just use plain water right now for my face. The moisturizer is great but very heavy/greasy, so I‚Äôm curious about their other products as a whole. Legit their balm is the first moisturizer that has never broken me out, which is insane because I have tried like 10+. Thanks for telling me this!! I was about to purchase it on amazon but was hesitant because of the reviews. Do you have a sunscreen that you would recommend that doesn‚Äôt have chemicals but also protects broad spectrum? Thank you for explaining what it is Only an MS3, but I heard a rumor that it‚Äôs chill to prescribe yourself retinoids?? Can you confirm or deny it? 

Not going to lie, it‚Äôs one of the things getting me through my rough first clerkship! Try asking your primary care doctor, there's no reason they can't treat basic acne and the wait is way shorter than for a derm. I basically televisted my PCP, said "hey I have adult acne, can we try tret plz" and that was that. Something that helps me is the pomodoro timer. Take a long break after 2-3 hours of solid work. Set a task list for yourself every day. Meditate, exercise, eat right, laugh, have fun & really try to understand what you're learning. I struggled a lot my first term so I can honestly sympathize. It will all come together. Just believe in yourself and back away when it gets overwhelming. I also second a weekly personal day. Good luck <3 No problem! You will survive my friend. Keep strong and if you need any advice feel free to reach out at any time! Good luck! I think the Clinique gel is nice for hot humid weather, especially layered with a moisturizing toner and serum plus sunscreen, but it's definitely NOT sufficient for dry or cold weather. I bet it works great for oily skinned folks but my dry skin needs way more. My sister found Bosica at Costco! Way bigger portion and better pricing. This was in Oregon, USA. I just started using Zeroid cream with urea, doesn't feel like a cream, more like a gel/serum to me, absorbs very very well and quickly. About $17 for 2 oz I think. 1 - Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Water Gel Face Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Serum

2- Skin Plumping Gel Cream by Hada Labo

These are two that I‚Äôve tried and like. Thanks to Dr. Dray on YT. Nature Republic makes a pretty nice gel cream, light but very moisturizing. It's called aqua something or other, i don't recall exactly, and it comes in 3 versions for different skin types. You can find it fairly cheap on Amazon. I've only tried the pink one because my skin gets crazy dry but I've read a lot of good reviews for the others. I think there's added fragrance though. Currently I am using hada labo premium, followed by tatcha the water cream, then if I am extra dry I will add Clinique moisture surge intense. But usually just the first two followed my sunscreen, or at night time I finish with vaniply ointment. Lots of trial and error, finally found some products that are working really well to keep my skin hydrated. I sometimes layer moisturizers in the winter, and I have read that anything with HA should be put under a cream moisturizer. It might be beneficial to look up which ingredients are recommended under/over for best penetration into the skin. I like that and I like Glow Recipie's Banana Cream Nope! I‚Äôll make a note if I get a hankering to try some other products when I run out of what I‚Äôve got YOO I was obsessed with the aqua bomb until I tried the peat revival one in the green tub. It‚Äôs somehow even better. Wouldn't that depend on whether your skin is actually dry or just dehydrated? I use tret, and my peeling only stopped when I started using toners. Heavy creams don't make a difference. I use stratia velvet cleansing milk. I have repurchased it multiple times and I love it. What oil cleansers do you like? I typically only oil cleanse if I have a full face of makeup on because it removes everything better than the velvet cleansing milk I agree I have oily skin and my skin loves it. Not peeling, Pilling. When I'd add other things on top of it(sunscreen/foundation/etc) it or touch my face, it would start to roll/ball up. I know, boo. But they tend to cycle stuff, so I bet it will come back! That's one of the reasons I like it. It's a neutral moisturiser so I can add aha/bha or use retinoids and it not be affected by the moisturiser. I have a 'simple' face wash, a No7 moisturiser (I don't know what's in it but I get them as gifts) and a la Roche Posay suncream. I really need something for the scars I get from every single spot. I reached 20 and suddenly any tiny bit of damage will stay red for 6 months or more! I don't get it either. I'm rereading that very short statement and it sounds exactly like what OP and this sub in general stands for. Boring aka simple, and effective. It's got -163 right now. Wishing you the best of luck! Third year is grueling but transformative. Also an MD and yeah, same thing hehehe What retinoid do you use? I've been wanting to look into starting to use retinoids but haven't really understood where to start I didn‚Äôt notice any, no. In theory, adapalene is a more selective agent (i.e., it has higher affinity for RAR-b) than tretinoin, so I expected to see some changes when switching. Your experience may vary, and certainly depends on the concentration of each. 0.04 retin a micro - been there, done that! SO drying. Ugh, I cringe at the memories of my face burning no matter what I put on to try and soothe it. Try switching over to the lowest dose tretinoin (0.01, and cream not gel) so you are able to use it more often. You should see the same beneficial effects with much less dryness. I agree. I used the gel for a while and it was pretty basic but when I tried the jelly on my hand at the mall it absorbed so fast and didn‚Äôt hydrate at all. Thank you! I am ridiculously oily throughout the day. At least now I just have to look "presentable" on web cam so I have been wearing less makeup. I just want to tone that natural "dewiness" down. No, mine had the subname ‚Äúextended thirst relief‚Äù this one says ‚Äú72 hour auto replenishing hydrator‚Äù, so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just under a different name or it‚Äôs a completely different formula. 

How is the neutrogena one? I‚Äôve been seeing that moisturizer on this sub a lot, and I love its price, especially compared to Clinique! If you don‚Äôt mind, what‚Äôs your skin type? I have dry skin. I've thought the same thing and discussed it with others. Just like anything else, YMMV, but I think it's important to know their marketing of the product. I was using the biore sunscreen and it was working well. I swapped to this one and I've been seeing spots appearing again too. :/ Not AB, but European La Roche Posay Ultra Light Invisible Fluid SPF50+ has a texture of typical AB sunscreen, dries quickly to natural to dewy finish, it‚Äôs not sticky and has PPD 46. I was using Biore religiously because I refused to believe something better would be available on European market but here I am! It‚Äôs little bit pricier than Biore, but worth it, especially if you manage to get a good deal. I love Anessa. No white cast, no stickiness. Refused to use sunscreen before I found this, and have been sticking to it for 8 years now. Idk what your requirements are, but I love Nivea Super Sun Protect Water Gel SPF 50 PA+++ for having all the protection and cosmetic elegance of more expensive Japanese sunscreens at a very good price per ounce. I have personally yet to find something better than the MISSHA All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+ PA+++. No white cast, doesn't leave your face greasy, I've used it even on hikes in the mountains (applying once in the morning and then twice more during the day) and it protected me really well. I get freckles from sun exposure, so that's the first sign of how well a sunscreen protects me before burning and I got minimal freckles with this one.

I've recently bought La Roche Posay Invisible Fluid SPF50+ (not AB, I know) that someone also recommended below because I cannot always find the Missha one and it's alright but a bit more greasy and I need more product to protect me. There‚Äôs a lot to choose from. Do a sub search and you‚Äôll likely find an affordable one. Not OP, but I found a similar link. I also just ordered it and am waiting for it to arrive, so it‚Äôs too late now.

EDIT: I actually found a more anecdotal review that was super helpful along with helpful comments. 


https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gklg62/review_purito_green_level_unscented_sun_spf_50_pa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf That's weird because countless people have reported burning, tanning and worsening of pigmentation while using it. Here's one example:

EDIT: And [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/hezibi/sun_care_under_uv_camera_purito_centella_green/)'s the sunscreenr post. Noob lurker here, how exactly does this stuff work? Is it a different formula for everyone? OP‚Äôs mix really piqued my interest since I‚Äôve been contemplating adding one of niacinimide or AA into my routine. Goodrx has tretinoin at around $60 and clindamycin $15 which is what I was going off. 

I know the clindamycin resistance can be an issue but I've never heard of it happening in a few days. I just started a trial with them and was planning to do a benzoyl peroxide wash like once a week. Why am I being downvoted? Am I not catching the fact that this was humor? I‚Äôm pretty sure a 9 year old knows that sunscreen, cleansing and moisturizer is good for the skin. I think its more so the fact that OP choosing to describe their routine as "evidence-based" implies that other routines or ingredients are not, or at least that their routine is more supported by evidence than others. If that's the claim than the burden is on OP to provide the evidence. Otherwise why don't we all just start describing our routines as evidence-based to make them sound more sciency. Sorry, but this sub is ALREADY heavily evidence based. If OP‚Äôs title was ‚ÄúThe Busy McDonalds Worker‚Äôs Evidence-Based Routine‚Äù posted with the lengthy comment without one source, people would be critical. If you think google is a good enough resource then nearly every routine posted on here could be considered evidence-based. If you want your routine to be lauded based on its ‚Äúevidence‚Äù then post your fucking sources! Right? It's ScA, OP reasonably assumed the audience here has done the literal bare minimum of research into effective ingredients. Pretty sure OP is a guy I see it as the title contextualizing how even as little as 15-30 minutes saved are critical in a med student's life. They‚Äôre just saying that this is a simple skincare routine because they are busy, plus it works for them. You don‚Äôt need 10+ steps especially if you‚Äôre a busy person/student. There simply sharing their routine. Plus other people here are relating to it and starting a convo, which is a good thing! No need to comment negativity. They don't accept insurance, but often times the $25/mo treatment is cheaper or the same as the copays for doctor visits and prescriptions probably. I went to a derm because it's way cheaper to do so on medicaid vs going with Curology again, and it might be harder to get 0.05% (what I was prescribed from the derm) with Curology (my formula had a measly 0.009% tret). I'd just stick to your prescription tret tbh. I'm not sure if they do. I have insurance but haven't had luck finding the right derm. I use a healthcare spending account (USA) for this, so at least it's being paid for with pre-tax funds. [deleted] Still feel sketch about it. Might ask a colleague but wouldn‚Äôt prescribe myself. Feels a bit better to go the old school way. Worked in state regulation for healthcare licensees it is never a okay to self prescribe anything. I also have psoriasis which I manage on a biologic with my dermatologist, so I figured mind as well address it while I'm there. In the meantime adapalene works really well for me. I just want to up the strength a bit down the road. I've never heard of either one of these but I'm definitely going to Google them. Thanks! I'll check it out! Thank you! Hada labo premium is such a good product and at such a great price! Hyaluronic acid is not an expensive ingredient but the prices I see on these little bottles of HA serums are ridiculous. +1 on layering serums and skincare. The Asian skincare sub taught me all about that Have you tried cerave from a tube? It‚Äôs so thick and creamy, I love it. Ah, I haven‚Äôt tried that. How would compare them? I use toner too, but the moisturizer I use still makes a gigantic difference. Things like tatcha water cream and the jelly moisturizer in the OP aren‚Äôt enough for me personally. If I use one of those with tret my skin turns into a cracked, peeling, flaky mess after a few days. 

The belif one is medium density Id say, and absorbs pretty well after a min or two. People obvs have different skin - but heftier moisturizers 100% make a difference for me. Honestly, I go for straight up cleansing oil like Badger's. It leaves my otherwise crusty desert skin soft and balanced. Now that I am thinking of it though, I suppose it was misleading to say I only use one moisturizer now, as I almost always use a moisturizing toner like Klair's supple preparation toner, which also helps! Its just gotten me from the point of 'I NEED' specific types of moisturizers and blends on top, to using whatever kind of moisturizer I have available to me. That plus a chemical exfoliation every now and then. It seems like a lot to list but it is SO MUCH more simple than my old routine. I hope. Because I love it! That‚Äôs where the retinoid could help you. Restating the comment they replied to and applying a generally negative connotation to it is why people are downvoting them. Saying it's boring is going to make people assume they think the routine could be improved by making it more "interesting", i.e. more complicated. It just reads as a bit pretentious, even if they didn't mean it that way. It took me a few tries to start a retinoid. I have dry/sensitive skin and have had perioral dermatitis in the past. I would always quit because of dryness and flaking, even if I only used it once a week. But I eventually had success with The Oridnary's retinol in squalane, starting with the lowest percentage about once a week. Now I use 0.5% every 2-3 days, and I'm introducing a prescription retinol. It took months until I saw real changes in my skin, but I'm happy with how it looks now. It's important to use it at night and to wear a sunscreen in the day. I actually don't have any drying! Well not much. A few flakes every so often - thank you Cerave and Vaseline. I just don't want to have to apply it more than it's needed. Yeah, thats why I was confused about the Clinique one.I'm not sure if it was just re-branded or if its an entirely different product. You'd probably have to look at the ingredients list to compare if they're the same or not.

I have combo-oily skin and the hydro boost is pretty great. Normally I wouldn't recommend it for super dry skin types but if you like other gel moisturizers, maybe it would work for you? It can be pricey for a drug store moisturizer ($24.99 where I live) but it is often on sale for $16-18. I seen some opinions that many of the trendy sunscreens coming from Asia they are meant for office wear, so to protect your skin as you walk from your parking or transit stop to your office. They are not meant for serious sun protection. This is a part of how they are able to be so light.

I‚Äôve been stuck on the Ceravae AM cream, at first I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan and I still don‚Äôt like how thick it goes on and how if you overwork it as you‚Äôre applying it it pills up...but my skin seems to like it and has been clearer since I used it and I have found it does do a good job at sun protection. I want to try it but it's so expensive compared to most AB sunscreen options... Is it really that much better than Biore or Purrito? Seconding this one! I really like the light texture, which is more moisturizing than a Biore milk, and less heavy than the essence-type sunscreens. It absorbs quickly on me, and even comes in a pump bottle! I love the Missha sun milk sunscreens. Wore them to south beach Miami last November, literally spent all weekend on the beach, reapplied every few hours and no burn at all. It was great. Thank you! At this point there should be a moratorium against Purito unscented. Thanks so much!!! So if all depends on your formula and what exactly you need it for. I have/had bad acne and scarring. After taking the quiz and uploading photos of my face, I was prescribed 1% Cindamycin, 0.04% Tretinoin and 7% Azalaic acid. The first bottle is $5 and then $50-something (? someone correct me if I'm wrong) every 2 months after that. Within the first month I started to see the texture of my skin change. I purged up until about a a week or 2 ago and this week is the first week where I don‚Äôt feel a single pimple or purging milia (those small bumps that just sit under your skin but aren‚Äôt quite pimples). I‚Äôd say give it a try since the first bottle is only $5. I believe if you want something specific you can put it in the notes when you do the quiz and that can be taken into account. I knew I wanted tretinoin and made sure I mentioned as much.

It is ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù some would say but money is no object to me when it comes to my face since I get stressed out when it‚Äôs not looking it‚Äôs best. I plan to keep using Curology but asking for a higher tret concentration. I will also go on spironolactone starting on Monday and am excited to see how that works. Eh, most people do the ‚Äúnever wear moisturizer or sunscreen because my skin is oily and sun is good for acne‚Äù well into adulthood I still know a lot of people well into their adult years that don't wear sun screen daily and use St. Ives type stuff religiously. You gotta put /s most of the people on here can‚Äôt really see sarcasm. This is completely ridiculous lol. His routine being evidence based is not a personal attack on yours. Just... Wtf? I don't know how people go through life functioning like this lol Lol what? The VAST majority of routines here are NOT "evidence based." Very very few people here are hunting around on Pubmed to find studies proving the efficacy of ingredients. Excuuuuuse me but I need EmPiRiCaL EviDeNcE that sunscreen is good for ur skin üò§üò§üò§üò§ Okay, then replace "her" with "him". My thoughts remains the same. ‚Äúmed student evidence based‚Äù... no need to be post pretentiously. Thank you! I have medium tan skin. I have been using the seshedio sunscreen and then now I‚Äôm using skinscueticals broad spectrum sunscreen. There‚Äôs one called skinsuit that I like a lot, which is reef safe and protects from blue light, but it‚Äôs so expensive! While in most situations self prescribing is generally frowned upon, the AMA is fine with physicians self prescribing for short term or minor problems.

*edit: also the specific restrictions vary from state to state! No probs! It's just the Zeroid cream with urea in it. It's supposed to help with rebuilding skin barrier, I think it has that ratio of ceramides, etc.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/csfm1l/guide\_ceramides\_in\_skin\_care\_a\_scam\_ceramide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/csfm1l/guide_ceramides_in_skin_care_a_scam_ceramide/) Yeah I saw a comment once where someone mentioned that hada labo premium was a game changer for them in battling dry tretinoin skin, so I decided to try it. Definitely was a game changer! My skin has never been so plump and smooth. I normally suffer from flakes and bad texture. I have not! Only cerave I have tried was the hydrating cleanser and it made me break out badly. I know a lot of people report the same with that particular cleanser but it has me turned off from cerave for the time being. Especially since my current products are working so well! Both of them have fragrance, so if you don't like that, stay away. I like the fragrance of Belif better. Also neither are cheap. I have dry, acne-prone skin and they both moisturize very well. They also don't leave a noticable film which I HATE with moisturizers.

Overall, I'd say they're pretty similar, very lightweight cream. I might like the results of the Banana Cream better but I think it's a bit more expensive per ounce. Less waste in the packaging tho as it's glass and maybe you might be able to recycle depending upon your area. Have you tried the Tatcha dewy skin cream? It's richer than the water cream. I have very dry sensitive skin and it works well for me. Oki doki I'll look into it! Ooh I think someone said retinol is the natural thing but harsh and retinoid is synthetic and more gentle? Is it the one that looks like blood?

My knowledge is so sparse XD Oh, I see. I didn't read it like that, since I refer to some of my own things as "boring," and I didn't think of it as negative, just like another word for simple, in my mind. It makes more sense when you put it that way. Do you use it on your bare skin or on top of moisturizer? Ahh gotcha. I am also curious as to how using retinoids every other day vs every single day compares. Are you using retin a for acne, fine lines/wrinkles or both? I personally wasn't doing anything different in my routine(basically walking the dog is what I do) between the two so I'm not sure how true that is for the biore one, it worked a lot better for me. The lightness with the biore though I thought came from the alcohol, which is why it's not as popular here. 

&#x200B;

My go to american sunscreen in the Aussie tinted, I've panned 3 of those. I like that I don't need to wear extra makeup either, it does enough smoothing/evening for me. I don't really like the combined moisturizer/sunscreen, I feel like I'm not going to be using enough to get the full benefits of the sunscreen. I‚Äôve never tried purito, but judging by the comments on this thread I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be trying it. Unpopular opinion but I‚Äôm not a fan of biore (I really wanted to like it) because I live in very hot and humid climate, and it never completely dries down and therefore leaves me shiny or sticky. 

Anessa dries down to a smooth satiny finish which I‚Äôm so grateful for in the climate I live in. I think there‚Äôs silicon to give that effect, so if you‚Äôre sensitive you might want to patch test. I haven‚Äôt experienced issues with clogged pores and god knows I‚Äôve got the most assholic skin type. lmaooo I almost have like a personal grudge against it now, and I've never even used it  üòÇüòÇüòÇ Thank you for the breakdown! I think I may have to bite the bullet and give it a try. And good luck on the spironolactone! I never said it was a personal attack on mine. I'll be the first to admit I didn't do some deep lit search to come up with my routine, I just read the sidebar. You won't see me posting an "evidence-based shelfie" anytime soon lmao What‚Äôs so scientifically excellent about this routine? Sunscreen and curology? I‚Äôd say nearly 85% of routines on here include sunscreen, and a great deal also include tret/a retinoid. Not only that but the sunscreen they‚Äôre using is one of the most ineffective ones available on the market. Who‚Äôs to say that OP got his evidence from Pubmed and not google? That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre asking for his sources. You‚Äôre literally proving my argument. The AMA is a professional association not a regulatory body.  If you're asking for guidance for what is and isn't okay to self-prescribe I would always look toward your malpractice carrier (they won't tell you to do something they can't defend) and the state laws and the regulatory body that enforces those laws. PharmD here. While not illegal, it is always an ethical discussion. But if it's just tretinoin? Meh, give me one too. Oh thank you! Are you talking about the hyaluronic hydrating toner? I want to try it too Yeah I broke out with the cleanser, but the cream is so rich which I love. I did! I liked it more than the water cream, but it still wasn‚Äôt quite it for me. Maybe I should give it another shot though. None of it looks like blood! Lol

Go to the wiki at r/tretinoin to learn more about the difference between retinol and different types of retinoids. Tretinoin is one type of retinoid. Me too. I wonder if a few people projected their own feelings, skin can be a really personal and emotional thing! Bare skin for the one in squalane, but the prescription one I'm applying on top of moisturizer. Yeah right? Of course the company's going to tell you to use it everyday so that you'll buy more. Both for me: acne and fine lines. Which biore sunscreen? purito isn't sweat or sebum proof, it's more of an indoors sunscreen. definitely not a hot and humid climate sunscreen It clearly reminds me of this professor saying that sunscreen use cause cancer, because people we go out under the sun thinking they're protected. It's basically the case with this one, it protects against jack shit, and people will think they're protected when a SPF 30 moisturizer probably does a better job. There, I said it. Probably because your shelfie wasn't evidence based? I use the Hada labo gokujyun premium hyaluronic acid lotion. It has different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid, a form of urea that is hydrating and also encourages exfoliation in a non irritating way. It's a really good formulation and an amazing value. Okay, I sound like an advertisement lol. I just really love it. A tip I learned was to pat it onto slightly damp skin - it enhances the hydrating effects.

It does leave your skin slightly tacky/sticky from the humectants, but it's designed to go under your moisturizer which takes care of that sensation. Can you share your routine for TO retinol ? Most likely the watery essence one from Japan. Yes. That's literally the point. OP could have easily come up with their routine by just browsing this sub, for all we know. The perfect milk is also popular and apparent has better protection so was wondering. Okay, and you could just as easily have found your skincare routine from beauty blogs and not this subreddit but I don't see you going around criticising people for saying "thanks for the skincare routine SCA!!!" Either way neither sunscreens are really made for extended exposure outside. People forget Japanese women etc walk around with umbrellas and parasols in the summer etc. Love that you kept it simple but super organized. Also love the plants, really livens up the shelf! **KUUKAUSITTAIN!** My newly revised skincare shelf!

I've gone with a really simple skincare routine my whole life but decided to dig deeper into skincare a bit before Christmas and ordered new things and changed my whole routine. I hope I educated myself enough to not make any horrible mistakes heh. Feel free to comment on my routine especially if it's missing something that would help with my skin concerns, I'm still so new to all of this!

**My skin type** is fairly normal, never really had any breakouts and it isn't sensitive at all to new products for example which is why I was condifent enough to just fully start a new routine. Tends to get a bit surface dry during the winter but that's about it.

**My main concern** is the blackheads/sebaceous filaments (big pores) on my nose, so I'm trying to target those for now. I've tried to treat them as blackheads for a while (months) but nothing has happened so now I target them as sebaceous filaments and I think I've already seen some improvements. Other concern is uneven tone and my skin seems to miss that healthy glow as well.

**My goals** are to reduce the appearance of the dark spots on my nose area, to even my skin tone and to give it that healthy glow.

I've used the listed and pictured products for about a week now.

Lush perfume Sun. Not a skincare product but smells like citrus candy and I love it.

Aco Rescue Mist. I bought this for a flight to keep my skin moisturized and it's wonderful. It's lightly scented and smells and feels super fresh.

Aco Soothing Body Lotion. I use this to moisturize my body, it's not scented, and leaves my skin nice and soft.

&#x200B;

**Bottom left:**

TO Caffeine Solution 5%. I love this one, it's used on the eye contour area and already after a few days my eyes would get significantly less puffy and I feel like it's also evened my slightly dark under-eyes. Feels nice and fresh and massaging it on the eye area really wakes me up.

TO Lactid Acid 10% + HA. My first chemical exfoliator (the store that sells TO products here didn't have the 5% one so I just started with this one, my skin handles it well, doesn't hurt or irritate). Before I felt like I had to constantly physically exfoliate to keep my skin clear but this stuff leads to better results and more gently than physical exfoliators.

TO 100% Organic Rose Hip Seed Oil. I love this one. Before my skin would get dry on my forehead and cheek area which led me to exfoliate more but with this oil my skin stays hydrated and it gives me a bit of a glow without making my face look oily.

TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%. I use this to brighten my skin tone and to reduce the appearance of the dark spots on my nose and it seems to be doing it's job well! Nothing dramatic but then again I haven't used it for long now.

&#x200B;

**Bottom right:**

&#x200B;

Holika Holika All Kill Oil to Foam Moisture. I use this to wash my make up off my face. I spread it on my dry face, rub a bit and then slowly add water bit by bit to make it foam. I love the feel of it and it washes even heavier eye make up easily and effortlessly.

Holika Holika All Kill Clay to Foam. I use this after the oil one and I absolutely love it. The clay dries on your face for 3 minutes and I usually brush my teeth in that time. Then I slowly add water to make it foamy and clean it off my face, cleanses incredibly well but doesn't dry my skin one bit.

TO Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA. It's a nice moisturizer that my skin absorbs quite quickly and it feels nice. Nothing special to say about it but seems to do it's job.

TO Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%. This one stings like hell because my skin is not used to vitamin C products but it's getting better every time I use it. Does it's job though as I feel like my skin tone has evened already.

Edit: Formatting, originally posted from phone. Add more pink and it'll be an instant r/vaporwaveaesthetics [deleted] Love the minimalist look! r/oddlysatisfying  [deleted] I see these shelfies daily and it makes me very jealous All Kill? I've not heard of this brand, please tell me more.  I'm fairly new to this group and constantly see people posting about the rose hip oil, what's all the hype over this ? Do yall consider it a holy grail ? If so, which brand should I try? Oh my gosh. This is so lovely, are you sure it isn't a screen shot from an Into the Gloss spread? Lol. For real, though, it's beautiful.  Hello fellow nordic person! Really like your reviews on the ACO-products, going to try them out! I love the plants  THIS  IS BEAUTIFUL! I thought that was Goku's hair on the top shelf r/vaporwaveaesthetics /r/accidentalwesanderson What do you think about the ordinary products?  Do you like the ordinary?

I wasn‚Äôt that impressed  Too cute! I'm moving in a few months and your shelfie is style goals! This shelfie is so good it's turning me on I have a lot to learn from your shelfie Well, this is the most satisfying sight so far in 2019.  It‚Äôs just...so... beautiful! üò≠ Looks like a magazine how beautiful  This is very pleasing to my eyes! Very pretty picture! 

I do want to give a slight warning for using an 5% AHA (pixi) and a 10%AHA (TO lactic acid) both everyday, i think that is a lot of AHA and that it might be worth to try AHA only in AM or PM (or every other day). For most people the best effects are not achieved by using high percentages of acids or using them multiple times a day, but if your skin and you are happier with them twice a day you should use both ofcourse!  What is your favorite product from The Ordinary? Mine is the caffeine eye solution. It really does tighten and brighten the eyes. The buffet is a close second though. Aesthetique TM a e s t h e t i c Wow, I am in love with your setup! That is such a beautiful, well-organized, shelfie. It looks like a stock photo But where are the gobs of toothpaste or strands of hair? Why aren't any of the caps to your containers missing?  Love this! You may have better results if you use the natural moisturizing factor before the rose hip seed oil, as I believe it acts as more of a hydrating ceramide and oils tend to seal things up to keep moisture in.  TO site generally recommends using oils as the last step after things you want to absorb, just before any primers or suncare.  Looks great, and easily accessible, which is important! Very nice! Nice! Do you recommend The Ordinary's NMF + HA? I'm looking into buying it. :) So aesthetically pleasing!! Yikes, too much time on your hands [removed] Thank you! I add plants everywhere in the apartment, I love the feel they bring into a space - even as small as this! Torille? Hahaha yeah couldn't hide it in the picture without cropping too much. It's a reminder/warning sticker because the cabinet has a residual-current device that needs to be tested monthly (kuukausittain)! This is one of the most relaxing, soothing looking shelfies I've ever seen. Thank you for this thorough post!!  I might have missed it; what are in the white boxes, and also where did you get the white boxes?? I love them. you mentioned that you targeted those large pores as sebaceous filaments, how do you specifically target those sf's, i have some really nasty ones on my chin that never seem to go away

&#x200B; Aren't we supposed to not use AHAs (the lactic acid) and Vit C at the same time as they would make the Vit C not effective? ü§î Ooo somebody with really similar skin to mine! I have a few of the same TO products as well. I've been trying SO HARD to get into the Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, but it seems like everything I put on afterwards seems to pill up like crazy (I'm guessing it's either silicones and/or oils in other products, but I can't get rid of both of those ingredients... blah). Do you find you have the same issue? Any tips to avoid? I'm possibly using too much of the Niacinamide so I'm willing to give it another shot.

I also have the Lactic Acid and the Moisturizing Factors but haven't been using them regularly. Will work on incorporating them. If you have any recs for articles you read (etc!) while shopping for your specific skin goals I'd love to hear about them, because I have the same ones!

Thanks for posting such a thorough explanation. Love the shelf. Slave to the wave Thank you so much!  Thank you so much! I go for a very spa feel in my bathroom overall, it motivates me to take care of myself. The brand is actually Holika Holika! All Kill is their line of products that are specifically suitable for sensitive and dry skin, but work on all skin types! The oil to foam one has HA in it and feels really moisturizing and nice while easily removing make up I love it. The clay to foam one is so gooood as well it's probably my favorite product on the shelf right now. It has canadian white clay in it which really cleanses deeply and the alteromonasa soothes the skin, reduces irritation and skin sensitivity.  There are no 'holy grails' for *everyone*.  Rosehip oil has been gaining in popularity for the last couple of years. Its a dry oil (meaning it shouldn't leave skin feeling greasy) and has some vitamins and fatty acids that many people like in a skincare routine. That said, it can go rancid fairly easily and is often mixed with other ingredients, like vitamin e oil, to extend shelf life. So just how much rosehip you're actually getting will vary quite a bit from brand to brand.  Personally not into it, but lots of people are. You'd really just have to try it out for yourself.  It has anti-inflammatory properties so it can help decrease redness and scarring. Youtuber Thataylaa raves about this as one of the biggest things to help with her scarring post-Accutane. I have dry skin and like to mix this in with other oils, definitely enjoy it.  Thank you for the compliment!!  Hej, tack so mycket haha! Yeah they are really nice, and their vanilla lip balm is the absolute life saver especially in our nordic winters! Thank you! I feel like plants can really finish up a space. THANK YOU! I do like them a lot, but I haven't used them for long now, only a bit over a week. But they are affordable, I love the packaging and they seem to work well on my skin! My favorite is the Caffeine Solution which works wonders for my previously puffy eyes in the morning and I also love the Rose Hip Seed Oil since it keeps my face nice and moisturized without making it too oily! The Lactid Acid also works great for me as an exfoliator and my skin seems a lot better with it than with using physical exfoliators. The Niacinamide I'm not yet sure of, haven't experienced dramatic changes but my skin tone seems to have evened up slightly. The Vitamin C Suspension hurts my face so bad because I'm not used to Vitamin C products and it's a pretty strong one but mixing it with the oil helps. My skin seems to have brightened up though so it seems to be working. All in all I think they work well and seem to be headed in the direction of the results getting even better over time! I do like them a lot but keep in mind that my previous experience with skincare was products you find from supermarkets heh. But TO products do seem to work well on my skin so far, my opinion might of course change once I dig deeper into the world of proper skincare! Thank you so much! Thank you! Took me years to develop my own style for what I do so this is nice to hear. Damn what a compliment thank you! Also happy cake day! Small steps at a time and you'll find your own style! And we're already on day 2 wow! Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you!! I'm glad people find my style pleasing, thank you! Thank you and thank you so much for the warning! I'm probably going to try the Pixi once a day then and another, more soothing toner alongside it. My skin seems to be happy with AHA but I'll be careful, thanks again! Yeah I love love the Caffeine Solution it works wonders for my eyes! Other than that the Rose Hip Seed Oil works really well for my skin, hydrates nicely but doesn't leave my skin oily. Haven't tried Buffet so unfortunately I don't have an opinion on that, might have to check it out though! Thank you so much! Thank you so much! Haha I am crazy about cleaning and decluttering and organizing so that helps a lot. And I care way too much about aesthetics and the way my living spaces look like, to the point where my bf sometimes has to stop me from going completely crazy with it. Thank you and ooh thank you for the tip! When I did my little research I read that the moisturizer should be the last thing as it locks the moisture in from all the products then but I'll switch to using the oil last. Thanks again! Thank you so much! Yeah I really try to make sure everything is easily accessible because I know that if it is not, I will get too lazy to keep up my routine heh. I try to invest in products that look pretty to me or I repackage products that don't please my eye that much in cheap glass containers for example. This way I can keep them visible and easy to access without compromising my aesthetics, which I care way too much about but oh well. Thank you so much! Hi there,

Do they get enough light there? I‚Äôd love to do the same but I only keep plants on my windowsills as I‚Äôm worried they won‚Äôt get enough sun, my house is quite dark :(  Hahah liian kylm√§ nyt! Thank you! I try to bring minimalistic and relaxing aesthetics into all corners of my apartment, it really helps me to relax at home after a long day when even my bathroom shelf makes me feel calm. This was my first time posting here so I was kinda afraid I was doing something wrong or not being thorough enough haha so thank you! I did mention where they are from but I'll add it here again, also thank you! The big white box on the top shelf is from Ikea, it was part of an office box pack or something. The two smaller white ones have been with me for about 10 years now so unfortunately I cannot remember where they are from. I do remember that they came with this square white shelf that was divided into four parts and each one had a box in it. Sorry that I can't be more of a help! 

As to what is in them, the top shelf one hides all the dental hygiene stuff like toothbrushes and mouthwash. The other smaller one has my lip balm, antiperspirant and sunscreen in it and the other has my bfs stuff like antiperspirant and hair wax. I just hid all the everyday stuff in there that wasn't in aesthetically pleasing packages haha. I would like to know too! I'm not so sure either I'm so new to this! I heard that BHA and retinoids help so I just discarded my physical exfoliator that was supposed to help with blackheads but did nothing and bought the 10% AHA to get my skin used to acids so I can buy the TO 30% BHA later on. I'm also going to buy a retinoid product to see if it will make a difference but wanted to get the basics down first. I'm really so new to this that I can't give great advice, I'm sorry! Also someone please correct me if I'm wrong. You might be thinking of niacinamide and vitamin C. AHAs + vitamin C is an okay combination, you just run the risk of overexfoliating or irritating the skin. 

~~Niacinamide and vitamin C combine to make niacin (?) which pretty much cancels all of the benefits from the separate products.~~

eta: [Turns out](https://theklog.co/can-you-use-vitamin-c-and-niacinamide-together/) this is a [myth](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/myths/can-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-be-used-together.html). As always, patch test and add products slowly, but these two can be an okay combo as well!  I think I read this on TO‚Äôs website. For that reason, I only mix my vit c with resveratrol.  Hi similar skin person and thank you! I can't say I've had any problems with the Niacinamide because the only things I put on my face after it are Moisturizing Factors and sunscreen since I only use it in the mornings. Maybe you could incorporate it to your AM routine only for example? I only really need 2-3 drops for my whole face too, it soaks up really quick but I still feel like my whole face is covered with it.

Lactid Acid works great for me instead of physical exfoliators but Moisturizing Factors I don't really have an opinion on. My face does feel soft and hydrated after it so I guess it does it's job. 

Unfortunately I don't really have any articles etc to recommend, I just lurked around on this subreddit and learned about TO, went to a website that sells them here and looked for products that would help with the skin concerns I have. I mostly get my info on this subreddit plus I'm super new to this so I feel like I am lost most of the time haha, sorry that I couldn't help with better recs.

 That‚Äôs a good idea to repackage, aesthetics are important for me. I‚Äôm gonna use that. They seem to be doing fine just now, but I'll move them away to a spot with more light if they start looking worse and decorate my shelf with something else then! Do you have a blog or Instagram I can follow? Or  do you have any interior design blogs or Instagrams you'd recommend? Where are the white bins from? Lovely shelfie!  I am so here for that motto! You've inspired me!  I would really like to know where you got this cabinet/shelves! It's actually my sunscreen that pills up so badly with the niacinamide :( I just bought a different one without silicone in it so we will see if that helps... I was using half a dropper of it, then mixing the same amount with hyluaronic acid (it only helped a tiny bit). So I'll switch to 2-3 drops.

I'm doing the same research and it sounds like we landed on at least 3 of the same products, so that's a bit of confirmation there at least! Thanks for the help. I work in an ER with no windows and one of our docs is into succulent art. We keep a succulent bowl in there and once every couple months we put it under A UV light to recharge it and then put it back. It does really well.  [deleted] Sansevieria are notoriously forgiving. Keep an eye on it for sure but they are fine with fluorescent lighting alone. I think the only thing that kills those hardy suckers is overwatering :)  My gosh this is honestly probably the best compliment I have gotten in ages so thank you! You're also making me doubt my decision to not pursue a career in interior design haha. Unfortunately I don't have a blog and my instagram is just random artsy pictures that have nothing to do with interior design. I've been thinking about starting an instagram that focuses more on the way I like to design my living spaces so maybe I'll get started on that! I'll comment it here later if or when I get it going on then. I also can't recommend any blogs or instagrams since I don't follow any, my style has just formed over the years and I pick up things from here and there. Sorry that I can't be more of a help! Thank you! The big white one on the top shelf is from Ikea, it was a part of some sort of office box pack. The two smaller white bins have unfortunately been with me for about 10 years now so I cannot remember for the life of me where they are from originally. What I do remember is that they came with this square white shelf that was divided into four parts and each had one bin in it, but that probably doesn't help much.. Aww thank you so much I'm so glad to have inspired someone!  Aawwwh hopefully the new sunscreen works! Mine works great with the Niacinamide at least if your new sunscreen has problems with it as well, might wanna try out the one I listed next then.

Hopefully we were both correct about the products then haha! And no problem, thanks to you too! That's good to hear, I wanna take care of these plants but I love the way the shelf looks right now so I'm glad to hear they should be okay! Also succulent art sounds really interesting! Thank you for the info! I'm gonna get those then if these aren't going to be happy on the shelf. Thank you for the info, glad to hear they should be okay! !remindme 2 days Of course! Please consider it - I love your approach. It seems grounded and guided by how a space makes you feel, not necessarily how it looks. It's an important distinction that I think would set you apart in the field. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Who's to say you have to dive into a whole career? Even just a themed Instagram could satisfy your creative energy and our cravings. Best of luck in the new year. Just wanted to say thank you. Lovely bins!

|-|-|-|-|-|-| Have a thank you right back at you! I would give anything for my husband to even wear sunscreen üò≠ I tend to gravitate towards vegan/vegetarian/cruelty-free lines simply because of personal reasons. I also find most of the formulas to be less irritating due to different ingredients.

I'm a male in my early 30's. My skin used to have significant breakouts when younger, but it's mostly calm now. My face gets very oily by end of day, but is known to have combo/oily moments every now and then (which is why I exfoliate so much). I guess my biggest concern is maintaining what I have/beginning an anti-aging line.

I live in Phoenix, and I am trying to figure out how to incorporate more Vitamin C into my routine. I just feel like I'm already using a lot of product, so I don't know where to add the steps in.

&#x200B;

AM Routine

* Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Pore Perfecting Cleansing Gel: Shook. Just discovered this at Sephora. Goes further than Jan Marini BioGlycolic Face Cleanser and is also soap free.
* Lush Ultrabland: I alternate this with the Dr. Gross cleanser. It is amazing. I feel hydrated without a greasy feeling, and using a washcloth helps exfoliate as well.
* Lush Eau Roma Water: A great combo of rose/lavender water. I used to use the Mario Badescu line, but I feel like this one is much more mattifying. I use this later in the day as well to help with oil.
* TO Agireline Solution: I honestly feel this one work, maybe it's just me though.
* TO 100% Plant-Derived Squalane: Very lightweight, although I know they just released a lighter formula.
* Brickell Restoring Eye Balm: Just started this one...I like it so far.
* Josie Maran Argan Daily Moisturizer SPF 47: I have struggled finding a good day sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast in my beard. This one has been great.

PM Routine

* Niod Sanskrit Saponins: I love the formula and how clean my skin feels without being tight/stripped.
* TO Alpha Lipoic Acid: Not every night, but this works quickly, and I feel no irritation. My skin feels smooth almost instantaneously.
* Lush Amazon Primer Naked Facial Oil (Not Pictured): I like this because it's mattifying.

As Needed

* Jeffree Star Velour Lip Scrub: The pot is massive for the price. I love lip scrubs. It says Blueberry Pie but it's more of a blueberry pancake flavor.
* Face Masks: I usually grab whatever Korean masks they have at Nordstrom Rack...I should probably find one that I can use consistently.

&#x200B;

I would appreciate any recommendations for a night moisturizer or Vitamin C product to squeeze in here. Also, if there is anything you think I should maybe change in my routine I would greatly appreciate the feedback. I love Lush‚Äôs toners. A MAN YOU DONT SAY Where did you get those pumps for the ordinary bottles!!!!!!!!?! I really like Dr. Brenner's vit c serum, from amazon. It's light weight and sinks in quickly.  I either use it alone at night (after cleanser or toner), or sometimes with a lighter moisturizer. I haven't liked the feel of TOs C products.  They tend to feel gritty on my skin.  No thank you. Josie Maran spf is my favorite! I have super dry skin and it makes me glow in a good way without being greasy. Happy to see someone else using it! The pump hack is super helpful! Theres a lush in the mall near me but i wasnt sure if their products were actually good for your skin or not Do you think the TO products travel well with the pumps? The way they‚Äôre originally packaged made them spill on my last trip even though I had completely closed them Where did you get the little pumps for your Ordinary products? How do you like the Josie Maran SPF moisturizer? I‚Äôve had my eye on it for a while but some comments on Sephora allude to a reformulation gone wrong. Ultrabland is the best! I‚Äôm combo/oily and I find that I need a lot of moisture at night (I‚Äôm on prescription tretinoin, so it‚Äôs pretty much mandatory to keep flakes at bay) and depending on that particular night‚Äôs routine I either use TO NMF (imo this is the best moisturizer ever made for oily skin) or a gel-based sleep pack to seal in the goodness. Belif aqua bomb is a great sleep pack, also PTR cucumber mask (it sounds crazy but it makes a better leave-on sleep pack than a rinse off mask). Love this! My one recommendation would be to add a sunscreen in the am!‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm combo/oily and found that the yes to coconuts works when I apply it at night before bed. I use a face oil and then a sunscreen if I leave my house in the AM. Also in Phoenix area! Kind of off topic but how do you like the bluberry lip scrub? I've been thinking about getting a JS lip scrub for a while since my favorite Lush isn't made anymore. Is the scent/taste good? I don't want anything too strong. Wow, I am jealous.  I have crappy skin and feel like there is so much information on this sub and online that I have no clue where to even begin.

I am just starting with a Cerave cleanser, a moisturizer, and sunscreen and see what happens from there, I guess.  But I hope to get to your level one day sir. How do you use the Jose marine? It sticks to my face and I have to mix it with another product. I love the alpha lipoic acid! I swear it brightens on contact How do you like the Josie maran SPF ?? Is it greasy? [deleted] That sunscreen by Josie Maran is THE shit Nice collection!!! How do you integrate shaving into your routine? I'm thinking about wetshaving and I'm not sure how to do that yet So would you recommend TO‚Äôs anti wrinkle/line products? My face is generally okay but my neck is super wrinkly already. Thank you for the idea of the caps on the ordinary products. I just bought them! Also planning on making my boyfriend try some simple skincare, any that people recommend? Are those little pumps on The Ordinary bottles from their makeup bottles (or similar)? THAT IS SO SMART. Every man should have the basics! What are your thoughts on the Ordinary range? The ordinary is my new favourite brand üëåüòç Jealous of that NIODü§ß What recommendations did you get for vitamin c? I‚Äôm trying to decide between the timeless and mad hippie but now I‚Äôm seeing a ton more recommendations and am completely lost. I‚Äôm currently using up the truskin from amazon but am pretty sure it‚Äôs not effective and I got conned into getting it with fake/paid reviews. Anyone else who can help, I would really appreciate it (I have dry skin if this helps)! Ugh good for you. It is so refreshing to see a man take care of his skin. 
Plus the JS Lip Scrub made me giggle a bit. Keep up the good regimen! Can you tell me more about the Dr Gross cleanser? It sounds interesting! I use the Dr Gross 2-part peels and really like them so I‚Äôm interested in other items in the line.

I‚Äôm also looking for a new morning eye cream, so what does your eye balm do exactly? If you don‚Äôt mind answering ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è I feel like there‚Äôs always a negative stigma around men who are into skincare, and I‚Äôve never understood it. GOOD SKIN FOR ALL! What's everyone's obsession with the Ordinary? Is it any good? Those pump heads!! Where do you get it? I would love my serums to have pump like yours, much more convenient and sanitary. LUSH! You got good taste op! Love that store. Just walking in smells awesome. Nice lush Are the pumps on your ordinary bottles just generic ones? Thanks! I use a daily retinol spot treatment during the day with sunscreen. Good to known about doing it nightly instead of during the day. Where did you get the pumps for your TO bottles? I'd love to be able to just pump out the product instead of fiddling with the droppers haha. Where did you get the pumps for the ordinary üòÆ A man indeed. I‚Äôve been curious where to start. You put me to shame. I am loving everything about this picture. It‚Äôs so lovely. Amazing skin care collection!! Keep it up! This is such an aesthetically pleasing array of products.  Clean, simple packaging rocks my socks. Hey! Can you tell me about your skin care routine? THOSE PUMP TOPS FOR YOUR TO PRODUCTS. WHERE DID YOU GET THEM. I wonder how your skin looks like [deleted] You must be a very handsome man That's hot Which ones for jerking off ? American Psycho red flags ...standing in front of you, asking you to admire my shelfie ;) I have family members who are manly men and didn‚Äôt protect their skin and have leathery, sun-damaged skin now. I don‚Äôt want that. No one should want that. [removed] My bf has dry skin. The other day I forced him to wear sunscreen and he said his skin felt comfortable all day. I'm so happy! He's wearing it everyday now so I'm ecstatic. Just tell him it's man cream or some bullshit and that James Dean swore by it. Maybe slap a *RedBull* sticker on it. I know! I have had some success getting my boyfriend to wash his face at night, but if we don't go to bed at the same time- forget about it. This is one of the stupid gender roles. Why is taking care of your skin super unmanly. I don‚Äôt want to touch a leathery skinned person. My husband will do face masks with me and let me create him a skin care routine. (His skin is similar to mine so easy to figure out). He tells me ‚Äúit makes my skin feel nice when you do your stuff‚Äù. I have to make threats just to apply a nose strip on mineüò´ Omg tell me about it I'm trying so hard with my boyfriend üò© Absolutely need to know where you got those amazing push pumps for TO products üòç What a genius idea! Appreciate seeing another guy who's really experimented and thought about his routine!  

 I use TO ascorbic acid (vit c) powder mixed every day with my moisturizer.  It's a bit of a pain in the ass, but I like that you can experiment with different 'doses' and see which works best.  Also just seems less doctored, which I like. Hello! TO Niacinamide helped me soooo much with the excess sebum my face produces after a long day. Although I'm sorry I'm not sure if it's vegan. A man who cares about his skin AND is ethically/environmentally/amazingly conscious? You are the real deal! ü•∞üòç

As for vitamin C, üíØ% Pure has a Vitamin C product. Also, Andalou, Derma E and some other brands at whole foods have nice vitamin c products.

Oh and Sun Bum has a nice sunscreen (I got the TSA sized one) called Zinc Oxide. It's clear. My boyfriend loves it and so do I. A tad bit greasy but it feels luxurious going on (at least for me it does). Groupon has sets of 11 tonymoly sheet masks for $10! I have been buying them in bulk instead of the individual $4 For moisturizer I use NMF and rose hip seed oil. I also use Pycnogenol and I‚Äôll either mix it with the retinoid emulsion 2% or the Vitamin C 23%. The Pycnogenol is also a hydrator as well as an excellent antioxidant >  My face gets very oily by end of day

What do you do to control oil near the end of the day. I feel like we have similar skin types based on what you're saying. I really like Ole Henriksen  Truth Serum for Vitamin C. It‚Äôs super smooth, a little goes a long way, it absorbs fast, and it smells awesome. Your skin is incredible and your routine is almost perfect, but I would recommend adding a retinoid for the PM routine, just for additional defense against photoaging and oxidative stress. I use TO's Granactive Retinoid 5%. It's already in squalane so I don't need a moisturizer after it. It's not irritating at all and makes my skin super soft when I wake up in the morning. I use 5-6 drops for my entire face and neck, and let it absorb for at least 30 minutes before I go to bed. Lol didnt know jeffree star had skin products, i mean it makes sense Male here, have you got facial photo. I‚Äôve been trying to get myself a routine, I do use a few products but would love to see a photo to compare mine to yours. I've been liking drunk elephant c firma for vitamin c. They are getting sued by skinceuticals (which supposedly has the best vitamin c) , so must be doing something right. Could you do a mini review for the Alpha Lipoic Acid? I've found that Skinceuticals have the best vitamin c products. They are expensive, but the bottles last a while and my god the formulations are beautiful. 

Whatever vitamin c you use, a few reminders. 

1. Use it in the AM 
2. Put it on right after you cleanse your face. Should be the first layer on your clean skin.
3. Don't forget your neck. I've been happy with TO vitamin C, what are your thoughts on TO squalane? How were you able to defeat breakouts? Just outgrow them? Please tell me all the details about Argireline. Do you use it all over your face or do you spot treat? What sort of results have you seen? How long did it take?

Ty. Me too. I was so hesitant to use their skincare line for the longest time but there‚Äôs definitely some items worth checking out. I love seeing other men who use Lush! I used to have terrible skin in high school and absolutely saw a difference when my friends in college introduced me to Dark Angels and Celestial. I‚Äôve experimented with a bunch of brands over a decade or so, but I mostly use Lush for hair (Veganese conditioner) and body (currently Rub Rub Rub) now. 

Lately for face I‚Äôve been into InstaNatural glycolic cleanser, a witch hazel/rose water toner, and TruSkin Vitamin C moisturizer, all brands I found on Amazon. I throw on a serum when I feel like it.

I‚Äôve been meaning to try TO products. I‚Äôve seen them popping up everywhere lately! Any recommendations? https://niod.com/product/nid-pump-for-higher-viscosity-niod-serums-30ml-bottle-1pc Order them from Deciem too! They're listed under NIOD I really like it, but since reformulation it‚Äôs just so thick. Like an actual sunscreen. It‚Äôs hard to apply to the neck and hands without two or three more pumps. Have you ever been sunburned using this? I saw that it's primarily a moisturizer with SPF, so it may dilute the actual SPF content. I would love to go back to using this, but is there any evidence that it's actually spf 47 as it claims? Makes a world of difference. Definitely have them do demos and take home a few samples. The cleansers are specifically what you should demo. The lotions are pretty straightforward., but test for sensitivity of course. They're over priced and too heavily scented. Even natural fragrances can irritate your skin/ weaken your moisture barrier The pumps are lockable. I don‚Äôt know how they would hold up with air pressure of on a plane though. They‚Äôre tight and don‚Äôt seem to leak like cheap pumps. Order them from Deciem too! They're listed under NIOD The ones you can buy for Deciem‚Äôs NIOD line fit. They also make TO. That‚Äôs my thoughts. It‚Äôs not a bad product....it‚Äôs just not what it was. It was a REALLY good product before. Now it‚Äôs just ok. It‚Äôs a little thick. But the sunscreen still doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast and still provides basic hydration. I have NMF and I‚Äôm not fond of the texture. But it absolutely made my skin feel hydrated. Aqua Bomb is awesome, but I always felt like I used it so quickly. The only thing from PTR I‚Äôve ever used is the Peeling Gel (which is black magic trickery). 

I‚Äôm going to check out the cucumber mask for sure. Yeah I don‚Äôt think the Josie Maran is doing enough. I‚Äôm looking at a Coola one right now that seems promising. The skin cancer scare is real here. I‚Äôve always wondered about those yes products. Glad to know they work. Was it popcorn by chance? I miss that one. The JS Is great. It‚Äôs really hard to screw them up to be honest. It‚Äôs just wet enough to spread easily. I worked at Ulta when I was younger. Started as a cashier and became a manager. Also managed a counter at Macy‚Äôs and recently did a holiday stint at Lush. I only know what I know because of my experience. I never moisturized before that.

Hell, I barely wore sunscreen until recently. This subreddit is super helpful, and it teaches the chemistry behind it. That makes it easier to determine what works. I apply TO Squalane first and then the JM. That‚Äôs the only way to keep me from losing my damn mind because it‚Äôs so thick. Everyone thinks I‚Äôm crazy when I talk about it because it‚Äôs not a commonly named acid. It‚Äôs amazing. I need to try mine again. I don't really see anything happening the few times I used it. Once absorbed no it isn‚Äôt. I think it‚Äôs an adequate moisturizer, but it‚Äôs primarily a sunscreen and I realize that now. I‚Äôm going to be using a moisturizer under it to see how it fares. It‚Äôs hard to apply without an oil applied to your skin first. At least in my regimen. I was watching a livestream of the former Deciem CEO using it (RIP). It deep cleans without being invasive. It‚Äôs hard to explain. But it‚Äôs worth it. Check out r/wicked_edge! That‚Äôs were I got my start with wet shaving and I‚Äôve never had a better shave I don‚Äôt shave my entire face. I‚Äôve maintained a beard for the last ten years (otherwise I have a Mr. Potato Head jaw). My wet shaving consists primarily of my lower neck and cleanup on cheeks and around my mouth. I wasn‚Äôt blessed with a thick full beard. It‚Äôs curly and slightly patchy and just annoying. 

I exfoliate before a shave with my cleanser or a scrub. I use [D‚ÄôFluff](https://www.lushusa.com/shower/shaving-creams/dfluff/9999908699.html)  from Lush (surprise, surprise). I use a [razor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008O82O7C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_-p38Cb8RBQ80H)  that has treated me well for the last five year (fun fact, Dollar Shave Club uses these blades and rebrands them as their own razors). I use [this](https://m.sephora.com/product/the-cool-fix-P238412) for razor burn. 

I don‚Äôt use my blades more than three or four times, and on occasion get an ingrown hair. I keep exfoliating and just continue with my skincare regimen as usual. 

I hope that‚Äôs what you meant. Otherwise I told you a lot of info for no reason. It‚Äôs easier in practice than theory. I‚Äôve only use me the Agireline solution. Definitely feels like it‚Äôs working. I would read reviews. It‚Äôs pretty popular. Try a cheaper brand to start. TO, The Inkey List, Clinique, or even the Sephora line are great places to begin. Mario Badescu is great too, but their cleansers aren‚Äôt my favorite. 

Try a kit. It comes with the basics and then he can expand from there. From their sister company NIOD. It‚Äôs overwhelming. I bought a few different things and I liked most. Hated a few. I‚Äôd research the products. There are tons of very honest reviews for each. I ended up ordering some items from TO as well as a Sephora run last night. I got the 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder from TO and the Pineapple C serum from Flor Recipe. I‚Äôm gonna mix those and see how they go. Say what you want about him. But If he ever debuts a skincare line I‚Äôm definitely trying it. He‚Äôs very focused upon quality, and it shows in his products. So the cleanser is soap free, but still suds up really nicely. Has a slippery texture and a half pump is typically enough for me. It definitely isn‚Äôt peel strength, but it leaves a smooth feeling similar to after using the Dermalogica Microfoliant. If that helps at all?

The eye balm was one I kept seeing on random websites being recommended by women. It‚Äôs a men‚Äôs brand, but that‚Äôs really just marketing. The main ingredients are Matrixyl, Caffeine, Hyaluronic Acid, and MSM (long name, plant-derived). It has a nice tingle and definitely seems to keep puffiness down. I don‚Äôt have pigmentation issues but it definitely helped when I was sick a few weeks ago and had some visible sinus bleeding (dark circles). It‚Äôs fantastic and you can‚Äôt beat it for the prices Don‚Äôt know why you were downvoted. Certain products are great. Others are okay. At least for me. The nice thing is that there are many products and you can try multiple because they‚Äôre less than $10 each typically. Yep, me too! The link is somewhere in here. Directly through NIOD. They fit all the similarly sized bottles from TO. Check the NIOD part of the deciem website. They‚Äôre in that group. They don‚Äôt fit the larger bottles I don‚Äôt believe. Start with a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Add in more as you go. A lot of skin care companies make starter sets. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help in ulta or Sephora...or blue mercury...or a local department store. 

Clinique has a good men‚Äôs starter set that isn‚Äôt too expensive and you can try some stuff out. The link is somewhere in here. I posted a photo I‚Äôm this thread somewhere. It‚Äôs in here somewhere already. My mom and boyfriend think so. Lol Men achieve true liberation in life when they give up all the fake ‚Äúmanly‚Äù shit and aren‚Äôt afraid to use skincare products and take care of their appearance. My hub uses the lush facial and beard cleaner. I like it but I'm curious how you like the ultra bland cleanser? I bought one that was like Angel's on bare skin or something and its mashed up almond powder. Not a fan i went on a trip with a friend of mine once. 

in the morning: "why are you putting all that on your face? why the sunscreen? it's england." 

that night: "you're HOW old?"

question asked, question answered, my guy I have explained to him about sun damage, he lets me put sunscreen on his face and neck when we go on holiday, only because his skin is very pale and freckly so he gets sunburnt easily.

But the problem is, addressing what everyone else is been commenting, his hatred for skincare has nothing to do with toxic masculinity. Ive talked to him about moisturizer and suggested we do face masks together (he loves anything  that we can do together) but as he‚Äôs explained to me, it‚Äôs not because he thinks those are girly  things, but that having wrinkles and freckles is natural and he‚Äôs supposed to have them and see no reason to fight against nature :( I forced my super simple skincare onto my boyfriend who had dry skin after accutane. Literally a face wash and moisturiser, a glycolic acid once or twice per week and sunscreen in the morning. (I use super gentle, fragrance free stuff, so little chance of him reacting badly.)

I celebrated my ultimate victory moment a few weeks ago, when he asked if I had some lotion for his dry itchy arms. And that from a man who refused to wear lotion *while on accutane* because he hated the feeling. Up until then he would rather suffer from dry itchy cracked skin for days than endure 15 min of grease. 

Now he enjoys not being itchy and happily uses up my products... oh well. I would be super happy to! I can tell since he‚Äôs been doing the morning and evening routine his skin is just brighter and looks more moisturized. Makes me smile It‚Äôs not sunscreen, it‚Äôs Sun Defendant he might get the wrong idea if you ask him to cover his face in "man cream"  jk Call it ArmorAll or Meguiar‚Äôs for his skin. üòâ i notice the couple face mask is becoming increasingly popular. its cute. Do you realise how shallow and classist this sounds, in the year two thousand and nineteen? Come ON. So sweet They're the NIOD pumps. They fit all 30mL TO bottles. [NIOD Pump](https://niod.com/product/nid-pump-for-higher-viscosity-niod-serums-30ml-bottle-1pc?redir=1) Was scrolling like a mad man to see if anyone else asked this! Haha thank you :) I am reading up on that. It may be a good idea. The problem is that my Josie Maran moisturizer is somewhat thick, so I am afraid of making it into a paste and causing a mess in my beard. I didn't even know TO made it though. I am going to research perhaps another sunscreen to layer over that I may be able to mix it with. I was considering trying Ascorbic Acid. I only use Vit C. derivatives in my toner. But I was wondering that, as a guy, do you ever find them a little *too* brightening?! According to The Ordinary's website [it is vegan](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-30ml?redir=1) :) I swear that this might sound weird. If I‚Äôm not home I will blot my face with paper napkins from Starbucks. Any brown unbleached napkin should work. 

When home I spritz on the toner in the photo. It helps a lot. That‚Äôs good to know. I‚Äôm going to try a cheap retinoid/retinol and see how that helps. Hey! About the Granactive, did you notice anything else other than smoothness? I have the 2%, but I'm very bad when it comes to consistent use, so I'm just wondering if/when I might see effects Just the lip scrubs currently. I love the lip scrub, OP isn't kidding when he says you get a lot of product for what you pay. I live in Wisconsin & it's a must for the dry winters here. I have the cherry cola one & it is delish! [my face](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ald5OAH7HxOEsi52_d8qmYagCM4r) I mean YMMV. I use it with a cotton pad and swipe on and around my neck, beard, and face before bed. I or it in and then continue my regimen. There‚Äôs some warmth, so test it out before continuing as it may be too much for some. I‚Äôve had no redness or any issues from it. 

My skin feels smoother almost instantly. It definitely helps even everything out. Shouldn't it be put on at night because the sun breaks down vitamin c? I apply it with a cotton pad to my forehead, eyes, and around my mouth. For me, it feels as almost if the skin is tightening itself. It‚Äôs nothing dramatic but you actually feel it do something. Seems to make a light difference over time. Apparently Matrixyl is much stronger but I‚Äôve just been taking baby steps in that direction. I was the same. I use their Celestial face cream as well, and it‚Äôs one of the few things my super sensitive skin can handle. There‚Äôs a lot of TO to choose. I would grab one or two things and branch out from there. The oils are great. The quality is high and the price is very low. They have a few moisturizers but I‚Äôm not keen on the texture. Buffet seems to be a very popular solution for anti-aging on their website. 

Also, I swear by Lush‚Äôs American Cream conditioner. That conditioner is amazing. I‚Äôve wanted to try Veganese but it‚Äôs so hard to change. Also, Mamma Mia is their new scrub and it‚Äôs definitely a spicier scent if you like warmer scents. Just wanted to say I used to buy all my skincare stuff off amazon including the InstaNatural glycolic cleanser, retinol moisturizer, & rosewater toner. I switched out all my stuff for similar products from the TO. My skin loves it but also if you buy from their website it‚Äôs half the price that TO products are on amazon. When I bought from their site it was only $20 to get free shipping. They‚Äôre so cheap too!! Thank you I love you lol I need help here..the link is for the product or just the pump? I want to get my shelf going but also have the pumps. Thank you for linking this! I haven‚Äôt noticed a change, unless they reformulated very recently? Honestly I‚Äôll apply a heavier sunscreen over it if I‚Äôm going to be out in the sun extensively. I live in Phoenix so in the hotter parts of the year it‚Äôs a mad dash from car to wherever you‚Äôre going. I‚Äôve never been sunburned using it. I‚Äôve been sunburned using regular sport sunblocks though. SPF ratings are regulated by the FDA, so it has to meet the standards of being at least spf 47 to be able to state that on the packaging. I agree. LUSH can be pretty hit or miss, so I think the best thing is to try some products in store and get samples and see how your skin likes it. Alright, thank you for the info! I think YMMV but I think they‚Äôre priced fairly and I love the farm to face business model a lot of cleaner skincare lines have. 

I‚Äôve only really dealt with the products I‚Äôve used regularly. I‚Äôve sampled a lot of the other ones and wasn‚Äôt as happy with them. Some people love them though. Thank you! Thanks for the feedback. I‚Äôm still struggling to find a good combined moisturizer/SPF (ideally physical) that doesn‚Äôt break me out. Maybe try mixing in one of those oils into the NMF to change the texture? I‚Äôve enjoyed adding the rose hip seed oil and squalene into mine. It really is and it was engrained in my brain to use a moisturizer with sunscreen growing up. I even have a neutrogina mini that I put in my bag for touch ups/in case I forget when I go out often. Have you met people that don‚Äôt put sunscreen on yet? It‚Äôs crazy to me that people don‚Äôt take care of themselves! the yes products are pretty good. Their face masks are often on sale at target, too, btw.

Also - if you ever decide to use the lush herbalism or decide to introduce it into your routine, you can even make the scrub a bit thicker and use it as a face mask! It was The Kiss. Seasonal for valentines but they didn't make it this year :(. And I'm def going to buy a JS one soon. Just need to figure out which one to get lol I‚Äôm thinking of ordering it, what are the benefits? I'm on wicked edge all the time but I am worried shaving soap will contribute to premature aging I'm more wondering how to make sure whatever i put on my face doesn't dry me out, but thanks for the Lush link, my sister in law loves that brand

edit: It looks like their shaving soaps and creams are just the thing Ooh I will, thank you! So many out there. I quite like the range though. Subscribed to a guy on YouTube who tried them. They seem very science based which I like  

https://youtu.be/5NuMa38ijWI Is that the one from TO that everyone says is super grainy and what not? I wanted to try it but I really want to be able to use it during the day. Please let me know how you like it! He's racist... Oh, I love JS products! I agree! I just thought it was cute that you had a lip scrub... didn‚Äôt even realize boys knew they had lips haha It's not only that, they have very clean, transparent formulations. Once you figure your routine, order, what you can mix with what, it's hard to beat. It's custom fit scincare pretty much..

Simplicity of their formulations makes them universal too, some can be used for lips and hair too As a woman those are the men that seem a lot more comfortable with themselves to me. It must feel very freeing. I‚Äôve been seeing ads for ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù skincare products on Facebook. Meh. Drunk Elephant, Kate Somerville and FAB work for me. And unlike buying stuff sight unseen, I can go to my local Sephora and walk out with a sample as well as some help. I‚Äôm pretty damn comfortable in my sexuality/masculinity to go to places like Sephora and lululemon(the two aren‚Äôt exclusive and in different fields of retail, but lulu has a knack for ex-Sephora brass running the show in Vancouver). BUT BUT ***REAL ALPHAS***  DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR LOOKS


/s Part of me gets what your saying but people can be whoever they want however they want with or without skincare. I didn‚Äôt like that one either. A nightmare for clogging sinks too. I‚Äôve sampled the ultra bland one and it‚Äôs very waxy if I remember. Kind of more like a cold cream. I liked it except you have to basically use a washcloth to wipe it to get it all off and my skin was very sensitive to that physical exfoliating. But I have veerrreyyy sensitive and dry skin. I love it. It‚Äôs balmy and melts right on. It‚Äôs easy to remove as well. I didn‚Äôt like Angels on Bare Skin. Too grainy. I was in London in February, and I layered sunscreen even though I never saw the sun. Lol. He will still have freckles and wrinkles with masking. And maybe a little bit softer skin. It's mostly about fun, isn't it? Skin cancer is ‚Äúnatural‚Äù but I prefer to avoid it. Fight cream KAWWWWW "James Dean? Wow... You sure you don't mean James *Deen*?!" I agree with lots of couples doing it now. Just really relaxing quality time together. Thank you üôèüèº Woah, clever duck!! hey u/[peacepiecegracegrays](https://www.reddit.com/user/peacepiecegracegrays/) ... hope it's not weird that i tagged you never actually done that before but i remembered we were both looking for a solution to dropper bottles. maybe this? dang ..!  thank you for this life hack ! [deleted] You just helped me hit the minimum of $25 for free shipping! I mix it with my hydrating toner, which works really well! It dissolves easily, then I pat it in to my skin. It might work nicely with the Roma Water that you use! I just bought the Rohto Melano CC serum, which I'm loving. It's perfect for a first layer in the AM. I tried the TO Vitamin C suspensions but they didn't play well with other products (for me, YMMV). How many pumps on average do you have to put on your hand for Josie maran? I just got it recently and it doesn't spread very well like my other moisturizers but it is good that it doesn't gloss Does the moisturiser (which is also your sunscreen) leave a greasy finish? 
I have a slightly acne prone skin and I‚Äôve been looking for a sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt make my face feel greasy:/ Not for me.  I have texture issues though, so I think it really helps with evening out my skin. I have hella oily skin despite moisturizing a ton and going wash with cleansers, etc. But there have only been two things to permanently stop oily skin throughout the day:

Bypassing my standard moisturizer (Neutrogena Hydro Boost) in the AM and using CosRx Snail Mucin insert. 

Or using Paula's Choice Shine Stopper. It's matte though so if you prefer non matte skin it might not be the best. I try to use as little as possible or get away with the first option if I can. Aha by any means necessary, man.

What do you moisturize with, typically? Retinoids/ols are an investment into the future of your face, used regularly they will even out and thicken lower layers of your skin, making it more resistant and age slower. I've been going at it for more than 5 years now, it definitely works I noticed that whenever I have a pimple, I just massage more of the granactive retinoid on it, and the next day either it's completely gone, or it has flattened and not so painful anymore. Also, since I started using it I don't get that many pimples anymore, even when I do the things that trigger breakouts like touching my face, being stressed, etc.

I've only been using it for around 2 months so far and I am not expecting any results yet as tretinoin itself takes at least 6 months of daily use to see a slight difference in terms of hyperpigmentation (that's where I'm using it), and this one is a tretinoin derivative. Although I've read some studies where it was used on melasma/solar lentigo patients and the results were noticed at 3 months. >my face

your nasolabial sulci look awesome, man Depends on the vitamin c. Most are good anti-oxidants so it's actually helping you out more to use in the day. As long as you use a good sunscreen.

It also depends on your routine. I would usually do other acids and active ingredients (retinol) at night and these generally shouldn't be mixed with vitamin c (too much).

It's no harm to put it on at night, but for most people it fits better in the day. Is Celestial the one that is mattifying? Maybe that‚Äôs Enzymion. I‚Äôm about to go there anyway so I‚Äôll test those out. I need a good night moisturizer. I‚Äôm definitely going to pick up some TO when I need to restock‚Äîor get tired of something I‚Äôm using let‚Äôs be honest.

American Cream smells a little too sweet to me, I tend to avoid Lush‚Äôs sweeter products. Veganese has been amazing but I am also a sucker for citrus. I love it because it gives my hair so much life after having to use dandruff shampoo daily. I haven‚Äôt been to the store in a while. I‚Äôve gotten a ton of emails about their new stuff though! I could spend a f o r t u n e there. That is EXCELLENT to know. I‚Äôm always hesitant about buying from Amazon without reading a million reviews. Some of the prices for the higher end products are redic. I‚Äôll check out the TO site! >My skin loves it but also if you buy from their website it‚Äôs half the price that TO products are on amazon.

one caveat TO's shipping is slow as shit It is the pumps only. 

They have a very slight velvety feel to them btw. I like them a lot. They have trouble pumping oil but not the niacinamide. That's all I've tried them for. Yeah, the argan oil content was lowered and jojoba oil was introduced. Some other things changed too. It‚Äôs definitely not the same formula unfortunately. It‚Äôs thicker and not as smooth. Exactly. If I‚Äôm just going for an afternoon walk in my neighborhood, I‚Äôm not reapplying or using additional sunblock. If I‚Äôm going hiking for several hours, I‚Äôm using regular sunblock everywhere and on top of my face spf (because I still need that moisture!)

That being said, I‚Äôve done impromptu outdoor activities with no available spf to apply over this and my face has never gotten burned. I am careful and try to keep my face out of the sun/wear a hat though, but that‚Äôs not 100%. I just bought this today. I‚Äôm going to use this primarily, and focus the JM on my neck, ears, and hands. [Sublime Defense Fluid](https://m.sephora.com/product/sublime-defense-ultra-lightweight-uv-defense-fluid-spf-50-P311143?om_mmc=ppc-GG_1533944608_60212794284_pla-63707256743_1420223_291191670138_9030087_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&ds_rl=1261471&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxMjnBRCtARIsAGwWnBPNJcctuRpXwbAByVgGg9M_owoAwapVUZB-mvViujaIAlFcIFwz4ggaAonHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) Apparently you should still use a moisturizer even if the sunscreen is a moisturizer. Apparently it‚Äôs too large  to fully penetrate? That‚Äôs what was explained to me tonight anyway. Yeah. No one ever talks about cocktailing products. I should give that a whirl. I have tried a few of those solid cleansers and I found them to be really messy even though I loved how my skin felt with some of them. Oatifix is my jam. Lol he has the whole blue trio for a hood deal. There are so many other flavors though. Blueberry our smelled the best. Yeah that one. It‚Äôs $6. I‚Äôm absolutely going to try it. I‚Äôm sure I can make it work somehow. [removed] Haha yeah we do! Honestly, Lush had one called Popcorn that they discontinued. It was amazing. I still have some but I‚Äôm trying to make it last for the rest of my life. I love LuluLemon. Anyway, yeah men‚Äôs lines are usually just repackaged. The Clinique men‚Äôs line is legitimately their regular line in black bottles. A lot of men‚Äôs lines have a lot of menthol and tea tree attitudes which irritate the hell out of my skin. Also mint. Apparently men like their skin to burn. Honestly I use microfiber cloths. Like the kind you clean your car with. They‚Äôre softer. Thank you! I think I'll just keep stealing my husband's facial and beard cleaner hahaha. I normally just use CeraVe if you make doing something second nature, you won't forget to do it when you need to. like gun safety. so's syphillis My pleasure. Make sure to recycle the packaging....because they can't just throw them loosely into a box for some reason and ship a bunch of cardboard for them. To be honest, the mouths of the bottles get really crusty and gross over time. And yes the exposure is also not something I‚Äôm fond of. There‚Äôs also a higher chance of contamination with a dropper if it touches anything. I came here to ask about the pumps - I find the eyedropper difficult to drop a consistent amount of product, and I hate the thought of cross-contamination. I never thought of that. To be fair I spray it onto my face. Could probably save more product using my hands. Two sometimes three. Feels like way too much. Initially yes, but it does calm down a bit. I just don‚Äôt touch my face throughout the day. I‚Äôve been searching for a mattifying moisturizer because of this specifically. I like the hydration JM gives. Does the shine stopper dry you out? Not skin wise but maybe the sensation? A combo of products. I mix an oil with a sunscreen. Just bought another moisturizer to try as well. It‚Äôs from Youth for the People. I just posted my haul on this subreddit actually. Thank you! May I ask what sunscreen you use, or will you continue using it in the summer? FWIW, I started Retin-A last month and use it every other night. A spot that was the result from me picking away at a gnarly blackhead near my right eye was starting to fade away from my sampling of AHA serums. The Retin-A continued on the work of fading it away. That‚Äôs Enzymion! Be careful if your skin is sensitive, the fruit enzymes in that moisturizer are pretty intense. Enzymion is so mattifying that I didn't like it for night.  Celestial or Cosmetic Lad are better at moisturizing w/o getting too greasy.  I currently use Cosmetic Lad since it's in between the two others. No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs super rich and meant for redness and irritation. All the other face creams raved about in here were too harsh for me, but this was amazing. It‚Äôs very thick, so in the summer I don‚Äôt use as much. I stopped buying anything for my skin off amazon when I noticed the skincare & makeup products were inconsistent with what I bought in stores or directly from the company. Now the only thing I buy there for my skin are the Rael acne patches. Thank you. Any idea where I can find the products? Amazon? Almond, soy & rice bran are the deepest penetrating oils, besides squalene. Olive, avocado, jojoba actually just sit there and don't do much except prevent moisture loss. I use rice bran oil which naturally has squalene and loads of vitamins. I mix 2 drops ea geranium & lavender essential oil into 1 ounce of rice bran. I use it after acids along with a bit of CeraVe.  I do this in the evening and pat off excess before bed, but it's good to have a nice layer going for a bit. My skin is baby smooth and hydrated in the morning. I use TO glycolic 7% 2 -3 x week. Just CeraVe in between.  It's good to see a guy taking care of his skin! My face hates jojoba, so now I‚Äôm looking for new moisturizer! I have a back stock of the good stuff because I always buy the 6 oz bottles two at a time, but that‚Äôs probably only a 6-8 month supply. Same here, but it terrifies me. Lol. Nice, I came across this and felt tempted. Ended up with [something by Ren](https://www.sephora.com/product/clean-screen-mattifying-face-sunscreen-spf-30-P442990), but it leaves a pretty substantial cast and it feels thick. I agree. The way I can get around it is if I use it in the shower. I do love Oatifix! [removed] Mint Julips from lush is really nice. Just looked on their site and they have a limited edition carrot cake one...I need to try that. Apparently one of their facial scrubs smells of popcorn?  I bought it fairly recently and it was lovely. One of the reasons I can't respect Clinique as a brand. It‚Äôs good stuff. Kalamazoo is what your husband has. It‚Äôs a little drying to my skin but the tub lasts forever. That‚Äôs the same with Ultrabland. They make a miniature naked version called Like A Virgin you might like. [deleted] It dissolves really easy in anything I think.  I use CeraVe, and by the time I mix it the consistency is pretty much unchanged. I don't feel like it does honestly. I feel like my sunscreen (Biore UV Watery Essence) dries me out a bit more but when I use it at night like if I'm going out I feel nothing. 

I definitely wouldn't wear it overnight though while sleeping because you'll wake up to an oily nightmare tbh (but it's always been post drinking so I'm not sure if that played into it haha). don‚Äôt do this, it‚Äôll stop the sunscreen from working properly. Good to know and thanks for the ideas, specifically with the beard sunscreen thing. Gonna continue during summer. I use La Roche Posay Anthelios Shaka SPF 50+. I like it coz I can use it around the eye area where I also put the granactive retinoid (dark circles). I did seasonal at Lush and they told us during training that there‚Äôs an entire lemon‚Äôs worth of juice in Enzymion üôÉüôÉ Yeah. I love natural enzymes, but they can be way too much for some. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm going to do Enzymion during the day. I got some samples tonight and will be trying. The price is great on the Lush ones as well. I‚Äôll report back if I end up purchasing it. I ended up getting samples of Enzymion and Vanishing Cream. They‚Äôre both very lightweight. Celestial seemed to be a little thick for my preference. It did leave a nice finish when I tested it though. I get all my Ordinary products and the pump directly from the Deciem website. I tried that one tonight. It was thick. Also tried one from supergoop and FAB. All too thick. There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôd work. I did have one from PCA Skin that was lighter weight. [PCA Skin Hydrator Plus](https://www.pcaskin.com/daily-care-products/broad-spectrum-spf/hydrator-plus-broad-spectrum-spf-30-4.html) [removed] They‚Äôre good quality pumps so far. I‚Äôve used the same one now for my squalane, and I‚Äôve replaced those bottles three or four times now. That‚Äôs good to know. I‚Äôll order some to try it out. It‚Äôs like $5. I should‚Äôve clarified. I apply oil. And then sunscreen. I don‚Äôt mix. The Josie Maran doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast on the beard. It goes away once you run it in enough. That‚Äôs why i bought it specifically. I have the same one! But I got small pimples on my forehead after using it a few times... Don't know if I should try again. So they're both safe for the eye area? I know that LRP (recently?) made another sunscreen which they explicitly advertise as eye-friendly, so I was skeptical about the rest of them. It's fabulous for daytime, especially if you're in an area with more ambient humidity! Awesome! I hope they work well! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Awesome. Appreciate the recs. This one looks promising - I may very well give it a go. Hi there,

I'd like to remind you of our Rule 1: Be kind and respectful.

We'd like our sub to be a friendly and welcoming place. That‚Äôs why I want to ask you to refrain from rude or disrespectful comments here. This encompasses rudeness, trolling, and, in general, being disrespectful. Even if you feel strongly about something, please stay polite. 

Thank you! 

For more information, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_1._be_kind_and_respectful.). [removed] Thanks for sharing! That‚Äôs such a good idea [deleted] Just ordered 4 pumps. Thanks for the tip. u literally said u mix an oil and a sunscreen but good Maybe you're allergic to it, I don't know. Try a 24-hour patch test on the inside of your upper forearm just to confirm if it's the culprit.

Mine says "Very water + sweat resistant, Anti-eye stinging, Sensitive skin, Non-perfumed" on the box. The hemi-squalane is a bit lighter and other brand sugar-derived squalane (Biossance, Neossance) tend to also be lighter than olive-derived, although I don't think TO actually tells us what plant they use lol. I use Biossance and it sinks in beautifully (1-2 drops). It‚Äôs not an uncommon thing that I‚Äôve heard. They made a lighter formula recently (TO) and it seems to have better reviews. I either mix it with my sunscreen or pat it on before applying sunscreen. Apparently I should have also been using a moisturizer. It seems to absorb within a few minutes after though. You‚Äôre right. I typed it with one hand because I was preoccupied. But I‚Äôll let my shame remain on here. Yeah, mine says the same. Thank you, will do! **Hello everyone!**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.*  My skin isn't perfect and I still have a lot of work to do but I love the routine I have now. 

So, here are the products and my review.

[KOSE Softy Mo Deep Treatment Oil, 7.8oz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V2FB88/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

So, this is my first oil that I've been using for a double cleanse . I've really enjoyed it and I often feel like it can clean my skin on its own, it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy either. This was also my first Asian skincare product , specifically from Japan. Love it ! 

[La Roche-Posay Effaclar Medicated Gel Acne Cleanser, 6.76 Fl. Oz.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LO1DNXU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I like this BHA SA wash because it doesn't completely strip my skin of its' oils but does leave it drier than usual. Personally, I think it's one of the better SA washes on the market but obviously YMMV.

[Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Water Face Gel Moisturizer for Dry Skin, 1.7 fl. oz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NR1YQHM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

This was a huge game changer in terms of moisturizers. Most moisturizers are way too occlusive to me to the point that I actually break out because my pores can't breath or so light, I remain dry and unaffected...and thus break out from dryness. This is the happy medium for me. My only issue is that the amount you get in the tub can make you run out quickly, luckily, a little goes a long way.

[Village 11 Factory Sunscreen, Broad Spectrum SPF 50+, UVA/UVB Protection for Sensitive Skin, Moisturizing Hydra Sun Fluid](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074WN9VPB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)

This is a Korean product. This is probably the only sunscreen I'll be using until something happens to the company LOL ! Its consistency is very close to the hydroboost so it just glides into the skin. It smells very similar too. One thing I noticed about this sunscreen is that it contains chemical ingredients as well as mineral ingredients. As someone who has only ever used American sunscreens before, I find this hybrid very unusual (and welcome). Perhaps it's a Korean skincare thing ? Let me know.

The other two are very well known products.

I use TO Niacinimide + Zinc . This was also a game changer for me and I'm just so glad I learned about it. It really helped regulate my oil production and helped the inflammation I get whenever my face get's too hot and sweaty or too dry. I've tried going without it for a month, just to see if perhaps it was just my imagination. Well, I think it's safe to say that it wasn't my imagination , this stuff really works.

I also use TO AHA + BHA chemical peel once or twice a week. I mostly use it for my hyperpigmentation . I know that the SA from my la roche posay is a BHA by itself but I like the extra "oomph" that the AHA does to my skin . Your skin tone is so even! Looking great :) It‚Äôs nice to see a grow ass man having a legit skincare routine. Most of my guy friends just wash their faces with bar soap and call it a day. Looking great, do you use the niacinamide am and pm? Wow your skin is beautiful, so radiant! [deleted] Your skin is brighter than my future Woah you smooth af Hm I thought the dimethicone in my moisturizers was causing my pores to ‚Äònot breathe‚Äô so I was scared to use anything with dimethicone and am using Sebamed gel but it‚Äôs not very moisturizing. I wonder if it was just the specific moisturizers and not the dimethicone. Wow I really like how this shelfie has a pic of the user's amazing progress or results. I feel like it should be a standard format for all shelfies, lol. But not everyone would be comfortable with posting their face. It's just nice to see what the results can be! Your skin tone is very clear  and the pores are not visible in the picture at all!! I am so envious! Would you mind sharing where you bought the Asian products? That‚Äôs what I was thinking!  Very nice! Looking good Would you recommend these products for someone with the same skin tone but with acne? Hey brother! Would you say your skin is oily or combination? Curious because I want to give your routine a try! Thanks. Your skin looks really good Omg I need your glow! Too smooth... goals If your skin isn‚Äôt perfect, I‚Äôm throwing mine away Which one is leaving the lovely glow in your skin ? Your skin looks great! I recently switched to an Korean sunscreen and it is so weightless feeling I'm really enjoying it! Your skin simply glows! I love the Neutrogina hydro-gel! I discovered it a few months ago and it‚Äôs been a game changer. What would you consider your skin type? Your skin is glowing! Looking good!! This neutrogena hydro boost absolutely saves my face. Sometimes when i dont use it, my face dries out so much that it hurts. And it seems like you are not wearing anything when using it. I love it. That is some beautiful skin oh my goodness. Can you please link the exact AHA+BHA chemical peel you use? I've been trying to get rid of hyperpigmentation for the longest time and nothing has really worked. You have beautiful skin! Your skin looks great! Thank you so much for posting about your products. It's nice to know that we all deal with issues, and you're giving many people some tried and true products they can start with :) Literally glowing. Good for you man! This is it, skin goals you guys.
I have problems with hyperpigmentation, and I find that the SPF IS the game changer. I use Mandelic acid and it is really good! Looking good!!! Your skin looks amazing!!! Oooo I'm gonna buy that sunscreen to try out I really want to try this routine!  What is the order that you apply each one?  For the zinc one, does that need to go first? Does the sunscreen make your eyes sting or irritated? Does the hydro boost come in a tube? [removed] Do you shave? If so how have you got rid of your 5 o clock shadow? Your skin is so beautiful You got really even skin man! You mentioned some experience with break outs so I wanted to ask: Which products would you say can help with hyperpigmentation as a dark skinned guy? I'm tryna even out my skin after kinda figuring out how to keep my cystic acne at bay. Appreciate the post ‚úäüèø. Omg I used to use that same exact sunscreen! I thought that nobody knew about it since I hardly ever heard anyone talk about it. I stopped using it because I think it made my eyes water. Have you found that the fragrance irritates your eyes? Screenshot these to look up later! Thanks for sharing. You have beautiful skin! I‚Äôm sorry this is irrelevant but Kose is Japanese üòï Your skin is beautiful and glowy! Does the sunscreen leave any white cast on you? Does the niacinamide work on acne prone skin? Remindme! excellent post, your skin is amazing! thank you for the links and descriptions. i love when a post is so detailed. Aww thanks ! I sure do. I find that consistent application rather than alternating days works best for me. 

I know some people will only use it once daily or every other day. Not really. It's really moisturizing but leaves your face pretty matte. Elta MD is amazing! I just started using it last week and I‚Äôm super impressed because it leaves my skin looking matte and smooth without breaking me out. I have super acne-prone, sensitive skin. MyChelle is a great like for sensitive skin. Very affordable. Buy on Amazon directly, it's cheaper. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2383  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/38432) All of it can be bought from Amazon.  :) Absolutely  ! Believe it or not,  I too am acne prone. 

-Oil cleansing will pick up any dirt and oil soluble pollutants that collect on the face. 

-The SA should help prevent the pores from clogging deep inside your skin in the first place

-The Niacinamide+Zinc will help reduce Inflammation and also regulate your oil producing glans. 

-Moisturizing with a good occlusive that has humectants keeps your skin from drying. Dry skin is the enemy to acne prone individuals because it causes your oil glands to over compensate. It also increases the chances of dead skin cells building up and clogging your pores. 

-Last, but not least, Sun protection is crucial. We are dark skinned and thus have very active melanocytes. We need this so our melanocytes don't have to work so hard. I'm very oily and also sensitive. Hey it's just The Ordinary acid peel. 

The Ordinary Peeling Solution 30ml AHA 30% + BHA 2% https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071D4D5DT/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_4enKDbA4W277V

But Ulta also sells them for cheaper if you have one nearby. 1)Kose oil cleanse

2)La Roche posay cleanser

2b) Apply acid peel (TO aha+bha) no more than 1-2 times per week and no more than 10 mins !! ***

3)TO Niacinamide+Zinc wait a few seconds let it soak in.

4)Apply Hydroboost while face is still a bit damp because you want the Hyaluronic acid to keep the moisture in.

5)Apply sun screen when face dries

That's it. Of course.  

All the American products are FDA approved.

The skin oil is just a bunch of botanicals like Jojoba oil. 

The Sunscreen is also safe too. Asian skin care ingredients might not go through American FDA but that's only because our own approval system is slow and inefficient when it comes to better and newer ingredients. We really need to figure out how to make our system more efficient. No not really. Unfortunately,  I can grow as much as a goatee and that's just about it . ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Kinda sucks but at least I don't have to regularly shave. I'd say my SA wash and AHA+BHA acid peel were the two things that helped. 

But, most importantly,  don't forget the sun screen. I spent most of my life being told my skin was enough and I didn't need sunscreen. That is a lie , we still need sunscreen and it doesn't matter how many acids and serums you put on your face , if the UVB + UVA hits your unprotected face, your melanocytes will over compensate and hyperpigmentate. What products or techniques are using to combat your cystic acne, mine is pretty stubborn at the moment. Actually no. 

I'm not usually a fan of fragrance and I was a little hesitant to purchase it but I think the fragrance added to it is pretty light and subdued.

Though skin sensitivity is always a personal thing , you know ? Ah, sorry I'll change that then . And as for the other poster, I really didn't mean to offend. 

I was just very happy because I've never used asian skin care products and the double cleansing technique before until earlier this year when I wanted to see what all the media hype was about . 

Also, I heard through a few blogs from African American skin experts that sunscreens from Korea or Japan tend to work much better on darker skin tones than American products and don't leave the dreaded white cast. I wanted to say this too. And the ‚ÄúGood Job Korea!!!‚Äù was totally unnecessary and condescending.

Korea (or Japan) has so many good products that many people on here and on r/AsianBeauty love thanks you don‚Äôt need to be surprised at the quality of a product from an ‚Äúuncivilised 3rd world country‚Äù Nope, it glides on and is invisible. I've seen that it can go both ways. For some it makes them break out, for others it's an HG product. I've been scared to try it for this reason but like what if I'm missing out on something amazing?! I have fairly sensitive skin and am also acne prone. After a series of terrible hormonal breakouts, it‚Äôs was the one thing that really helped clear it up. I‚Äôve been using The Ordinary niacinamide for about a year and my skin is super clear now, with the occasional tiny zit every now and then. I never noticed any irritation or redness with it. TO‚Äôs formula is pretty inexpensive (around $10 for the small bottle) and one bottle should last you at least a couple of months, so it‚Äôs worth a try and won‚Äôt break your bank! **Defaulted to one day.**

|-|-|-|-| Which Elta MD sunscreen do you use? Do you find it drying? And are you more on the oily/normal/combo/dry side? Oh thanks I'll check it out! Do you have any suggestions for clog prone skin? Last time I tried Vaseline, my pores were NOT a fan. Seems like they‚Äôre over active (my pores). Thank you so much! Now I gotta wait until my next paycheck to get everything I need haha! Thank you very much! Can you clarify, do you do the same routine morning and night? Also, do you mean you only use the LRP cleanser 1-2 times a week? Thanks! Yeah trust me when you get a 5 o clock shadow your really going to hate it I'll try the AHA+BHA acid peel.  I've been thinking about it, but I'm slow to change up the routine. 

I completely get you with the sunscreen.  Tried to put my lil bro on it and he looked at me like I just dropped down from the moon üôÑ. I'll cop the one you recommended, because my cheap Walmart brand is about to run out. Tryna get like you end of the day haha. Thx. People with darker skin get told they don't need it but in reality, by the time you can see the cancer on dark skin, it is more serious because it shows on light skin earlier. [deleted] Two products have helped decrease my cystic breakouts. 

1) Aztec Indian Healing Clay

I get really oily skin so using this every other day. This is a strong product that is drying. I leave this mask on for 15 minutes before moisturizing.

2) Benzoyl Peroxide 5%

Another drying product. This is the most important part of my routine. This is very strong so I use it every other day, and again leave it on for 15 minutes before moisturizing. 

Disclaimer: I still sometimes get cystic breakouts. If you're already doing/have tried some of these see a dermatologist. I'm seeing mine soon. They can prescribe you stuff that will save you from scarring. I wish I'd gone earlier because I've accumulated a lot of scarring. Exactly! I love the formulation of this product; it‚Äôs everything that you said: lightweight, watery, and no white cast. I just wish it didn‚Äôt make my eyes water üò≠üò≠ No worries! I figured. Just corrected to inform you more that was you can explore the proper products at the correct country üôÇ X I really don‚Äôt think he meant it that way at all. I . . . don't think that was the vibe given off there?? Chill out man. Does it make your face look oily tho? Damn, guess we have no choice but to patch test :) I'll definitely give it a try, hope it works I think it‚Äôs called Elta MD Clear Tinted Not op, but I have super dry skin and it loves elta md. I have no idea how to explain it, it‚Äôs like silky or satin-y when you apply it and it just makes me feel good. Also it has nice stuff in it for hyperpigmentation deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3880  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/44479) I meant the AHA+BHA acid peel is no more than 1-2 times per week.

As for the SA wash , I use it twice daily buuuuut I know some people cannot handle that kind of regimen therefore if you are new to chemical exfoliants , I would start at once daily or maybe every other day and work up from there if you aren't too irritated and can handle it. Definitely so ! If I use a neutrogena product and say ‚Äúgood job America,‚Äù (when I live in an Asian country) would you not take it the wrong way ? Thanks! I agree! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs drying but I do moisturize after removing it at night. My skin is naturally dry around my eyes and lips and oily and inflamed everywhere else. I really like the feel of it on my skin. When I take it off at night, my skin feels extra clear and smooth. I got the tinted version, which pretty much goes on clear/invisible but I feel like it slightly evens out my skin tone and gives me a nice even appearance. Got it, thank you! This helps, as I‚Äôm adjusting my routine which is starting to look very similar to yours. Yes. I would not take it the wrong way. Chill out man. Is refrigeration necessary for skincare products? Or do you just prefer your products to be chilled? Either way, it's a super cute fridge.    This is so great! I'd put beer in there too. The refrigerator is a Coouli Mini Fridge, picked it up at Amazon for $45. It's totally silent so having it on my vanity in my bedroom is no problem.

As you can see, this little fridge holds a lot.  I love it so much I am enjoying the cool feeling of the products (especially the cooking mask) as I apply them.  [deleted] Ever since I saw some USB fridge thats only purpose is to chill a single can of pop, getting something like this has been on my mind. I knew it had to exist! Would be great for oils, like hemp, that need to stay refrigerated.  [deleted] That looks super cool - but right now I'm learning about stabilisators and stuff in training school and our teachers always say how it's dangerous to just Put any creams and stuff in a freezer because some of those don't like deep temperatures either and will Start to do weird stuff with your cosmetics because it lowers their dissolvation rate (probably the wrong word, hope it's still understandable).
So please See if any of these have any warnings in Relation to temperature or contain PHBs.

Would be a shame if any of those go Bad! Here‚Äôs a link to the $45 set of colors - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7IL3BS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_xWe-AbFY3SN55

Here‚Äôs the one OP has for $79 - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0PL5WN/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_IXe-Ab4M27PGV
 This is so cute! And is that the Benton eye cream in there? If so I‚Äôm curious what you think about it! OP, I was contemplating buying a single-can fridge for this purpose the other day. Props to you for turning my wine-soaked thoughts into reality üëçüèª  Heyyy, I have the same one but I use it for breastmilk! üòÇ This is the cutest thing omg  This is next level!! So cute. Love it!  Is that a boob stress ball? I think it‚Äôs good to have tho not entirely necessary, but damn I‚Äôll really like to have one just to feel like I‚Äôm completely on top of my game lol. And man all the masks I‚Äôll keep in there Very nice! I have a mini fridge in my room near my restroom for skincare products, but even at the warmest setting, it can almost get some of my toners too cold, so I may look into something like this.  What is the peach thing? üëÄ I'm curious guys.  Is there anything that definitely *shouldn't* be refrigerated from your skincare routine? Oh man I want one for hot summer nights! I would put cold body butter everywhere  Waste of power Omg, what fridge is that?? Neeeeeddd omg i am so buying one of these...can u put all products in it or is it only good for some What a great idea! Genius.  I just saw these at Pottery Barn (in their teen section, I think)

Also OP, I would love a picture of your full vanity! Is that a Milk Makeup brush holder?! They have those?! üòÆ‚ò∫Ô∏è That's a great idea!
 I want this when I get my own place one day Aaaaand added to my Amazon wish list.  This is so extra I love it I love that idea. This is awesome  I have the same one and love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è This is neat.  I keep a good amount of my products in my fridge and I love it.  Sheet masks are just better out of the fridge.  How do you like the peach hand cream? I too got one of these recently(the pink one, matches my pc case lol). I love it! I keep my eye creams, the serums, and my sprays in there like lush's breath of fresh air, the cold really wakes up your skin! And I get redness and I think the cooler products are soothing.  this is such a hardcore skincareaddiction move and i love it. üòç Lmaoo that fridge. Im buying one just bc of how small it is That... is... adorable. Wow!! Would never have thought of this! Is that shelf removable? I have a couple of creams in tall bottles Where did you get that mirror??? [deleted] Have you tried eye gels? Heavenly!  Awesome. Check out Nerida Joy if you'd like to learn more. She's well versed in couperose  It's not necessary but it does extend the life of some less stable ingredients and keep the potency overall. In general light and oxygen degrade most skincare products. It's recommended to keep the Timeless Vitamin C serum in the refrigerator. Overall, I love how some products (eye gels in the morning or soothing rescue masks especially ) feel.  It is for Vitamin C as it has a very short shelf life :)  I have a beer sippy cup to drink beer and sheet mask in. We have one of these at my job in a small office for nursing mothers that pump! Ack now I want one! Thank you for sharing! Oh wow, I can‚Äôt believe how affordable it is! oh that's awesome to know it's silent! I bought a cheaper one off amazon and the humming was too much for me I took it to work. thanks so much for posting! Dammit.
I want one.  May I ask what you think of the Leahlani aloha?  I've used a handful or her products, and they've done nothing for me, but they smell so incredible that I'm always tempted to try again. [deleted] Is the SK-II mask worth the price?   Shelfie pleaaaaaseeeee Yes! I keep two oils in there now. I first plugged it into the USB port on my vanity but it wasn't pumping out the energy, cooling things enough. So I switched over to the outlet plug. It's pretty cold now, thought something almost frozen. I got one of those mini fridges that only hold one can as a gift. It didn't work as a skincare fridge because it didn't really get cold, it just had some metal plate in the bottom that made a can cold. It didn't really make my sheets or skincare stuff get cold at all so I just ended up donating it to goodwill. My pleasure! I knew skincare subbies would like it. Pretty affordable too. I meant refrigerator, of course. Sorry! I can't think of a reason this would make any of these substances 'go bad'. (I am talking refridgeration).

The dissolvation rate is due to the particles that make up the product, if chilled, now having a lower kinetic energy. Warming them up in the hands before use would overcome this rapidly

Could you point me in the direction of any products that can't be chilled outside of a few niche ones? This doesn't seem to be based on anything  OP said they got the $45 one. Thanks for the links, though! Yes! It is the Benton eye cream. I really like it. It's great under makeup because it absorbs quickly. The texture is difficult to explain. Have you tried the Drunk Elephant Protini? It has that same cream to water gel feeling. Highly recommend, esp for the price and how much you get. I've used triple the price eye creams that aren't anywhere near as good for me.  i cant be the only one who read this as benton ice cream LOL, wine soaked are the best thoughts and ideas!  I use mine for wet cat food!  I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a peach hand cream LOL Ha aha, genius idea!! No, it's peach hand cream from Tony  Moly. It's actually pretty good.  Tony Moly hand cream. I live their fruit shaped containers. The apple, cherry, and tomato ones are adorable.  I don't know, but I'm curious if someone does. I‚Äôll upvote you. It‚Äôs cute but it isn‚Äôt very eco friendly, that‚Äôs for sure. you're absolutely right. thoughtless things like this all add up to harm the environment. sigh An individual has very little impact on the environment to be significant. Amazon - Cooluli Mini Fridge. Approx 45 dollars. Comes in 4 colors. It has almost 1,500 positive reviews,  Seconding that, I love this, what is it called?? Where did you buy it? Depends how many overall products you have. I can't fit my taller bottles but that's ok because I can fit the products that are most sensitive to light (Vitamin C for example).  He he, it's the cardboard box the Milk Makeup face spray comes in. It's sturdy enough for brushes.  Every now and again for promotional purposes :) I like it, much more than I thought I would. It's a totally decent hand cream and it smells like a juicy peach. It's a perfect little Christmas gift or stocking stuffer so I'm picking up a few more. I found it at Ulta.  It is removable  Vanity Impressions. I saved up for a long time for that gem. I do love it, it created my own space in a house full of boys. üò¨ Mature (I'm 41) fairly normal with tendency to get oily T zone (not always) with sensitivity on my cheeks. I used to be oily but now I'm more normal with tendency to get a little oily in T zone with some foundations. Now my main issue is redness from sun damage and some sensitivity on my cheeks. My oily issue resolved with better skincare (layers of light moisturize). What products do we have in common?  I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt admit the thought of buying [this](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sobro-smart-side-table-bluetooth-furniture#/) just for putting skincare in next to my bed has gone through my head.

I‚Äôm kinda lazy and bad with money. This is the content I come here for. TY! TIL! Didn‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôm on my second bottle and I was thinking of stopping as I really think it is making my skin red and blotchy maybe because I  don‚Äôt refrigerate.  I like the way you think  Matchabun you brilliant mofo Omg chilled face masks feel the best! I have a cucumber one that feels amazing, especially with a nice cold beer lol  The electricity bill needs to be considered as well. That is the only thing that keeps me from buying a mini fridge.  Right? I expected it to be at least $100 It's the only product I've ever tried from her so I can't speak to the rest of the line. This oil smells unbelievably good, like fresh jasmine. That's where it ends for me, I haven't noticed any real benefit but I also haven't used it religiously to see if it has any benefits to offer. So, I agree with you: Smells incredible but I can't see any change (good or bad). I guess part of what I love about skincare is the relaxation it can provide, this definitely checks that box.  There‚Äôs no mirror in there? No, IMHO. I don't think any of the SK-II products are worth the price. There are a lot of other products (Secret Key, Missha, CosRX, Skin Watchers) that give similar results. It's a product that's meant to use daily so as long as you maintain that daily application, the fermented ingredients are beneficial. Of course, if money isn't a concern the Sk-II is great, but not necessary.  [deleted] Well, I just wrote an exam about this stuff... But maybe I'm just too concerned. Of course it's all about concentration and other excipients. But at least some of them don't take storing under room temperature for long time too well, because like I said, it lowers the solubility. This can cause the substance to cristallize, flake out, stuff like that. 

If you are lucky it doesn't happen or warming it up a bit will help. But if you aren't your cream suddenly leaves residue, gets crumbly or different stuff. It could even be that you are actually lowering the stability like this, because the cold of course lenghtens it, but if the formula contains a lot of water without the stabilizers and stuff it's still shortened so much that it nullifies.

Sorry if some words don't make sense, english is not my first language. Google is my friend, but often kinda clueless. No prob, and if you look at her‚Äôs and what‚Äôs available - she has a turquoise one that doesn‚Äôt come in the $45 option.  Oh üòÇüòÇ Thanks for the tip üòÄ That‚Äôs very ignorant thinking.  Sigh. $133 for a white one, and $167 for a pink one on Amazon Canada.  How much energy do these things use?  
  
I want to keep my skincare products nice but I also don‚Äôt want to jack up my electricity bill...  Amazing! Thank you! What a brilliant use for it!! I almost want to buy the spray, just so I can have the box.  O my god, I NEED ONE [deleted] I guess it's time to get off Reddit before I go broke.  I seriously need this. Red and blotchy soubds more like your skin is negatively reacting to the vitamin c (or other ingredient). Not refrigerating is more likely to degrade/neutralize (if that happens at all) meaning the actives wouldn't be very active.  Vitamin C is one of those super weird ingredients/products where JUST a tiny bit too much can induce that reaction, but can also be a miracle worker for the same skin. 

I have mad sensitive, finicky  skin - like I once got hives from someone ELSE‚Äôs perfume level of sensitive - and have had to readjust my usage of it often as a result. My advice is to take it out of your routine for a few days/week+, see how things clear up. And, if you add it back into the routine later,  make sure you  don‚Äôt use more than one product that has it as an ingredient. Also, in my experience, it‚Äôs generally not great to combine retinol and vitamin C in the same application /routines - I use serums that have both, so I switch on and off, two days retinol,  two days vitamin C, etc...  I just grab a straw :D I have this little fridge and it doesn‚Äôt use a lot of power. It‚Äôs actually designed to be in a vehicle, and has a couple different types of power cords  This fridge uses 48W; it would cost $5/month to run assuming $0.15/kWh (avg. US energy price). Thanks for the info!  I'm a real sucker for jasmine, so I just may have to give it a try :) Thanks for replying!  I‚Äôll check out the other brands you listed.  Well some people would be interested in that, look at the first comments on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8i276r/personal_arent_most_shelfies_are_just_glorifying/)! Your english is perfectly fine! Thanks for this bit of info and advice :) Your English is fantastic

To find out exactly what's going on id have to ask in a lot more depth and I feel that may bore us both so I won't be  I think hers is the blue one, not the turquoise one. Plus the big ones door opens the opposite direction of the one she has. It must have been offered it in turquoise at some time in the past because she clearly has the smaller one.  

The $79 version is a bigger fridge that holds more.  Note the difference in size and how tall the top shelf is in the larger vs hers.  Ten liter vs six liter.   Mine is 'blue'. The picture makes it look a little different. It's a true cool toned blue.  I should probably explain myself more. OP is capable of making changes in their lifestyle to counteract having this little fridge in their bedroom. But corporations have done a very good job (at least in the US idk about elsewhere) of shifting the responsibility of ‚Äòbeing green‚Äô to the consumer/private individual who has little to no impact on energy consumption compared to retail/manufacturing environment.  I bet you could find one that doesn't list its purpose as 'beauty or skincare' for around the 40/50 dollar mark. Sporting goods or for Maternity supplies for keeping breast milk cold. That's what a lot of people use this for. Let us know if you find something suitable?  Pottery Barn has them, not sure if you have that in Canada! I clicked on the link she provided for amazon.com, the $45 one on the .com site ships to Canada. Try to use the .com site instead of .ca and see if it will come out cheaper. I just went through the whole process (I live in Canada too) without confirming the purchase and it comes to $89 with shipping, tax and customs.  Not sure on this exact brand, but other similar size mini fridges use about the same power as a 40Watt light It's a good travel size spray but the box has been even better.  Same, dude, saaammmee Wow, we are similar. After I finish the Cicapair I'm going to get either the Rejuvi Flavonoid Complex or the isClinical Hydra cool serum. I'm pretty sure what I have is called Couperose. The tiny broken capillaries are because (at least in part) because of weak capillary walls so flavonoids are supposed to strengthen them. I think the Niacinamide has done its part to reduce any sebum I was battling. I had the Alpha Arbutin in my cart too but I didn't want to change too much at once.  Wow. This is all very interesting... 1. I suspect I may be using too much. Is it supposed to feel a slight burning on your skin? 2. I am combining with retinol. I think I will go back to drawing board with all this info. Thanks so much. Apologies to OP for hi jacking post:)  Thanks for this! I‚Äôm having Vitamin C issues now and someone recommended I start with 7-9 drops. Funny how almost none of my products recommend how much to use.  Straw for my wine... omg this solves so many problems  If you're a plastic straw user, try investing in a metal straw set or something like \[this\]\([https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/908228738/finalstraw\-the\-worlds\-first\-collapsible\-reusable\-s](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/908228738/finalstraw-the-worlds-first-collapsible-reusable-s)\)

I'm not trying to judge, just spreading awareness :\) Woah, thanks so much for doing the math! I live in Europe, where it is a bit more expensive I think, but the difference shouldn't be huge. I think it might be a bit too expensive for me right now, but once I've secured a stable job, I might splurge on this.  It's definitely the best jasmine moment I've ever had, in any product.  Secret Key LE and the CosRX are my personal favs. I get them from YesStyle. com  Oh, thank you! Haha, I was kinda scared, I'm very quiet on reddit and thought here comes my first flame :'D

Well, I'm currently going through this stuff all the time either way, so if you are interested I could tell you more in detail. But if you don't I understand, too! Ooohhh, good to know, thank you! Bingo! As bad as it sounds I agree with your original comment for exactly this reason and it seems that a lot of people aren't aware of it  This is true. As a resident of California, we were required to ration water a few summers ago due to drought, but then we found out that residential use of water is actually a small fraction of the water used... most water use is industrial and they weren‚Äôt required to ration at all. It was a little depressing, as we lost $20K of landscaping in our yard due to not being able to water it, while bottled water companies continued bottling water and selling it out of state with no issues. 

It‚Äôs also surprising (at least to me) that eating vegetarian a few meals per week reduces a person‚Äôs carbon footprint more than driving a more fuel-efficient car, as one example. Small, almost unnoticeable changes can make a huge impact, whereas sometimes changes you make that feel pretty painful don‚Äôt help much. It‚Äôs worth researching for sure.  I think I may have to do just that. I haven't had much time today to look, maybe tomorrow üòä  We have pottery barn, unfortunately however, it doesn't look like ours has the mini fridge. 8 may have to just but a different one. Thank you!  I really doubt that Pottery Barn would ever be cheaper than Amazon. Still cheaper than $167.
Hmmm. I wonder if there are different brands.  No worries, we are all here for the love of skincare  üíó NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO to the burning! that's how you know you've been using too much and your skin is mad about it. the absolute MOST you should feel when using it is a bit of an ongoing tingle. And, as I said to another poster down below, my #1 vice is using too much SC product in applications, but even for me - the ultra-slatherer of cold creams - I try to use as little vitamin C as possible.  You can see from my post history I'm not exactly the best expert or believer on "proper amounts" of products, but Vitamin C is one of those things you truly learn the hard way you have to be careful with it and not go overboard, lol. I have flashbacks when I think about how I was so impressed by its initial improving impacts on my skin a year or so ago that I went out and bought not only a vitamin C moisturizer (which for me, personally, is just NOT the way to go - a serum is where I get my C) but also the same brand's vitamin C serum too... **so much blotchy burning**  What is it you're studying?

And yes definitely have more confidence in your English. I live there and you're better than many natives with your writing and I'd assume probably speech too üòÇ

Edit: oh I had no bad intentions just to question and learn, when you do meet the first person that decides to be an asshole...Don't worry about it Thank you! I definitely could have been clearer in my original comment. I think we should all make more responsible and sustainable decisions in our personal lives. Don‚Äôt use plastic bags at the grocery store, buy an electric car, become a vegetarian if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. But unless OP is Scott Pruitt (which would be a wild turn of events) their individual choices are likely to make a negligible impact on the environment and they shouldn‚Äôt be shamed for plugging in a small appliance.  Thanks, those are to really good examples (the meat industry is wildly inefficient from top to bottom). For perspective, I work in a facility that runs 24/7. I‚Äôve seen our energy bills and over the weekend while I‚Äôm not there, they‚Äôll use more electricity then I will use in my apartment all year.  I could unplug everything I own, never use my A/C, and live in the dark and it wouldn‚Äôt come close to offsetting their consumption.  I just checked. It‚Äôs $139 plus 25% off, so yes, cheaper than amazon Canada  ugh. thank you thank you for confirming. I won't give up on vitamin C it but I am taking a break for a few days :) I'm glad :D And thank you very much!

I'm getting trained to become a pharmaceutical technical assistant. So I'm learning a lot about creams and stuff and how they are preserved and what goes with what and what things you have to care about when you work on recipes. I'm from germany, no idea if that's a thing in other parts of the world :'D Where did you check? I couldn't find it listed on PotteryBarn.ca ("mini fridge" & "cooluli" both came up "no hits" - when a company expands to another country, even wholly-owned subsidiaries are distinct corporations, and might have very different product selections). 

Also, on the assumption that you're looking at the US site, currently $139US =$178Cdn. Even at 25% off, they'd not quite be matching Amazon.

Edit: and Canada is a different business environment than the US (eg, higher shipping fees), Pottery Barn Canada being a distinct corporation, and exchange rates fluctuate constantly - I'd be surprised if any company even tried to price things in Canada with any specific tie to the US prices. Homie you are WAY too invested and wrote much too long of a comment for a damn mini fridge. I was simply stating the information I found. PB Teen ships abroad, I‚Äôm not invested enough to calculate all the costs as I‚Äôm not trying to order this nor do I live in Canada. I was simply posting in case it was beneficial to someone. If it doesn‚Äôt work for you, no one is forcing you to buy it. Take a breath.  Then why did you claim to know that PB would be cheaper than Amazon.ca in the first place?

Also, I didn't put much effort into my comment. What is apparently business-school homework to you is just normal price-checking to me.  I saw the price of the PB one, it was cheaper than what the poster said she found on amazon. I didn‚Äôt take in to consideration conversion. Jesus Christ  How do you incorporate the cat into the routine? Cat review please. I, too, use Essence of Gato in my skin routine üòâ Off topic but what a handsome cat! I've tried sooooo many different "routines" and I would go for about 3 or 4 days and then I would just completely fall off the wagon. I'm almost 25 and up until the last month, I have not had a regular skincare routine.

I was at Sephora about a month ago and had some points to redeem so I tried the GlamGlow Glowstarter moisturizer and that's what started it all for me. I started researching cleansers, sunscreens, etc and bought a couple of products off the HG lists and I haven't looked back!

My skin type is normal, I don't have any major concerns, maybe just some hormonal acne and my goal right now is just to find something I can stick with, which is why I chose the cleanser and sunscreen of the HG list. The moisturizer just smells nice and it adds a nice glow, so it's my "treat yo'self" product.

I find the Vanicream and the Cetaphil to be very similar and I think they interchange really well. I bought the Vanicream first because it was at Walgreens, then when I decided I needed a cleanser in my gym bag Walgreens wasn't open yet and Cetaphil was all Walmart had that was close, so I just kind of went with it! All three of these products are great in the sense that you really don't need a lot, so I'm expecting these containers to last me a looooooong time!

**AM Routine:**

Wash: Either Vanicream (pictured) Gentle Facial Cleanser or Cetaphil (not pictured)  Gentle Skin Cleanser. I have the Cetaphil in my gym bag so if I worked out in the morning I use the Cetaphil at the gym

Moisturizer: GlamGlow Glowstarter

Sunscreen: CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 30

**PM Routine:**

Wash: Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser

Moisturizer: GlamGlow Glowstarter

I will begin to expand my routine in the future, but for now, I'm just going to stick with my tried and true!

*\*\* Edited to add more information* Both of the pumps look like they have mini hat-pumps on them and I love it. I knew I needed a softer towel Let me tell you, your fur looks amazing. Never would have thought about incorporating my kitty into my skincare routine without seeing this. Thanks for the idea! That's a lot of blackheads to remove. You might wanna consult your doctor for that Do you use the black thing for exfoliating? This looks like it‚Äôs the cat‚Äôs routine. Haha I too have found drying my face with a black cat at midnight makes me look 5-10 years younger. The vanicream is so crucial. I do vanicream + snail stuff, i don‚Äôt want to jinx it but it feels like it‚Äôs working! I used to use vanicream all the time! Also, your cat looks EXACTLY like mine.... yours may be a bit skinnier though lol Wow! That routine has certainly made your fur so very shiny and sleek! Keep it up! Cat licks are an excellent exfoliant. Careful, people were going mad in here the other day about how cat hair and drool is the devil üòÇ Is you want a plump and puffy eye look, rub cat all over your eyes. I LOVE YOUR CAT I love Vanicream! Best face wash I've ever used. Been using it for over a year now I‚Äôd say the routine is working great, I mean look at that fur sparkling! *posts skincare listed in the FAQ*

Reddit: OmG a cat!!! 100000000 upvotes! I like to dry my face with cats too I need to know what the cato‚Äôs name is üêà As someone who used the Cerave facial lotion with spf I have to say that I found the  Jack Black Double-Duty Face Moisturizer with SPF 20 to go on much smoother without any whitecast at all. Also has vitamin C and E and other great properties. Glam glow smells so good Step 1: place cat on face Nice and simple routine but I won't lie - I came here to gawk at your cute kitty friend. :-) Ah I had a deluxe sample of that glamglow and truly loved it!!! May I ask what your skin type is? Your routine is so simple and lovely. I'm a recovering product junkie and it seems like in all my buying and trying I still haven't nailed any "keeps" yet. Love the Vanicream cleanser! Vanicream is amazing! It's the best cleanser I have ever tried in that it does not dry out my face! I‚Äôm on my second bottle of Vanicream. At first I think I broke out a bit but I‚Äôm ok now. It‚Äôs gentle and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going for. And way cheaper than the Sephora stuff I used. I also add cat to routine. This is cheating! You can't just put the most adorable cat in the image and force me to upvote! KITTY What brand of cat do you recommend? My cat is part of my skincare routine, too. I finish my skincare and then I pick her up and rub my face on her out of love only to activate my allergies and get hair stuck to my moisturized face. I use that Cerave moisturizing lotion / sunscreen in the morning and I absolutely love it, it's my ride or die! Also my name is Brianna too! :) Vanicream crew üëä r/catsinsinks I can tell it's working by the density and shininess of your fur. Congrats on looking great in your mid twenties! Hi there,

Thank you! Just watch out for those cat hairs sticking to your freshly moisturized face. I'm close to running out of my current face moisturizer, (Renewed Hope In A Jar by Philosophy) and was looking at trying the CeraVe moisturizer. It looks like the stuff in the jar and the facial moisturizer \*can\* be both used on the face, but how have you liked your bottle?  None of my friends are into skincare so I've been stalking the subreddit to ask lol Majestic looking kitty & solid minimalist routine.  What's not to love...  Absolute zen How did you choose the best CeraVe product? Im new to this brand and so lost.. Carave makes an awesome under eye cream too. It‚Äôs a firming cream but somehow lightens up the constant dark circles under my eyes. They always look less noticeable when I use it the night before. Aha now I know the secret to fixing my skin. From now on I shall wash my face with a cat every evening until my terrible skin clears up Love Vanicream cleanser ‚ù§Ô∏è I am impressed such a minimal routine can turn you into a cat! You look quite sleek. 

Awesome you have a routine at your age keep it up! Opps, I thought this was for the cat :/ Is the vanicream cleanser sold at drugstores? I would love to try it out 25 is a good age for a cat. You go girl! Kitty! So chonk Can I have your cat? Cats totally just be chilling there like " I approve of this message " lol Well your fur looks great üëçüèΩ That‚Äôs a very cute charcoal mask! *wink wink* Tell us more about these unknown products! How do you get that cerave spf to go on smooth? I got it recently and it pills all over my face then flakes off! You‚Äôre making me want to do same with my cat, if only she was photogenic and if Sephora carried Cheristin/Bravecto/Activyl for cats. idk how people use the cerave sunscreen that stuff is trash when i put it on
leaves me ghostly white and somehow gets chunkier after an hour Upvote for the chonker black only. Very nice. We like it. Very nice. We like it. Is CeraVe AM available in anything bigger than the 3 oz bottle?  I'd love to find a bigger bottle with a pump top. Secret to having flawless skin: black cat magic Great routine and the cat is adorable Cat is amazing!!! Glamglow= oh no ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I love vanicream!!! Is glamglow effective? Do all of them have glitters and stuff like them in them? Can you review the black one? How do I put it on my face. Ha! Looks like my little Callie!üòª What a sweet little house panther!! I love your cat. Lol love the cat‚Äôs pose but are you a crazy cat lady already at 25?? üòÇüòÇ I love Glamglow Glowstarter! Kitty obviously approves of this routine. How on Earth did you manage to get your cat and your products to stay in the same room? 
This one time, I had to keep my kitty in the bathroom so that I could clean his litter box in peace. When I went back to release him, everything, and I mean everything, was on the floor, in the sink, in the bathtub... I've been wanting to try the Vanicream in place of my usual cleanser. Cat helper is an added bonus! Keep at it, because that black coat of fur looks *fabulous* üòã do these products have any specific targets? black cat so fat What does my cat do in your pictures ? It look so the same, calm nice and fluffy black ! I‚Äôm sorry but I can only see an adorable black cat. There is no skincare to be seen in this photo! üêà What‚Äôs my Pepper-boy doing at your place?! Beautiful baby in the back How did a cat type this. It doesn‚Äôt have fingers. Beautiful cheeks omg What a gorgeous little kitty, looks like my babygirlüòä nice You all should watch Dr. Dray on YouTube. She's a dermatologist and gives great advice!! Usually cat lays in sink while cleansing with Vanicream then gets upset when water is turned on Have your cat aggressively rub their face all over yours. Cats are the best kind of face towel because they automatically clean themselves after. One of my cats likes to encourage me by standing on the toilet and yelling at me while I'm doing my skincare routine.  (When she sees me in front of the mirror doing stuff to my face, she thinks I'm going to be leaving for work soon, so she protests loudly!) Only upvoted the post because of the cat. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Essence of Gato is hydrophobic and should not be used in the sink with water running. Essence of Gato desires to be utilized in all sink-related efforts. I prefer Cat 100% serum by the Veterinary, it adds more purr to my skin. Thank you! I will give him extra pets for this comment. What is the cat's skincare routine? I find Vanicream to be much gentler than Cetaphil. I haven‚Äôt had as many problems with my skin drying out since I switched. Missed opportunity to spell it Cat-aphil........


Ok ok I‚Äôll see myself out now [deleted] I had the same experience with routines. Currently I‚Äôm down to a tea tree oil cleansing foam nightly, Stridex in the green box every couple of days, and a gel-cream moisturizer I happened upon at Target (AM and PM). Never been better. Correct if I‚Äôm wrong but shouldn‚Äôt sunscreen go after the moisturizer for max effectiveness? Oh my god I just noticed that.. it lined up perfectly with my hand soap and body lotion! Dermarolling Be careful, it can cause micro tears I‚Äôm not entirely sober, and I first read the title to be referring to the cat‚Äôs age. I thought, ‚Äúwow, that cat looks healthy for 25!‚Äù and then looked down at the products and thought, ‚Äúoh‚Äîshe has a skincare routine. That explains it.‚Äù Which snail stuff? I am a big fan of the Vanicream wash, though I had a bottle start to smell downright rotted after a couple months. What do you use now? I've been thinking about trying a new cleanser since I've used vanicream for so long. An excellent and painful exfoliant. "Um, babycat, can I please keep some of my epidermis?" They are but eeewwwwwww That‚Äôs literally the best explanation one could give for what Reddit is.  But I mean....it‚Äôs a kitty!!!! Ha. Charlie! If it smells it‚Äôs not a good thing. There are only about 5 ingredients specially for scent that will contribute to the health of your skin, the rest are just cancelling out all the work you‚Äôre doing on the best of days. Following! I have acne prone skin and have the vanicream wash, lite lotion and moisturizing lotion. Added stridex pm and vit c am but about a week ago I had a HORRIBLE breakout I'm still recovering from. Might be biotin I was taking (stopped) or possibly the noisturizing lotion is too thick for my skin? Still not sure :( which makes it hard to adjust my routine accordingly üòÇ I added it, does it look okay? üòä One that doesn‚Äôt break you out or leave you feeling greasy basically. Kinda trial and error I get from Target! it used to do that for me as well! I find that if a wait for my face to dry a bit after certain serums or whatever it goes on fine.. but does not work well with make up lol My cat does the same!  Except she tries to get in the water after I finish cleaning Hmm seems like a complicated addition to the routine :) Instructions unclear. Rubbed cat on my face and now it‚Äôs mad. I used to have a cat that did that... needless to say my skin was always glowing! Yep. Same here since I stop smelling like him. For the love of God would someone please get that cat some calendar exposure. He looks like the perfect cat for the month of August. Mine is hydrophilic and takes baths with me. Gotta check with the vet if he's not an otter. Add some more for me! He is a lovely little chonker. He looks exactly like my cat.  Only all the skin care would be on the ground by now. He looks like one of those cats that just washes his face with his saliva soaked paw. The Cetaphil Gentle skin cleanser, or *Daily* skin cleanser?

Cause yeah, I didn‚Äôt realize there were two kinds at first and accidentally bought the daily skin cleanser... Dried me out like crazy! I liked the glam glow moisturizer the first few times I used it, then started to feel like it just made me look gross if I wasn‚Äôt wearing makeup. I like their volcasmic one a lot better ! :) I really like it in fall/spring (for me, too heavy for summer, not heavy enough for winter).  It smells really yummy (kind of like a creamsicle) and If you don‚Äôt use any makeup over it, it‚Äôs a really nice dewy glow. The Korean stuff. I‚Äôll have to look! It‚Äôs like the holy grail of this sub Cosrx Snail Essence is pretty popular Did you keep it in the shower? I had a similar vanicream wash go bad and it was the only time I kept it in the shower. Chalked it up to humidity. I use burt's bees sensitive cotton cleanser, it's a cream formula. I believe it has coconut oil in it, but my skin's ok with coconut oil and hasn't broken out. I haven't heard any other complaints about it, but if you're sensitive to it Idk if it'll work all that well. I actually switched because vanicream was a little drying on my skin, but the Burts bees makes it feel  so nice and smooth! 
I've only been using it for a couple weeks but it makes my skin not dry out after applying tretinoin too! I have a scar that‚Äôs going on 10 years old now from when I was SUPER sick and my cat was licking my arm, I guess trying to comfort me? for a long ass time before I noticed and he had legit taken some layers off üòÖ Charlie is a handsome cat. Do I see necklaces and bracelets hanging on a stand on the countertop!?? Charlie is a good (and beautiful) boy! My kitties could not handle the temptation; jewelry would be everywhere. Your Charlie and my Cooper look like twins! Yeah I hate myself but it smells good man Thank you, your post is back up. :) *now it's shredded. There ya go. Haha Deep exfoliating treatment! Dermatologists hate this one trick! ha ha :) That may be a good idea! Essence of Otter should only be used in combination with water! Preferably while in a large body of it. Lucky...if I did that I would break out so bad. my roommate has the daily and i have the gentle and we both keep them in the shower. you only make the mistake of not looking at the label once.... The gentle one! Yes makes a huge difference since once is soap-free and the other isn‚Äôt. The gentle one is the one to go with. That‚Äôs if you wash your face twice a day. If you wash once a day, a low foam is alright. Interesting. I might give Cetaphil another shot. It never agreed with my skin and I assumed it was that cetaphil has sodium lauryl sulfate and have always avoided products with SLS. Im trying to keep my routine as simple and cheap as possible. Do you have any opinion on their moisturiser? Im a touch on the oily side. 

&#x200B;

Ive always wanted to try Vanicream but it is very expensive and difficult to get in Australia ($100 expedited shipping on Amazon and standard delivery can take up to a month lol) Tell me more... Thanks for the reply! Awww, that's so sweet actually! Yep, your kitty was trying to take care of you. I mean sorry about the scar but that's true kitty love. üòÇüòª Yes there is! Both of my kitties aren't really into the jewelry stand, but when I hang my longer necklaces on the doorknob, that's fair game lol I thought they meant the *cat* was mad, so your correction was horrifying. We prefer the term *exfoliated* here I mean but have you tried?

*The cats held the secret all along!* Oh wow, really?? That makes me really wanna try the vanicream one now.. The moisturizer is quite nice. It‚Äôs of the only ones that my husband will use because it absorbs really quickly and cleanly, and he doesn‚Äôt like scents or the feel of pretty much anything on his face... I like heavier creams, but I use it as an extra layer during winter because I can pat a little on any random time I‚Äôm feeling dry and my skin instantly feels better. 

I‚Äôm in Texas, but travel sizes of both the gentle cleanser and moisturizer are available at most grocery and drug stores here. If you can find them there, it would be a good way to give them a trial run for cheap. I thought it gave me a nice glow the first few time I used it, and was hoping it would look cute when i just wanted to have like a moisturizer and mascara kind of day, but I started to feel like it just made my pores look larger (like how some highlighters can) and made me feel greasy kinda. But I live in FL where it‚Äôs always hot and super humid so that could have played into it. But It did smell amazing

The volcasmic made my skin look glowy yet matte and really seemed to minimize my pores so it was great to wear alone or under makeup, and smelled just as good ! Plus I feel like it didn‚Äôt make me feel greasy even after going outside. I bet! I was considering a jewelry stand, but we just rescued a kitten this month so ....not gonna happen. He's getting our older kitties all playful again which is good, but it's kind of insane here right now. Love em though üò∏ I really didn‚Äôt know what to do either Super deep exfoliation. As with everything else in my life, the first place I look to solve my problems is Reddit, and my acne was no different. ^(That's probably not a good thing, I know...)

At first, I thought I was doomed to try product after product, fraught with trial and error. But after ditching the well-advertised skincare lines and actually obsessing over the science with you guys, I've found something simple and affordable that works for me, and I hope it can work for some of you guys, too. For the record, I have combination/oily-prone skin, and I'm a 16-year-old male.

It's taken me months of research and messing about, but after all, I found that many of the Holy Grail products on this sub are there for a reason. If I had to give one piece of advice to you all, it would be that \*consistency really matters\*. Rather than changing up your entire routine at once, choose one product, research it well, and introduce it regularly. One step towards your perfect routine is well worth it.

Here's my entire routine, done both in the morning and at night. All of these products are easy to get in the US and UK. If you're in the UK like me, you can get this stuff from Amazon (Cetaphil), Boots (BP and CeraVe) and iHerb (Stridex).

1. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (473ml, ¬£7.49) - at first, I didn't think this was doing very much. I was so used to the dry, tight feeling my skin would have when using other cleansers that I almost rejected this product outright. I'm so glad I didn't!
2. Stridex Maximum Salicylic Acid Pads (90 pads, ¬£5.18) - I love these. Unlike so many similar products, these pads are alcohol free. Anything with 'acid' in the name sounds like it's going to be irritating, but this is a lifesaver to soothe irritation, especially in the first few days of your routine.
3. 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Gel (variable cost) - Along with the salicylic acid, this is the workhorse of this routine. I know a lot of people use 2.5%, but I didn't experience much more irritation by using 5% and this was more easily available where I live. The brand doesn't *really* matter here, but this one's great. If you're starting a routine like this, begin with a pea-sized amount once per day, and after a couple of weeks switch to twice per day.
4. CeraVe Moisturising Cream (454g, ¬£14.50) - Now I see what the hype is about. CeraVe "in the blue tub" is incredibly hydrating, but despite the fact it contains petrolatum, it leaves my skin with a matte feeling. I apply it lightly over the other two products to finish off my routine.

In addition to introducing this routine, I found another couple of things incredibly useful. I bought a load of plain pillowcases, and now I swap them out daily. Not only is it helping my skin, but it just feels good. I also used to eat a lot of dairy (Greek yoghurt has been incredibly difficult to go without), but I've switched to soya milk since then. I was surprised by just how much of a difference this made.

Pro-tip for if you accidentally use too much too quickly and end up with a red, dry face: this advice may be controversial, but having 1% hydrocortisone cream on standby is a *massive* help. If your skin is very irritated, apply a tiny amount (a grain of rice) to the most inflamed areas twice per day for two days, and cut out the Stridex and BP until it clears up. You'll be surprised how quickly your face goes from red and burning to presentable and pain-free. Remember to go slower next time.

Thank you to everyone on this sub for helping me reach this point! Congrats on the improvement! I'm glad you've had success. I wonder if there's space in your life for sunscreen though? If you start daily sunscreen at age 16, you'll have a leg up on beautiful skin for life. Hi, just a quick question. 

Is it fine to use Cleanser > Toner > Moisturizer > BP as a spot treatment?

Or should it be Cleanser > Toner > BP as a spot treatment > Moisturizer?

Thanks!! [deleted] I just recommended this to a friend who had no idea where to start.

Edit: I also started my baby sister and her friends off this way.  This is the ultimate starter pack. What did the moisturizer do to your skin in terms of acne? I've heard conflicting opinions, some saying that it'll help acne and some saying it'll make it worse. I have some moisturizer at home but haven't used it in weeks. What was your experience? Am I the only one that cetaphil doesn‚Äôt do shit for? Looks almost exactly like mine! Only difference is that I use the Cerave cleanser. I've tried to add more steps or have a more complicated routine but it seems my face likes simple the best. This is almost exactly my shelf as well! I finally started seeing results after 4 month recently.  Did the BP help with redness, texture and pores? Or just acne?

Btw, well done to you! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôce found a routine that helps!  cetaphil ruined my skin

I had like really mild acne and was told to use cetaphil after a few days my acne broke out like crazy and the only thing that had chaned was the cetaphil.

&#x200B; What a lovely, simple routine! I'm glad it's effective for you!  Holy, i would never and could not use 4 product just to remove some...I should probably though, seems like you and i are pretty similar. 
i would only do these routine in the night when im about to sleep. Tbh  This is good for now due to your age and hormones, but you‚Äôll probably have to change things up as you get older cause both those Salic and benzoyl treatments can really dry your skin. I‚Äôm glad it works for you now, just know your skin won‚Äôt stay like it is forever. Hopefully you‚Äôll just have to stick to a basic cleanse/tone/moisturizer routine. Good luck I just started using those stridex pads about three weeks ago, and it has helped significantly. I‚Äôll post my progress soon.  HOW DID YOU GET A PICTURE OF MY SHELF

This is my exact routine! Old faithfuls from the drugstore. I do an AHA BHA mask once a week too! (Drunk elephant) I use 3/4 of these things, improved my life greatly and cheaper options :)  That's the dream team, right there, except I use Cetaphil lotions and CeraVe cleansers instead!  Cetaphil is SO good!!! My brother struggled with acne all through his teenage years; when I was \~13 I asked him if I could use his huge litre bottle of face wash and he begrudgingly said yes. I have never needed/wanted to use anything else lol. Tip: I once had a small piece of plastic under my eyelid and the optometrist recommended cleaning out my eyes with Cetaphil regularly, too. ALSO you can use it under your arms/in your private areas because it's so gentle but still cleanses effectively. I LOVE THIS SHIT. Do you have a dry skin? Seeing that moisturizer is targeted for dry skin. I've seen it on the counter a few times, but hesitated in buying it, as my skin is a combination of normal and oily. Oooh, Cetaphil works wonders! I swear by it. Acnenide is a blessing and a curse!! Congrats! I used to use acnecide! It bleached so many towels and pillowcases though haha  Where are you from OP and where do you get your stridex from? That cerave tub pisses off my skin so much, but only in the t-zone I find that the few products I use on my face, the clearer it is. I used to load up on all kinds of products, but simplifying it to just a cleanser,  SPF and a light moisturizer make a world of difference. Oh man. Seeing those stridex pads brought back memories of being a teenager. I remember waking up in the morning with so much oil on my face. It took me a bit to realize it was the stridex pads I would use before bed. I‚Äôm glad they work for you, though! Love love love both the cetaphil and cerave. Such solid products!  You have my favorite face wash! I have a question on that, is cerave in the tub suits well with acne-prone skin? thats great!  it seems like your skin is low maintenance too. Lucky you!    When you first started your routine did your skin start to break out before it got better? I switched about 2 weeks ago and I broke out with cystic acne which was worse than it ever was before. But now it's calling down and I'm just left with dark marks.
My routine is vanicream foaming wash, BHA exfoliator, CeraVe Pm twice a day. Recently just introduced vaseline at night.
It's hard to guage if I'm going in the right direction!!! Acnecide saved my life Just used the same cream  I‚Äôm really loving Cerave Nd it‚Äôs because of reddit I found out about it.  I have an almost identical shelf. In addition to this I use Paula's choice  extra care SPF 50, and I swapped the Cetaphil cleanser with the acne.org cleanser.

The acne.org cleanser is really great. It has a lower pH than Cetaphil and doesn't dry my skin out. Plus it's pretty affordable. I use it for face and body. Hey I'm kinda new in trying skin care
and whenever I try to do research, most of it shows a routine of

Cleanser > Toner > Moisturizer

I'm one month in on using Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser

Other than that I'm don't have anything else, like idk what Toner/Moisturizer to buy should I try that routine. 

Can you give an advise to your bro here, thank!  I have to ask: I‚Äôm starting stridex today, and I think it‚Äôll be great for my skin in the long run, but I‚Äôm worried about the purge. Did your skin purge? How long did it last? My routine is a little longer than yours bc I‚Äôm older and I use it as a form of self care, but our routines are super similar! Congrats on finding what works :) Read through up-to-date earlier and apparently, higher concentrations than 2.5% benzoyl peroxide haven't been shown to be more effective against acne.  Nice.  For the BP do you use it as a spot treatment, or apply it to your whole face? Do you put the stridex everywhere, or just as a spot treatment? Congratulations!! That BP is an absolute holy grail it works miracles and I‚Äôm so happy it works for someone else! x Ayyyye. Nice to see someone with a simple routine like myself. 

It's made such a big difference.  Hmm why does your cera ve cream say for dry to very dry , but mine says for normal to dry :( Thank you so much for answering!  I want to try a similar routine, but cetaphil really irritated my skin at first use. I'm scared cerave will do the same too since they seem so similar to me. :(  Congrats! I'm so happy this works for you!

But my super sensitive skin just had a seizure looking at this.  I'm gonna need a link to these products... Cause I'm lazy I‚Äôm nervous to use BP because it dries my face so badly. Even with nice moisturizers my face (especially my chin where most of my acne is) cracks and peels. I also worry about it bleaching my linens and towels.  For any Canadians out there, I found all this stuff for a good price at shoppers:

edit: [I decided to copy OP and just buy it.](https://i.imgur.com/e7qbyul.jpg)
 where did you get the stridex pads for ¬£5.18 ??‚ò∫Ô∏è How often do you use the stridex pads, and when? Lol all hail cetophil! Been using for 20+ years and would never stop Doesn‚Äòt your skin react to the two alcohols in the moisturizer? I second the sunscreen! I‚Äôm 21 and just starting to use sunscreen daily, I wish I started sooner üò£ All the good sunscreens I'd heard about were too expensive for me. There's a Cetaphil Daily Moisturiser with SPF, but I didn't react well to it. Do you have any specific recommendations? [The use of daily sunscreen is debated a bit on /r/SkincareAddictionUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/a2j461/do_you_use_sunscreen_every_day_in_the_uk/) - we tend to have very low UV levels in the winter, and very little sunlight as well. I use a Cetaphil SPF 15 face moisturizer. Is that close enough?  [deleted] Seconding this suggestion, OP get on the SPF bandwagon YOU'LL LOOK YOUNG FOREVER. I'd use BP before moisturiser. Moisturisers, especially the emollient type, can form a barrier that stop active ingredients from entering your skin. Why are you using a toner (what is it‚Äôs purpose in your routing)? Mo money mo problems Thanks! I've found that the simpler a routine is, the easier it is to do consistently. I can imagine that using something barebones like this improves your chances of success, but from time to time I'm jealous of the overfilled shelfies on here with loads of expensive products. Good luck to them! It really is. There needs to be a PSA. Every teenager needs this routine! Moisturiser is really important, since it's not really possible to use benzoyl peroxide -- the main acne-fighting ingredient -- without it. If your skin is well-hydrated, it produces less oil, which causes fewer acne-causing bacteria to grow. Make sure you use a good moisturiser, preferably one with SPF. You'll find rave reviews about the CeraVe one. BP is drying. Why would moisturizer be bad for acne prone skin? Nope same here Cetaphil broke me out and left me with horrid pigmentation. I avoid at all costs.  It actually stung my face the first time I used it so it‚Äôs definitely not for me. I like the neutrogena ultra gentle foaming facial cleanser instead, it‚Äôs my HG face wash.  Cetaphil makes my skin break out REALLY bad. I really wish it worked  I don't like it. Cerave cleanser and moisturizer all the way for me Saaame. Also my skin HATES Cerave :( sucks being on the fringe of these cult products! To understand the effects of BP and salicylic acid, it's useful to understand how they work.

Acne is caused primarily by the P. *acnes* bacterium. It lives on your face and in your pores, consuming sebum (skin oil), and producing various toxins which irritate your skin and form pimples.

Benzoyl peroxide works by killing the P. *acnes* bacterium, by releasing oxygen, like other peroxides. In the short-term, it actually contributes to redness and irritation, but once your skin adjusts, the reduced levels of bacteria improve your skin's texture. Good formulations of BP will also reduce the amount of oil your skin produces, improving texture and reducing pore size.

Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid which works like an exfoliator. Specifically, it dissolves the 'glue' that stick your skin cells together and contribute to acne. Salicylic acid in particular is an anti-inflammatory agent: it is very similar to aspirin (a.k.a. acetylsalicylic acid). As a result, it is good at immediately reducing redness and removing dead skin.

Using SA and BP together allows the BP to penetrate deeper into pores than it usually would, enhancing its ability to reduce irritation and improve skin texture.

If you're looking for something that will improve your skin texture in general, retinoids like tretinoin (Retin-A) are the holy grail. I've also heard good things about niacinamide and AHAs (alpha-hydroxy acids) like glycolic acid, which forms part of the [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) routine. BP is just for acne, not recommended if you are not prone to breakouts, or actively breaking out.

1-3% BP daily treatment is especially helpful for teenagers
10% BP for spot treatments (a pimple), under hydrocolloid Any changes to your routine are likely to aggravate acne. Consistency is key: using bad products consistently can be better than using good products infrequently. Regardless, I find that Cetaphil works for me. All the scaremongering about parabens isn't important, in my opinion. Me too! While a good amount of people love this product, it‚Äôs also pretty common to have issues with it! It contains propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, and the three parabens. Some people react very poorly to some of those ingredients, you and me being two of them. If you‚Äôre looking for something similar (a cleanser that doesn‚Äôt dry you out but is still gentle) I recommend the cerave hydrating cleanser. I'm hoping that one day I won't need the BP and SA, but I can say that the SA really isn't drying. With a good moisturiser like this, I don't have any dryness issues at all.

I've heard that retinoids are great for improving your complexion, especially with age, but I don't want to go through the retinisation period at this point, especially when my skin has only just got better. Thanks for your advice! I don't, but I think that's just what the moisturiser's target audience is. Using benzoyl peroxide makes your skin *really* dry and irritated unless you moisturise properly.

Edit: my skin is also combination/oily, too. I find my skin produces less oil when it's well-hydrated due to the lower irritation. I'm from the UK, but I get mine from iHerb, which is a US site that ships overseas. Delivery is about ¬£6 and you have to order under ¬£15, otherwise you pay import tax/VAT. Yep, it works great for me. If you're using benzoyl peroxide, the most common acne treatment, you will *need* a good moisturiser like this one. My skin got worse/stayed the same for about two weeks. After six weeks it was clearly better, and by eight weeks I'm clear! (apart from one whitehead in my hairline, but it's an improvement from like 30)

It sounds like your routine is great. Adding more moisturiser can't hurt, especially with something as mild as Vaseline. Sounds like you're going in the right direction, and you're making progress at about what you should expect! Good luck  Toner is unnecessary, but moisturizer is, so definitely add one in. After that, sunscreen in the AM and you‚Äôre set! Around this sub, you'll see plenty of recommendations for the CeraVe Moisturising Cream (the one in the blue tub in this image). It's low-cost, but it contains many ingredients which are usually considered 'premium'.

Toners aren't always necessary, but in general they refer to ingredients which reduce the amount of oil your skin produces. Many of them contain witch hazel, which is a good astringent. I don't have any specific recommendations, but you should look for one without alcohol. Thayers Witch Hazel Toner has been a great option for me. It‚Äôs works really nicely on my skin, paired with the Cetaphil cleanser The witch hazel is an astringent that‚Äôs food for shrinking pores, but it can be drying. You can buy Thayer‚Äôs toners to try. If your skin is peeling then try a toner that doesn‚Äôt have alcohol or witch hazel (and really check to make sure it doesn‚Äôt have any amount of alcohol). Try Rose Water spray for a toner. For moisturizer, I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out myself (combination/sort of dry acne prone skin here).  

Neutrogena oil free cream (or water gel if you feel you don‚Äôt need that much moisture) is good if you feel oily and acne prone. You can also try that grape fruit, oil free saylic acid (there‚Äôs an off brand and nuetrogena one). You‚Äôd have to see how your skin reacts to it over a week or two (if you have an immediate reaction then take it back). Some people ingredients or fragrance might not agree with your skin, so keep the receipts for some weeks to make sure you like it. You don't really get much purging with the SA. It increases the turnover of your skin cells, but it also reduces irritation. It's nothing like what you would expect from retinoids.

Benzoyl peroxide, on the other hand, might dry your skin and possibly break you out in the short term. I can't find any 2.5% where I live.

In the UK, benzoyl peroxide is behind the counter, so you have to speak to a pharmacist and answer some questions before you can get it. As a result, they only really carry one brand. I apply it everywhere, but some people use benzoyl peroxide 10% as a spot treatment, and others use 2.5/5% as a mask in the bath and wash it off afterwards. What I do is probably the most common. Yep, everywhere. In the tub there are 90 moist pads. I use it everywhere, wait for it to dry, then apply benzoyl peroxide and moisturiser. Make sure you have the moisturising cream (blue tub) rather than the lotion (green tub). The UK version is also different to the US version: the UK one is vegan, but the US one isn't (contains lanolin from sheep). Otherwise, I'd imagine they're pretty similar. CeraVe is great on my skin, Cetaphil not so much. There are only four products, they're really easy to find in drug stores/online. The best places to find them wil depend on where you are in the world. If you're in the UK, Boots has most of this stuff, apart from the Stridex (which I get from iHerb). One great solution to both of these problems is BP contact therapy. You put it on for 5 minutes, then wash it off. Check out Simple Skincare Science's blog about this. It works great for me! The important thing is to start very slowly (just a smear once per day or every other day), and work your way up. It took me a couple of weeks to be able to tolerate what you would call a "normal" amount of BP.

Regarding the bleaching issue, I avoided that by using white pillowcases, but there are few times where I haven't been careful, and I haven't run into any issues. Your mileage might vary, however.

Have you got anything to work? Starting tretinoin is even more hellish than BP, in my experience. Neutrogena has a leave-on BP mask that's only 2.5%! I also have problems with dryness and flakiness with BP but this one has never given me problems and I've been using it pretty much nightly for the last couple of months. I leave it on overnight and then use it to spot-treat in the morning but it seems like it would be pretty good for the short-contact therapy that others have mentioned. It's part of their Rapid Clear line and it comes in a little red and white tube. I am currently using BP contact therapy and it is working effectively. I only use it every second day, and I find that every second day works just as it does when I use it twice a day. [deleted] is the BP wash better than the gel Benzagel have? iHerb. It's an American site that ships internationally, but shipping costs like ¬£6 and it's usually out of stock (so set a notification). I think you need to spend under ¬£15 too, otherwise there's an import tax. It's still well worth getting them from there if you can. Twice per day, before applying the benzoyl peroxide. 37 here. Just started as well. You are doing great don‚Äôt worry. Not OP but with a similar shelf except I use an spf moisturiser! I was wondering if that was sufficient? Or if a dedicated sunscreen is preferable/needed? Thanks !  [deleted] Also if you order Biore Watery Essence on Amazon it‚Äôs a pretty cheap standalone one. I love using Asian chemical sunscreens, because they tend to be lighter on the skin and don't leave a white cast. YMMV though, I know that some people are sensitive, so do some research! As suggested, Biore Watery Essence is good beginner sunscreen. My HG is the Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk; it's really hydrating and gives me that radiant glow-from-within, it doesn't have any fragrance, and is thin and easy to use. I'd check r/asianbeauty to find sellers! I got mine off Amazon for less than $10 :) You could try CerraVe AM Neutrogena has a fairly inexpensive sunscreen Clear Face I highly recommend Korean/japanese sunscreens! They are totally different from anything else and you can't even feel they are there 
I really like skin aqua ultra moisture milk, it's on Amazon
Check out the Asian beauty subreddit and you'll be able to get some great recommendations on sunscreens you'll actually enjoy using! Ugh, I was SO disappointed by Cetaphil when I bought that product! Its such a blugh product and I have a hard time believing anybody has that great of a reaction to it.

Still, a lackluster sunscreen is better than nothing, so you need to hustle and find something that you can make do with while you look for your cinderella spf product.

I second the Biore watery essence. Its a game changer! Its a gel formula and it goes on really light and smooth with this nice citrusy smell. Its SO different than what I think of when I think sunscreen.

I'm also a fan of Aveeno protect and hydrate. Its by no means a holy grail, but its a solid B- sunscreen. Its my "this will do until I get something better" sunscreen that I always keep 1 bottle of in the back of my bathroom drawer as a backup. Its the least greasy of the affordable drugstore sunscreens (WAY less greasy than the Cetaphil) and it doesn't irritate my skin (and my skin is a real diva who finds an excuse to get irritated by just about everything- especially sunscreen). My *only* complaint is that if I get hot & sweaty, it seems to ooze right back out of my poors. So when I was waiting at a bus stop on a super humid August day, I was frantically dabbing my forehead more than a tv preacher. Its not the end of the world for something like running errands or going to work, but was a dealbreaker for those days I was trying to look adorable in a sundress  I dont want to be offensive, but isnt the low sunlight somewhat counteracted by the genetic predisposition towards fair skin (for the people whose ancestry is from the UK)? In the US its a pretty ling running joke that people who are ethnically Irish/British/Scottish (America doesn't really seem to be aware of Wales existence) are super fair skinned and ill suited to sun exposure. One branch of my family is entirely Irish and there's so much skin cancer, benign moles, and faces so freckled that if you squinted it might pass as a tan. 

I live in Minnesota which gets pretty minimal sunlight in the winter and I wear a scarf over my face most of the time anyway. I still somehow got a new mole and 2 new freckles on my face since November. I'm obviously not getting sunburns so I was telling myself that I wasn't getting much skin damage, but clearly that whole 'sunlight reflects off snow' bit is more true than I like to admit.

I dont exactly live in California with their level of UV exposure. But I also have to keep in mind that I also do not have Guatemalan or Nigerian or Italian skin and that my skin has a much lower tolerance for sun exposure than the majority of people know The UV index measures UVB. UVA penetrates cloud cover easily. This is the type of UV that contributes to accelerated aging and hyperpigmentation and many other skin concerns.  No, you shouldnt use tanning oil. Tans *are* sun damage, so trying to amplify a tan while trying to block UV light doesn't make sense. Its like taking medicine for constipation and diarrhea at the same time (sorry, GROSS example but its the only thing I could think of) One of the byproducts of using sunscreen is that you will tan less as a result. Thats why you sometimes see pictures of people where their skintone on their face is significantly lighter than on their body. 

If you're trying to minimize sun damage, you're gonna have to start fake baking. Its not as satisfying as a real tan, but the sacrifice pays off tenfold a decade or two out. The tan will fade but the more permanent forms of sun damage will linger. 

 A good sunless tanner is cheaper than melanoma treatment. [deleted] Ohhh, didn‚Äôt realize that. Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Where should sunscreen fit in that lineup?  Well, it‚Äôs just to make sure there‚Äôs not much dirt left on my face after using my cleanser. Do you suggest I skip it out? Much better than the "try common household items that a friend shared on [Facebook/Pintrest/Tumblr] and end up scaring yourself" routine.  Yeah, I meant to pick up CeraVe in the tub a while ago but accidentally got the lotion (the one in the bottle). I just happened to be at Walgreens when reading this so if they have the tub here I'll pick it up. Do you use it in the morning and evening, and how much do you use? I switched to Cetaphil for one week and I had giant red pimples break out immediately. Maybe there was an adjustment period but I didn't want to find out so I bought my old one. It dries out my skin like crazy. It‚Äôs literally breaks my skin open.  I‚Äôll have to look into that. Thank you!  Great explanation  Would using SA and AHAs be too much exfoliating? Weren't there studies showing that 2.5% BP had the same effectiveness as 10%? I'm on mobile right now but I remember seeing that on this sub before Retinoids can, but I‚Äôd see a dermatologist before ever deciding you need that (it‚Äôs definitely your choice now that there are some non-prescription retinoids out there) . I‚Äôd say for those with really bad acne due to some skin condition or something (I‚Äôve seen some people with gnarly acne into their 40s trying to recover). But for some teenage acne that‚Äôll be temporary (or mild acne like I‚Äôve had) I‚Äôd try to avoid it. It‚Äôs not bad stuff cause it works (I did try it for a little bit) , but it can be a little intense on your skin. I‚Äôm thrilled for you cause I know how good it feels when you find things that work!  I understand, i'm using differin and i really wanted to like cerave in the tub but i felt like it gaved me bumps and a couple little pimples. i did patch test the cerave moisturizing lotion too and it didn't break me out. For 1 week now i'm using on my whole face and so far i like it. But i wish i can use cerave in the tub too. Thank you!! I started this routine after I found simple skincare science and it really is a marathon, thank you!! Hope I'm as clear by week six as you were!! I still don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs continued obsession with toner... This is also why said people complain of very oily skin. Looks like I'll be buying that Moisturizer! 

Since I do have dry skin and have these large pores, do you think I should try a using a toner?  Rose Water Spray was also suggested, guess I'll try which of the two is available in my country üòÇ

 tyvm kind strangers  Since I do have dry skin and have these large pores, do you think I should try a using a toner?  Common problems:

Your pores do not change size. You just remover buildup/ excess skin to make them less noticeable; or you use pore strips and make them more noticeable bc they are now open to be filled with bacteria loving crap.

Taking oil from oily skin is just making it worse. Your skin is producing excessive oil for two reasons: hormones, and you are lacking on oil to the skin so the skin is overcompensating (homeostasis.  Try over oiling your skin at night, in the mornings use lighter oil based products. Over time your skin will need to produce less. The hormones will still make things uneven, but much more manageable.   Mine is blue as well. hmm maybe the uk one is better
 Seconding this, works so well for me without any resulting dryness. I use a 10% cleanser, let it sit on my face for 15 minutes, and then wash it off. Works just as well! I never knew that was a thing!!! Good suggestion! What a good idea! BP bleaches hair and clothes for me Hmm, I think they probably are different products but I've never bought CereVe before so I don't really know what I'm talking about.  The Benzagel gel and the BP wash are [one in the same](https://beauty.shoppersdrugmart.ca/Beauty/Categories/Skin-Care/Acne/Acne-Gel/p/BB_851722000744?variantCode=851722000744) unless I'm misunderstanding something.  A moisturizer with SPF should be ok, I don't know why it wouldn't be.  Perfectly fine if you apply enough of it and make sure to reapply every 2h of sun exposure. If it‚Äôs an avonbenzone-based sunscreen, this is especially important, as this ingredient degrades quickly and you lose the protection. Are you a doctor? Because the concensus not only amongdermarologists but among general practitioners is that people should focus on gut absortpion if theyre worried about vitamin d not skin exposure.

Its entirely possible once upon a time that sun exposure would have been more beneficial than sunscreen use. That has not been the case since we've begun studying UV exposure in a post-compromised ozone layer world. The risks of skin cancer vary by genetics and geographic location, but generally for the majority of people there's no doubt in the medical community that unprotected sun exposure should be kept to a minimum.  You should always put sunscreen on your face. You can get plenty of vitamin D from exposed skin elsewhere on your body in about 10 minutes during the summer months. After 10 minutes, sunscreen on all exposed skin. 

During the winter months, you‚Äôre not generating any vitamin D, so there‚Äôs no reason not to put sunscreen everywhere. Damaging UV rays still penetrate the atmosphere.  Seconding this, the biore watery essence is so incredible. SPF50, no sheen, no white cast, and makes my skin feel so nice. My HG sunscreen.  The thing is that we don't get snow in most of the UK, except for the highlands of Scotland. We maybe have one or two days of having snow on the ground a year - and we're also still on a higher latitude than Minnesota. Most people also aren't as fair skinned as the traditional Irish or Scottish skin, in England at least most White British have the same skin shade as those from France or whatever. In the winter the UV index is usually between 0 and 1, so pretty low, and lots of people also barely see the sun at the height of winter as it finishes rising after going to work and has started to set before you leave. Sure, but even in a sunny day the UV index is low in the UK in the winter. I don't think that user is talking about self tanner. They are talking about pills you wear before tanning which make you tan faster and darker. It is not healthy to use those oils, as you still get sun damage  At the end, usually. The days are short in the UK at the moment; I'll introduce sunscreen in early spring, probably. Sunscreen should go on after moisturizer.  Toners apparently help balance the ph of your skin. There are also hydrating toners (like Hada Labo) that also make your moisturizer or other products absorb better. So maybe you don't have to skip it? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Not sure whether they are actually necessary, but I did find that my skin felt much more hydrated when I applied moisturizer on damp skin rather than dry skin.  Yep. I cleanse, then apply SA, then apply BP, then moisturise, twice per day. You'll be able to judge the right amount: not enough to be shiny, but just enough to completely cover your face.

I'm not familiar with US coins, but I think it would be a glob about the size of a dime, or enough to half-cover your index finger. They have the same ingredients - the big difference is the fact that one is more of a 'cream' consistency and the other is more of a 'lotion' consistency, it's all up to you for preference really. 

Plus, the pump (which you should get for the tub one either way), is more hygienic than digging your fingers into a tub everyday 

I use the lotion one and use it in the morning, and in the evening after cleansing and toning... I also use a lot of thin layers when applying, since it's a thinner consistency. My skin is combination - dry alllll around my chin and cheeks and CeraVe does a wonderful job

edit: the tub one has petrolatum sorry, whereas the lotion pump one does not, sorry

check [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3ir4zg/review_quick_guide_to_different_cerave/) for some useful information and the ingredient list Omg me too! It irritated my skin so bad. My skin felt like it was on fire for days.  :(  yeah... It's too much. Overexfoliation can lead to acne. Use one or another once or maximum twice a week Not everything works for everyone. If CeraVe had given me a few bumps/pimples, I probably wouldn't have noticed it since my skin was so bad already, so maybe CeraVe takes a while for your skin to adjust to. I don't have much experience with toners, but since the ingredients (e.g. witch hazel) are astringents, they're supposed to decrease pore size and the amount of oil your skin produces. The drying effect might not be a good thing if you have dry skin, but using a good moisturiser like that one should help. I don‚Äôt think it would hurt to try, I would just avoid astringents like alcohol or witch hazel. Toners can help hydrate, remove any soap you might of not got odd with water, brighten or exfoliate/cleanse depending on which one you get. Most people say a basic skin care routine should include a cleanse, tone, and moisturize routine. But everyone‚Äôs skin has different needs. Even if you do see a dermatologist or esthetician you‚Äôll probably go through some trial and error of products to find what feels good. When you do try something, do it for a few weeks (unless you notice immediate reactions/bumps,itchiness ect.) and keep the receipt if you feel it isn‚Äôt working out. The oil free options shouldn‚Äôt remove oil. The misconception is people think pores open or close, but they are always open. Size is based on genetics, but they can increase or decrease slightly based on what you do to them. Removing oil from your face is bad, true. Adding more can be good, but for someone like me it just breaks me out so it might not be the solution for everyone. What's this 10% cleanser called? 10% sounds strong. I have a 5% face wash A study found out that moisturizers with SPF are less effective than sunscreens with the same SPF.

https://lantsandlaminins.com/about/can-you-replace-your-sunscreen-with-spf-containing-moisturisers/

It is not much to go on tho. Moisturizers do provide some protection, just not as much as suggested by the SPF value. Would be nice if another study could quantify it.  I have a moisturizer with spf 30 and in tje back it says that it shouldn't be used as sunscreen How do you do this with wearing makeup? If you use a cleanser with the proper pH you wouldn‚Äôt have to. Also, toners usually don‚Äôt have the right pH to get your skin back down.

Try a hydrating serum instead of a useless toner. Thank you.  Yeah your right its ymmv.  There is always a chance maybe i was wrong. I want to patch test later when i have clearer skin I use the equate brand and it works well for me (and it's like 4$ at Walmart). 10% is a bit high when I leave it on my skin overnight, but in a cleanser which I only leave on for 15ish minutes, it's not irritating. I don't have particularly sensitive skin though, so YMMV What the heck is the point then? This is so weird. That‚Äôs a bit tricky. Powders with SPF, SPF sprays - not ideal, but better than nothing. A sunscreen with more stable ingredients would give better starting odds. If you‚Äôre in the States, look for a mineral based sunscreen like Australian Gold, Paula‚Äôs Choice or Elta MD. European and Asian sunscreens are excellent too.

Also avoid sun exposure if you can‚Äôt reapply, use sun protective clothing. Tinted sunscreen with a beauty blender or disposable sponge  The funny thing is i was thinking about that 2 days ago. I decided to see if it's protection from the sun was good but the bottle itself says it isn't a sunscreen. Weird. They probably mean that it would be enough protection on a daily basis but that you can‚Äôt use it as a replacement for actual sunscreen when, for example, you‚Äôre going to the beach This reminds me of the opening scene of American Psycho im a skincare newbie and holy shit this looks expensive D: Aztec clay is the shiiit I just got Neutrogena Hydro Boost and jfc why did no one warn me that it smells like a YMCA pool Newbie here too.

I‚Äôm curious about the point of having different face foams etc aside from cleansers?

Literally all I have is cleanser, tonic, and moisturizer [deleted] Thats a lot of fuckin money This is random but how did you edit/take this picture? I‚Äôve been trying to figure out how to take nice pictures of my shelf! Yours is beautiful! do you apply the neutrogena moisturizer mixed with rosehip oil while your skin is wet? First time I‚Äôve ever seen ZO products on this sub! I use the Daily Power Defense and their face wash and I LOVE THEM I feel like this is way overkill. My skin would be a disaster if I used that many products. I'm glad it works for you though! You probably don't need most of this stuff. I used to spend a fortune on skincare. Very high end skin care only available at the Dr. Then I started watching Dr Dray on YouTube and really reduced what I was using and have been happy with the results. what sort of skin do you have?

edit - sorry i‚Äôm dumb just scrolled down and saw lol This just seems so excessive to me. I‚Äôm happy it works for you, but I can‚Äôt imagine putting this much stuff on my face. I don't know what all that other junk is. All you need is the bottom row. 24/F - I have combo skin- overall very dry, but I get hormonal acne on my jawline and chin. I have somewhat sensitive skin and am prone to redness and irritation. I also like to address some discoloration from past acne and use anti-aging products for preventative purposes.

Their Advanced Radical Night Repair Cream and Growth Factor Serum has done wonders for my skin. Seriously one of the best brands I‚Äôve tried for myself! Ooh such a pretty collection of products! But I thought makeup remover wipes were bad for your skin? I use micellar water and cotton pads. Also, MB is very loaded with fragrance and weird colors. Love the Ordinary tho!! .... Konmari Benton‚Äôs high content snail bee essence, can confirm that shit is indeed magical. Do you have a list of things on your shelf? I was actually going to comment that you must work at a PS or Derm office because the ZO and Skin Medica are $$$$$ Valmont creams are legit pointless. My mother uses a few things from that brand and i swear all they have in them is irritants and emollients. Absolutely nothing that justifies the price. Neutrogena Hydro Boost contains too much silicones. My face‚Äôs full of pimples every single time I used it, and smell so strong as well. After the third try, I totally gave up and gave it away! How do you use all these products?? Could you break it down for a newbie like myself?? Holy shit I‚Äôm so sorry it takes soooooo much to have nice skin. Posts like this overwhelm me so much I don't even do anything beyond evening lotion. Has anyone had any bad side effects with retinol ? LOVE Zo! Everything is so nicely organised What is THE #1 thing out of your collection that you would first recommend to someone wanting to gain this clout? Do you by chance live in Cali? That Releaf Balm you got there is a lifesaver and basically my crack.  Kinda outa luck over here on east coast though! [this is such a shill post... considering 6 months ago you tried this with completely different brands... ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/auhc61/happiest_place_on_earth_brands_included_curology/) I totally get you work at the office but since when is a plastic surgeon the go to for basic skincare? this belongs on IG not here Funny seeing this while having that same indian clay on pulled off my face 10 minutes ago haha. Stuff is magic This seems hella excessive. Just looking at this pic irritated my skin lol what‚Äôs ur zodiac sign?? lol ur pic looks so aesthetically pleasing Happy to see Neutrogena Hydro Boost! It's such an underrated moisturizer. It's one of the very few moisturizers that hasn't broken me out. Loving your collection! Do you like the cellcosmet?  Are you in the states?    It's sooooooo expensive here Are there any products you would do without? Or what would your top 5-10 products be for someone looking in a budget? Thx for sharing!! I am jealous about the Cellcosmet! I received a sample of the cellcosmet CellLift in a little glass jar and I tried it once and was amazed at how well it worked! It was like a beauty filter on a picture but IRL. So I have not used it again, because I am saving it for a special occasion. It has a good amount for a sample. I spent under $20 and recieved 3 high end samples. It was from a site called olivela. My dermatologist recommended the Obagi brand today. Yep, it‚Äôs just simply what works for me. The change in my blackheads, redness, and acne scaring is amazing. And for the first time in years I‚Äôm comfortable without make up on. Honestly, it‚Äôs made me way more glowy. I still get some hormonal chin acne. I have a derm and an aesthetician but the aesthetician was really key in customizing a plan for me. My moisture barrier has healed too. I think what seems aggressive for one person, is just what works for another ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è you shold really try cream'ove'sumyun'gai For sure, I‚Äôm in my thirties and I still haven‚Äôt figured my crappy skin out. Very happy for your clear skin, rock on! I‚Äôm really into skincare but have just recently been trying to understand the ingredients and products I‚Äôm putting on my face.  I‚Äôve been trying to add and expand my current routine and I wanted to ask how you juggle all of these products and how you know what to keep track of. Overall I‚Äôve been finding it overwhelming as some products can cause a reaction when used together or others are best either in the morning or at night. Ive also found that I love that Neutrogena water gel, but now have seen some people mention that it‚Äôs best if used right after washing your face. Whiiiiich then made me wonder about toner? Sorry for the long question. Any feedback helps! Can you mix AHA BHA cleansers with Aloe Vera? Does curology really work? We are broke, don't do this to us üò≠ I bought azetc clay I don't see the results yet can u tell me what should i expect! From it So you use all of these products daily? The lighting on this is so good I thought it was a damn painting at first lol I see so many products I love here! That Aztec Secret clay mask is the end-all be-all clay mask! I use it alone, or mix in a little dead sea salt or matcha. It makes my skin so perfectly smooth and breakout free. Also rosewater spray is better than any toner I've ever tried. It's vitamin C laden which I think makes my skin more even toned. Of course Rosehip oil is my go-to and sometimes only skin oil and I will never stop loving it! Thanks for sharing! Hi! Do you think valmont is worth it for the price? Really thinking about splurging on the Prime Renewing Pack..! I thought it was a picture out of an *Allure* or *Self* article. Your shelfie looks amaing :O Hey what type of acne do you get? Is it just the standard or cc or cysts? 

I‚Äôve got CC all over my face so wondering if any of these will help. 

How did you find the following helped your skin: 
- Indian clay mask 
- MB healing mask 
- niacinamide How do you feel about the neutrogena hydro boost line? I‚Äôve been wanting to try it, especially since my skin is dry but I still get acne from time to
time. I‚Äôve heard great things about the products What‚Äôs your everyday routine newbie here with some intense acne any advice. Does anyone know if the Ordinary's BHA has a similar texture/viscosity of their niacinamide/zinc? I picked up the niacinamide/zinc from the Ulta a few weeks ago and really like. Just having a hard time find the BHA in stores so I went with Paula's Choice since you can get it fast via Amazon. This shelf just called me broke üíÄ I have like 5 things, I think I'm doing skin care wrong... Goals Wow- lots of drama here and like another said- keyboard dermatologists. Haha! If this is what works for them- there's nothing wrong with it. I started with MB 2% glycolic toner and my skin loves it. Acne prone and sensitive, never had an issue. My skin can't handle physical exfoliation so daily acids at a low level works great for me. I'll probably never stop using it. It's one of my staples. just used the aztec clay for the first time ever This is such a beautifully organized cabinet! I can‚Äôt imagine anyone puts this much product on their face.  I‚Äôm mesmerized by the whole skincare addiction and the billion dollar industry. [deleted] Lots a chemicals i seeeeee this shelf is beautiful. thank you ! My broke ass is jealous How dof you take the photohgraph? I'm obsessed with this kind of aesthetic! underrated comment right here I feel you!! Luckily I worked at a plastic surgeon‚Äôs office and got great discounts on products or I wouldn‚Äôt have quite the collection! I‚Äôd start out with The Ordinary and Mario Badescu which have amazing products at good prices. Don't fret. You mostly need to wash your face and use a mineral sunscreen if you're going to be outside more than 15 minutes. Mostly. Lots of drama here. 

The things that make the most difference after that only come with a prescription or genetics. AND SO CHEAP It's amazing how much it improves my skin! I love the Aztec Clay Mask, and will never be without it. I was also bamboozled by the scented hydro boost - triggered my scent allergies too :( Really? I keep getting it because I LOVE the ocean-esque smell. Reminds me of Sunday Riley‚Äôs Tidal moisturizer. It smells like that blue porta potty water to me. There's an unscented version, unless that's what you're referring to Yum,  nothing like slapping some chlorine and urine on your face in the morning and night. Try the hado labo kind You need to get the gel cream! I was lucky and bought the gel cream and absolutely loved it. I have heard the water gel smells and doesn't work as well. Plus the water gel has dye and fragrance. The gel cream is meant for people with extra dry skin, and I have oily skin and it worked great on my skin. It's too bad they have fragrance and dye in the water gel. Omg I‚Äôve never noticed that but now I‚Äôll smell it every time! Skinceuticals C E Ferulic is supposed to be AMAZING and I wore it precisely one time bc it smelled like I was rubbing dead animal skin on my face ü§¢ I thought it smelled like cheap laundry detergent. But like you stuffed the bottle up your nose...15 It reminds me of Pert Plus. Smells like formaldehyde to me. The first time I got this (from target) it smelled great, then when I got it from amazon it smelled like a pool. I thought maybe it was a fake? Add a sunscreen and you're golden! That‚Äôs literally all you need. Of course there are products for specific issues, but most of the time a 12 step routine isn‚Äôt necessary. It‚Äôs good to have a simple skincare routine, using only products that your skin truly needs. Using so many different things can overwhelm your skin and makes it difficult to pinpoint any product related issues. If your three products work for you then stick to it! There‚Äôs literally no other reason but to post pictures on this sub lol. You don‚Äôt need anything else aside from what you‚Äôre already using. Maybe add a sunscreen if you‚Äôre prone to burning. Most things seen on this sub are hella excessive. I immediately just assumed OP was pushing these products for their place of work. #ad. Lol. 


But yes, Tretinoin and sunscreen. Period. It's almost as if the op works somewhere that sells the products I checked the ingredients on some of their products. Just... YIKES. I do not think that word means what you think it means. *Application * of sunscreen is the correct term. The founder‚Äôs dad is a famous Swiss scientist that created the technique to stabilize live cells instead of flash freezing them. This means the cells can be kept in a healthy, active state for months. They are the only skincare brand that uses this technique. You can learn about why this important or link to some of their clinical studies on their website.

So yeah.. maybe read about it first. Way overkill. Thank you!! My bf is a photographer so I used his nice camera and turned up the exposure in Light Room. Then I used Facetune to whiten the shelves a bit and being out the detail of the product names! I wait for the previous products to sit for a while before doing the Neutrogena and Rosehip oil mix. Tbh I‚Äôm not sure if mixing them makes it better but I‚Äôve been doing it a while and really like the results! 

EDIT: The reason I do it is I feel like if I use the oil first, the gel won‚Äôt penetrate as well, and vice versa. Maybe an expert in this thread can shed some light üòÑ I‚Äôm so happy to find someone who uses their products!! They‚Äôre AMAZING. The Hydrating Cleanser is to die for. Im so happy to see ZO in here as well! My mom has recently become the ZO distributor in my country and the reception among clinics and clients is overwhelming. DPD, pads, pore refiner, SPF, salicylic acid scrub, and cleanser are my top favourites! Has this been linked to /r/scacirclejerk yet? It is. What were your issues and what's your simple routine now? I just started watching Dr dray but not sure which vids to watch cause there's so many! Lol I tried to add all types of shit to my routine and turns out anything but micellar water and cetaphil lotion fucks my face to death. Her advice is amazing! Yeah just looking at this irritated my skin lol Weird question but how do you reach your back to use the healing clay? How long does this take you to the everything each day?? How do you like the SkinMedica Lytera? I was looking into that but remain undecided. I use their Essential serum. How do you feel about the perricone brightening serum? The Growth Factor Serum is awesome. So silky and makes your skin really glow! Correct, correct and correct! 


Definitely more than a few problematic products in this Shelfie. 


Do you like your micellar water more than cleansing oils? Also shit for the environment Thank you! You‚Äôre right tho, I‚Äôve heard these are makeup wipes are comedogenic, which is why I only use them in case of emergency laziness. what does it do? I wanted to buy one but wasn't sure Lol op probably doesn‚Äôt actually use all these products. Based on their responses in this thread, it seems like they‚Äôre just advertising all these products. It doesn‚Äôt. This is outrageously excessive, and I doubt OP even uses all these things. Based on their responses in this thread, this seems like some kind of advertisement. 

All most people need is a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer. Of course, everyone‚Äôs skin is different, so some people may need a *few* extra things, but I can guarantee no one actually **needs** all this shit to have nice skin. Not at all! Just finding a Cleanser, Moisturizer and SPF that agrees with your skin can be enough. Plus Curology if you have acne! üíú And you dont need to do more. This is just uneccessary. Why is this aggressively downvoted? People are weird Underrated? It‚Äôs mentioned like in every post on this sub. Lol. It‚Äôs the new CeraVe in the tub. Not at all, but be careful... it‚Äôs a slippery slope ! I‚Äôve been using Curology for almost a year, this is the full size of the treatment cream. It really works wonders Yep. I‚Äôm breathing chemicals as we speak. And drinking an ice cold glass of chemicals. It's top comment now deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3613  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/38321) What do you recommend for acne scars? :( I feel like I‚Äôve tried it all! [deleted] How do you like Cellcosmet? I tried it once at a spa and loved it but wow it‚Äôs expensive Not always though! A few extra steps can go a long way but i definitely don't think u need to soend morw then $15 TOPS per item to get the effect. It depends on h9w much research you're willing to do to find the best bang for your buck. I cant afford a lot but i have end goal expectations so I'm just working to find the priducts that work best for me withi5my budget. If i cant afford it, i cant use it. Nothing wrong with splurging but u definitely dont have to if you dont want to And it makes your skin so tight it feels like it‚Äôs gonna tear Hahahaha bamboozled is a good word for it! lol Psst there‚Äôs an unscented version (the gel-cream) üôÉ Yeah I like the smell too. And if you don't like it, get the Extra-dry version that's unscented AFAIK that's pretty much the only difference. oh fuck you're right Now I can never use it without thinking of this Damn it. Now i feel gross for loving the smell. I'll get that in future, haha. You live, you learn, I suppose. bonus urea content? Lol I was a fool! baha, I'm sorry! > Skinceuticals C E Ferulic

Isn't that the one that's like $160 a bottle?  If I tried it, I'm pretty sure I'd just feel like I'm rubbing dollar bills on my face. Are we cells in a Petri dish? The skin is a living, breathing, organ, and i might not know much about biology but making equivalences between static cell specimens and anti-aging for skin is a Reach. Soo.. you‚Äôre advertising these products or what? Everything about this post is beyond excessive. Oils go on last and help trap moisturiser against skin. Labmuffin has a really good article on this: [https://labmuffin.com/layering-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-moisturiser/](https://labmuffin.com/layering-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-moisturiser/) I agree! At face value it seems expensive but they last a LONG time. So I have really dry sensitive skin with mild rosacea. The problem is that since my skin is so sensitive most cleansers irritate my skin. I also can't use most moisturizers because they break me out or make me red. Now I use vanicream cleanser and abolene as a makeup remover. I also started using the cerave moisturizer and elta md sunscreen with niacinamide everytime I leave my house. I can't believe all the money I wasted for years on all this expensive skincare. The new products I use are so cheap. They also don't cause any irritation.  I would have never considered these brands  without hearing about them fron Dr. Dray. I never break out anymore and my skin barrier is finally healing. You have to either do a search within her page and use key words for your problem areas. For me personally, I would search by acne or oily skin and got a lot of information and product recommendations to try my own routine. I then just binge watched a lot of her videos while at work by just listening and learned so much. I learned how to cleanse and effectively moisturize and my skin has been clearing up so well and I'm definitely starting to see a difference. I got rid of my expensive fragrant filled products that were contributing to my bad skin overtime. If you are concerned about price I may go with a Vitamin C instead, but for those sensitive to Vitamin C or Hydroquinone Lytera 2.0 is, in my opinion, the best option!! Not OP but I used to work for Perricone.

I‚Äôd recommend the 15% Intensive Regimen Vitamin C because it lasts a lot longer and you can see results quickly. I‚Äôd also suggest the Under Eye Brightening Serum - I use it daily and it‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve ever used that‚Äôs made a difference on my dark circles. This lasts _forever_ I‚Äôve had this bottle for over a year now and I‚Äôve barely used 1/8 of the bottle! I actually haven't tried cleansing oils! Is that what you use? I like the clean, non-drying feel of micellar water. Just wish there was a way to achieve results without cotton pads! I‚Äôm not 100% what it does exactly, but I use it after my Lavera tonic and before my day or night moisturiser (Origins Perfect Day/Night-a-Mins), and I *think* it helps the skin absorb the moisture better, and the bee venom clears up impurities and blemishes like no one‚Äôs business. I‚Äôve struggled with dull, tired, blemished skin for years but thanks to this stuff I finally got the glow. I left this sub for awhile, but came back. Glad people have started to appreciate it. You always know someone is about to be rude, when they preface their statement with, "Not to be rude".. [deleted] I mostly tend to sun gaze and sunbathe works better for the skin. But that many to have nice skin ...oof
Girl you a mechanic for yo skin Best comment as well. :D They also duped their customers by adding prescription steroids to their creams and not disclosing it. 14 years later, they removed the steroids from the products. Which of course gave people horrible breakouts from steroid withdrawal because their skin was addicted (that's not the best word probably) and did not have a chance to slowly wean off the product. 

[https://www.wbmllp.com/news/lawsuit-filed-mario-badescu-skin-care-product-line/](https://www.wbmllp.com/news/lawsuit-filed-mario-badescu-skin-care-product-line/) I like this comment, but as a sorta skincare noob, I'd like it a lot more if you made recommendations for what to use instead of what I see in this pic, and why! (: Mario Badescu is just awful in general. No good skin care enthusiasts actually use those products. They're what you use when you're starting out and don't know what to buy yet. Infamously comedogenic. the MB buffering lotion and drying cream have been the *only* products (bar accutane and antibiotics) that worked on my cysts and surface bumps/closed comedones. to an impressive degree. cysts disappearing over night with no marks. maybe the anti aging stuff is bad? but the acne products were amazing... can‚Äôt vouch for other products but i‚Äòm going to try a mask soon too. Such as? But have you tried consistently? Acne scars can fade with exfoliation but of course that‚Äôll take months to see effects What scars do you have though? Ice pick and tethered scars will only get better with targeted treatments like tca cross and subcision. Absolutely not! Routine at bottom of my original comment (: It scrunches up my face, and I enjoy the immense pain/satisfaction of stretching my face out when it‚Äôs dry and watching half of it crumble off. I've been using it like the label says (mixing the powder with ACV), and it's surprisingly foamy?? It only makes my skin feel tight if I left it on too long, taking it off promptly just makes me feel blissfully non-greasy yes I went back and got that one, it's great!

Gave my brother the scented one and his skin has never been more hydrated and supple :) I oddly kinda like it too which is weird cause I almost immediately recognized what it reminded me of. LOL I think they have a slight difference in their names, the hydro boost gel cream is unscented and hydro boost water gel (or something like that) is scented Which is actually good for hydration! I think neutrogena fooled a lot of people. I didn't know there were two different kinds that came in the same jar. I think it‚Äôs like roughly one billion dollars yes that‚Äôs correct. I try not to think about it..... But yeah. Dirty dollars and dead animals. This sounds like me to a T !! Going to check out this person. Wasn't concerned about price, was just asking if you liked it :) Have you seen visible results? Don't they have 2 sizes? The 1-month size and the 2-month super bottle? I agree with you. This looks like the trial bottle. Wtf? No idea what you‚Äôre trying to say. Could not follow a word of that comment. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8177  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/27429) NO WAY! That is awful! They deserve to be sued! Triamcinolone can thin the skin over time with repeated use! Damn! I heard that many of the sheet masks contain steroids to help with brightness.  Not sure if this is true. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9057  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/44175) shut up no way! For the past couple months I've been using the Mario Badescu glycolic face cleanser (instead of the TO glycolic toner coz I heard a glycolic cleanser is better for my skin) and I've gotten closed comedones on my face 3 times in the past two months (and I never get pimples or anything, so I was shocked). Damnnnn So much shade in this comment...I love it. You said exactly what I was thinking! 


Mario Badescu was the first ‚Äúreal‚Äù skincare products I bought...and they were awful. The products also contain ungodly amounts of fragrance. 


Once I actually started learning/researching skincare and ingredients I realized just how awful MB is. I can‚Äôt take anyone that recommends MB seriously. Lol. Yeah exactly! I was one of those people that purchased MB when I first started getting into my skincare routine. I got closed comedones which I never really get, and realized it was related to that! Ooof harsh. I ordered something recently and when it arrive I sent it RIGHT back after getting a better look. Wow I‚Äôm so glad I never bought from that line. I had heard so many great things but none of the products really called out to me. Makes me glad I didn‚Äôt buy something just for the sake of trying it. Hey if it works for some it works you know? The poster is a skincare enthusiast and it seems to be working for her. I myself only use the toner sprays right now. I hear Necessaire is incredible though. It‚Äôs nice to hear a fresh opinion once in a while. Thoughts on the drying lotion? That‚Äôs really a gross overstatement. Pretty much every band has products that are great and others that are gimmicks. I really like the Buffering Lotion, which works great for both my partner and me. I can't vouch for any of their other stuff, but their acne products are actually quite good (and quite popular). deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4135  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/30785) Which product helped get rid of cysts over night? Was it the drying lotion x deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3315  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/45206) for the ingredients you‚Äôre paying for, cerave sells their products for a far better value. For example, I could get ICM's rose water instead of getting their rose water facial spray. I can also get [Mediheal's pink dressing](https://www.testerkorea.com/Product/w_mediheall_azero_shot_skin_control_pink_dressing_13g__cotton_swabs_43551) or [Etude House's pink spot](https://cosmetic-holic.com/product/etude-house-ac-clean-up-pink-powder-spot-15ml/) or [Bye Bye Blemish's dryin lotion](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Bye-Bye-Blemish-For-Acne-Drying-Lotion-1oz-29-5ml-/361913772168) instead of their drying lotion. Yes! I exfoliate. I‚Äôve seen some videos where it‚Äôs recommended every day and then some videos where it says once a week. I‚Äôve switched from once a day then tried once a week and neither one has worked for me. I‚Äôve had them for almost two years now Idk what they‚Äôre called but my skin is smooth when you go over them and they‚Äôre red/pinkish. & acne just keeps coming in my chin/cheek area everywhere else on my face is clear. Don‚Äôt wanna ruin anyone‚Äôs fun or anything.. but apparently waiting until clay masks dry is bad for your skin, cause it dries them out obviously, but also can cause wrinkles from stretching the skin or something, and undoes all the good nutrients the mask just put in?? I can‚Äôt really remember exactly, I would just google if you care How do you take it off your face and dispose of it? I just stared using it but nervous about it clogging the sink! Same girl, same. It's the opposite- hydro boost water gel is scented the gel cream is unscented. I love the water gel though, even with the scent It's the other way around if I'm not mistaken I also use the Lytera 2.0 pigment correcting serum from the skin medica line and it‚Äôs truly lightening my premature sunspots. I actually use the trio, TNS Essential serum, then Lytera, then the HA5 rejuvenating hydrator. I was gifted a set and absolutely love it! Yes!! I‚Äôve noticed about a 75% improvement in my dark spots with religious use. Make sure you get the 2.0 and not the original! If this is the case then I should switch - I feel like it would be better for the environment if it shipped less often??? [removed] Glycolic cleansers are generally not useful (for the exfoliating aspect, anyway) because the acid isn't on your face for long enough to do anything. Perfume is why I can‚Äôt use Biotherm, too strong and irritating for my face and nose üëÉ That doesn't mean MB is bad, it just means it didn't work *for you* The drying lotion seems to be fine for that type of product. It‚Äôs a cheaper, more moisturizing alternative to the Kate Somerville one, however, it does contain talc and titanium dioxide which can be irritating for acne prone skin. Kate Somerville is also more elegant and powerful (10% sulfur). 


I despise MB but this is one of their least problematic products. not the original commenter, but I swear by the drying lotion. It reduces a blemish overnight for me. I don't think I'll ever finish the bottle though because you use such a small amount per spot. I have the drying lotion and the sulpher powder and think both work great. I swear by the lotion and the Drying Mask - nboth help y skin so muchm Of course YMMV but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that their ingredients are terrible. Also, just because something is popular doesn‚Äôt mean it is good. The fragrance and coloring is also very problematic and can lead to issues down the road. the buffering lotion aaaalll the way! the forming ones went away and a few came to a head but didn‚Äôt leave a scar. the drying lotion is better for smaller surface bumps, but it works on top of the buffering lotion too.

edit: and since i‚Äôve started the nip fab glycolic fix pads i haven‚Äôt had any bigger blemishes, not even before my period. good luck!! Agreed, their facial spray is more of a nice sensory feeling for me than actually beneficial. Any alternatives for their buffering lotion? I get rosewater at World Market! TJMAXX usually carries the rosewater Pearlessence spray for about $5, too. What do you use for exfoliation? Physical or chemical? What strength? Everyday is way too harsh for your skin The only thing that worked for me was exfoliating morning and night. I know some people aren‚Äôt into that but it‚Äôs what worked for me to reduce the acne scars (and reduced blackheads drastically). Just had to be consistent for awhile. This is something I definitely never thought about...! I‚Äôm a derm MA and surprisingly this has never come up. I‚Äôm going to ask about this first thing tomorrow! It‚Äôs not actually bad for your skin. It‚Äôs fine during a facial if you wipe it off with a bit of gauze and a tepid towel. You could also put gauze over your face and put the clay mask on over it to help the product come off easier. as well as putting aloe gel over it or on your neck and wipe with a warm wet shammy cloth. steam works beautifully as well for a good 10 minutes if you prefer to keep it damp. Spraying toner or buying a vacuum sprayer to keep the product slightly wet is also a great option.

I use these techniques with my clients and it‚Äôs always fine. As long as you are gentle, but firm and swipe off the clay in an upwards motion on your face you‚Äôll be fine. I think a lot of things are way over dramatized when it comes to the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of skin care regimen, especially seeing as how we‚Äôre all different. 

All I will say though is that in regards of exfoliation, it is completely unnecessary and hurtful to the skin cell renewal process to exfoliate every single day. 

The fact that some people practice twice a day is terrifying to me. If someone truly feels that they need to exfoliate that often, they need to visit a dermatologist for something like a Jessner‚Äôs peel or possible medication, as exfoliation multiple times a day shouldn‚Äôt be needed to achieve a clear complexion. There could an underlying root to this problem. 

Less is more. Only rule to be remembered in esthetics. 

If your skin is congested or you have comedones all over, sure but honestly you could also just use ventouse tube vacuums. Far gentler. I‚Äôd never recommend a client exfoliate more than twice, MAYBE 3 times a week, be it a clean, disinfected Clarisonic/rotary brush. Enzyme/glycolic or a cleanser with jojoba beads for 5 minutes. Trust me when I say the skin will take a beating from all of that and really the point is to boost your cell renewal factor. What good will it do to strip the skin multiple times a day and not allowing it to heal and boast glowy, fresh skin? I‚Äôm down voting just because you ruined my monster face moment. You right imma let you finish but you ruined it !!!! I stand on my front porch and just pick it off into the yard my neighbors love me I've been folding some cheese cloth over itself and then somehow plugging the drain with it, usually by essentially just shoving it down there ü§∑ It causes the water to drain HELLA slow and it can feel like the sink will overflow before you're done taking it off, so I tend to remove it in 3 steps: first, crumble / wipe off as much as you can into a garbage can, then get the rest off into the sink (hopefully not much left) using minimal water, then while the cheesecloth in the sink slowly filters and drains the water, I get the last of the residue off in the shower. The complexity of using the mask without clogging the drain in my very old apartment is the main reason why I rarely use it üòî I put mine on before I shower then I wash it off there :) I use makeup remover wipes!! Not the most environmentally friendly option but it keeps my sink working I apply a thick layer and dont wait for it to dry. Then, when its still soft, i go to tbe bathroom and keep splashing my face with water ubtil it runs off my face by itself. I try to minimize the amount of rubbing i do so cloths and stuff just wouldn't work for me because my skin gets irritated REALLY fast. Splashing water and letting it organically run off works the best for me!! Sorry for the mixup! I‚Äôve updated my comment to reflect this Sorry for the mixup! I‚Äôve updated my comment to reflect this deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0941  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/09584) They do have a larger 2-month supply. It also is cheaper at $40 with free shipping. Total shame. I require correct grammar and punctuation to read, even a fetus has a leg up on me. Hi there,

I've had to remove your comment because it breaks Rule 1: Be kind and respectful. 

We'd like this sub to be a friendly and welcoming place. That's why we don't allow rude or hateful comments. Please be mindful of that in future. 

This is an official warning; continuing to break rule 1 will result in a ban.

If you'd like to know more, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_1._be_kind_and_respectful.). Great advice Thankyou! Back to The Ordinary I happily go üòÇ Agree, I don‚Äôt personally use any other Badescu product bc I find them ineffective and comedogenic, like OP said. I mean I know a lot of people have issues with those things, but a lot of people also don't. I just think that saying "no good skin care enthusiasts actually use those products" is an overstatement. What is the buffering lotion called again? What brand? Thanks xxx the ingredient that i‚Äôve singled out in the buffering lotion and the drying cream is niacinamide so i got the TO serum but it‚Äôs just not as good. but i haven‚Äôt had a cyst in ages so i haven‚Äôt really tried it on those. (hope i won‚Äôt need to, anytime soon :) I don't know about this though! Usually when i catch a cyst forming (before it actually turns into a cyst i guess?) I will slab vaseline on that area. It usually makes it disappear! If the buffering lotion works for you, stick with it! I‚Äôm currently using the brand Bliss - Pore Patrol ‚Äúdaily warming scrub with black volcanic sand‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt specify its strength .....? Does using a (basic) face brush for cleansers count as exfoliation? I mean I assumed so, but also that it would be considered mild enough for everyday. Am I wrong? That sounds full on, wouldn't that completely dry out your skin? Whoa, careful. What kind of exfoliation and what strength? Constant exfoliation has a high chance of destroying your moisture barrier My skin also thrives on chemical exfoliation morning and night! 



I HATE when people come at me with ‚Äúit‚Äôs too much exfoliation‚Äù, or ‚Äúyou really shouldn‚Äôt do it that often‚Äù etc. Everyone‚Äôs skin is different. I‚Äôm a skincare enthusiast, I know my shit. I also have a derm and an esthetician; my skin is healthy and exfoliating twice a day works for me! Whoa there. I would not ever recommend exfoliating that much. That‚Äôs completely unnecessary and you‚Äôre stripping the hell out of your skin doing that. A microderm or enzyme/glycolic peel once a week will do just fine. You need to give your skin time to turnover and grow fresh healthy layers of new skin. I‚Äôve tried exfoliating everyday too maybe I just didn‚Äôt do it long enough...? I have very sensitive skin I‚Äôm excited to hear the answer you get! Replying so I can come back and read your edit for when you ask :) What would you do for blackheads? I have been doing a mud mask once a week, Lol I understand, I too was disappointed Yeah same! I pretty much do the same but without the cheesecloth. Oh well! Okay, this def seems the most practical. Thanks for the  idea! Ok coo No worries, hope it works out better for you! I hear mostly good about the line. I didn‚Äôt personally like it, but I‚Äôm not gonna let a bunch of keyboard dermatologists deter others from trying if they‚Äôd like to. I like every Mario Badescu product that I've tried. The enzyme cleanser and glycolic cleanser were decent and not problematic at least, the drying lotion is great, and the sprays are nice. I also own couple of masks from them, the Flower Tonic one and the healing and soothing one, and no issues there either. 

I'm not going to act like they're the best brand ever or like there aren't better things out there, but shitting all over the entire brand is just snobby and pointless. Some of their products are hits and some are misses, like with pretty much everything. the brand is mario badescu - buffering lotion comes in a tiny plastic bottle thingy. it doesn‚Äôt look fancy but it did the job super well for me, so i always recommend it. cysts are THE WORST :( I do get one of those like once a month, and i was gonna get the buffering lotion but now I'm not so sure anymore :( Can you explain what the buffering lotion is and how it differs from the drying lotion? That‚Äôs quite a mild exfoliation, not gonna do much tbh. Exfoliants that really help are 2-3 times a week (or even once a week if you‚Äôre sensitive) of using chemical exfoliants like the ordinary‚Äôs 7% glycolic acid or aha/bha peeling solution. TO‚Äôs lactic acid is for more sensitive skin. Or even Paula‚Äôs Choice Skin Perfecting BHA exfoliant, for starters.

You could also consider microdermabrasion by a professional. Gets rid of acne scars a bit faster That‚Äôs physical exfoliation. I mean they do work, just not as effectively as chemical exfoliants that also encourage and aid in cell turnover rate. Be careful though, if you‚Äôre too rough with a physical exfoliant they can cause micro tears I mean, I‚Äôm an esthetician in a dermatology office and I would never tell somebody it‚Äôs okay to exfoliate every single day. There are way better things to do for skin then that. But if it works for you then awesome. If you have very sensitive skin you should never be exfoliating that often. Even for people with normal skin. If you exfoliate start with a precleanse for 1 minute then exfoliate for 3-5 minutes. If you want to exfoliate in a gentler way, I‚Äôd recommend doing a ‚Äúpolish‚Äù on your skin with a ventouse tube vacuum. It‚Äôs like a mild form of a microderm for sensitive skin. 

Less is ALWAYS more in esthetics. There is absolutely no need to go overboard. Skin may look fine in the surface for those who exfoliate every day, but mark my words, it will take a toll on your face eventually. Going to an aesthetician/NP that I researched and specialized in fixing the skin concerns that I had, was really helpful to me. It was a good investment for me, and I felt that I was sometimes getting overwhelmed by products and suggestions from others. We started with consistency in a simply routine, and then added in the more aggressive products/parts slowly. If you can‚Äôt go to a specialist yet, just start with the consistency in a simple routine and then slowly introduce what you think will work for you. Good luck! For blackheads I‚Äôd recommend a deep pore facial. Use a simple enzyme peeling mask under steam and use a vacuum like the ones you can buy online or ventouse tubes to help sick them out or use a skin scrubber. If you don‚Äôt have these, a sanitized rotary brush or Clarisonic type of brush will help majorly, just always, always make sure you skin is nice and warm and softened and your black heads should slip on out easily. I like to put hot wet towels over my face under the steam still going the entire time when taking off the enzyme and keep the steam going while doing extractions. Just grab and spray two pieces of gauze wrapped around each index finger with antiseptic and don‚Äôt be afraid to put pressure down to get them out. If you know how to use the needle of a extractor tool pretty well, gently poke the blackhead and put each finger on either side of the area and make a mound of skin under the blackhead and gently roll your fingers until it slides out. Black heads are a bitch I know, but the best way i was taught in school was lots of steam, hot towels and enzymes. Shammy cloths. We use these towels called ‚Äúsoftees‚Äù at my spa and the clay, with a bit of gauze will just slide right off. But the thing is I don‚Äôt know a single dermatologist that would give their stamp of approval on MB, and I‚Äôm a student of dermatology so I know quite a few. So the ‚Äúkeyboard dermatologists‚Äù are correct in this instance. 



There‚Äôs too many problematic ingredients that can lead to issues in the present or way later down the road. And their non-disclosed use of steroids just proves they‚Äôre okay with shady practices. 



People can use whatever the hell they want on their skin, but I don‚Äôt see an issue with letting people know a line is problematic. Dude tbh, if it works and if it‚Äôs not used like 10x a day for years i say give it a shot even if people on this thread say MB products are ‚Äöproblematic‚Äò. The buffering lotion was a gamechanger for me. I apply it when i feel that first redness and the diffuse bump juuuust forming and 3/5 times it literally went away over night. Some cysts have come to a head which was also ok (sterile lancet and hydrocolloid stickers did the rest :) The buffering lotion is liquid with a powdery residue that mixes with the liquid when you shake it. As opposed to the MB drying lotion which only requires the application of the ‚Äûresidue‚Äú from the bottom of the bottle with a q-tip on the pimple, which then dries. The buffering lotion works best on deep cysts, the drying lotion (and the drying cream) are effective on smaller surface blemishes.

It‚Äôs a bit awkward to apply to affected areas because it‚Äôs so fluid but i usually pour a drop in my palm anf then dab it on with my finger. For bigger cysts i sometimes apply it with a thin cotton pad that i press on for a few minutes. It works really well if after the application it‚Äôs ‚Äûsealed‚Äú with a drying mask or the drying lotion. 


Hope this helped :) I have been wanting to try the ordinary ‚Äî I‚Äôll purchase that one you mentioned and give it a try. At this point I‚Äôm trying anything I can. Thanks for the tip ! Ok good to know, thanks! I agree 200%. I would never tell someone to use chemical exfoliation as frequently because most people will destroy their skin. 


Neither of them ever told me to exfoliate twice a day. They just confirmed my skin is healthy. And approved of carrying on. It‚Äôs something I slowly started doing after years of using exfoliating acids and my skin completely changed for the better. It honestly was the only way I got rid of my closed comedones. Extraction facials have drastically been reduced. 


I started Tretinoin at the beginning of the year and sadly my acid use has all but ceased due to my sensitive skin adjusting to strength increases. And my texture/closed comedones are back with a vengeance. Ooooh okay. I didn‚Äôt necessarily like exfoliating everyday. I‚Äôll try the polish you recommend thank you ! Thank you!! I do have a simple routine so I guess I just have to experiment with products. Just like you said it‚Äôs overwhelming Thank you You know, if you‚Äôre unsure you can also go to a dermatologist if you have the money, at least there‚Äôs more weight to a professional‚Äôs words than mine on the internet haha Anytime love. Just make sure your face is wet before you use the vacuum. It‚Äôs super super easy. lol yeah I getcha. I just wanted to maybe get some advice cause I‚Äôm so desperate. I‚Äôll have to see how much a visit to the dermatologist will cost. Thanks tho I really do appreciate all the help thank you üò© **Hi everyone!

Personally I‚Äôm not noticing a difference but I do find it dries my skin out. Omg where did you get a big tube of the Biore? I‚Äôve only been able to find the small tubes and I end up buying four at a time. Hi friends! This is my current routine! I‚Äôve expanded a lot since my last post and am so thankful for all your lovely suggestions! I‚Äôve been trying to find dupes for glossier skincare as I love it but I can‚Äôt justify the price point üò≠ 

Skin type: combination 
Skin goals: to be glossy and dewy, less breakouts.

Reviews: 

-The elf illuminating  cream is my favourite for under the eyes! It‚Äôs super gentle and is a great base for makeup, fast absorbing too! Overall a great simple eye cream for a super adorable price! 

-for everyone asking about the caffeine treatment from the ordinary this is my second bottle and I love it! I find it really helps to reduce the dark circles under my eyes, it‚Äôs a little easy step that can really help with confidence in the long run if you‚Äôre self conscious about your under eyes. I haven‚Äôt experienced any dryness. 

-I just got the biore UV essence the other day but I really like it so far! I was recommended to use  a sunscreen daily by this sub so this is the one I decided to get! It‚Äôs fast absorbing, doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast and doesn‚Äôt leave my face feeling greasy at all! 

AM: 

-Cerave hydrating or milky jelly cleanser 

-The ordinary toner or glossier solution

-The ordinary hyaluronic acid and niacinamide forumlas mixed all over the face 

-The ordinary moisturising factors or priming moisturiser 

-The ordinary caffeine under eye treatment

-Elf illuminating eye cream 

-Biore UV watery essence 

PM: 

-ultrabland cleanser as first cleanse 

The rest of the routine is the same but I use the neutrogena hydro boost gel as moisturiser:)) Love love Ultrabland! This product completely changed my skin 2 years ago and I usually just use it on its own, plus a weekly BHA mask by The Ordinary. Looks lovely! How do you like the Biore SPF? I feel like I‚Äôm one of the few people who hasn‚Äôt tried it but I‚Äôm a bit wary of the alcohol haha Hey! How do you feel about the elf illuminating eye cream? I want to incorporate one into my routine but I hear mixed opinions about whether or not eye creams are useful [deleted] How are you finding CeraVe? I've heard some good things about it but I'm so obsessed with my current cleanser I'm not sure if I'm ready to try it out. Can you tell me more about the Biore UV? What is the finish like? I‚Äôm using an SPF from the brand Tula that gives me a glow that I LOVE, but I HATE spending $40 USD on such a small tube of sunscreen. The glow I get from it gives my dull skin life like nothing else ever has. That sunscreen is wonderful, I got it on amazon too! It really feels like skincare I wear it sometimes even if I'm in all day because it makes me skin look and feel so fresh Ohh how are you liking the Ultrabland from LUSH? Been thinking about possibly trying it... but I haven‚Äôt had much luck with LUSH skincare in the past. ü§î Looks lovely! How do you find the ultrabland cleanser? The ordinary tho. They good Hi! Love the rainy background. What do you use TO natural moisturizing factors for? I‚Äôm so glad I stopped to look at your shelfie. I‚Äôve been looking into a better sunscreen, I have been using Neutrogena but I feel like it makes me oily and heavy on the skin. Is the Biore ok for combo skin? Jealous of your very large tub of Ultrabland! That is my favorite Lush cleanser, but I can't get it in anything bigger than 3.5oz Excuuuuse me, is that a GIANT tub of Ultrabland? I didn‚Äôt know it came in that size! I love The Ordinary. I really am shocked that they can offer such high quality ingredients at such a low price point. My skin has never looked better! I use TO Natural Moisturizing HA is a great product.  I love using TO 10% Niacinamide serum.  It works great for PIH and PIE. Honestly amazing choices! I absolutely love Ultrablend for heavy makeup days, maybe followed by 9 to 5 always from Lush I use that Cera Ve hydrating cleanser too! Its so good. 

My skin is so dry and flakey so Hydro Boost did nothing for me lol but I do use those The Ordinary products. Hey is the ordinary cleanser any good? Great choices. Have you thought about adding The Ordinary AHA/BHA peel once per week? It‚Äôs great. You may also benefit from The Ordinary Vitamin C powder in the morning and The Inkey List Retinol at night. I keep going back and forth on that elf eye cream! I love it and then a week later I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs disappointing! Where do you buy your Cerava cleanser? Thought it was only in the US! Those are some cute homes in the back! How do you like TO moisturizing factors? By the way is this northern England? My parents live there, makes me miss the UK‚ù§Ô∏è How do you find the Biore sunscreen?? I use Cerave hydrating too! I love it! Love that sunscreen Question: What do you like about the caffeine? Is that the Dursley‚Äôs flat across the way? stealing this routine ‚ú® I need honest reviews about The Ordinary. I don‚Äôt have pimples anymore but I have marks, not really that bad but up close you can see. I‚Äôm thinking about getting this brand. Need helpppp. Thanks!! dang i'm here in the US but we literally have almost the same routine with the ordinary products, the cleanser, and the biore UV sunscreen. i love it! How do you like The Ordinary products? Is it too good to be true? I know the price is unreal! Been trying to get the ordinary glycolic acid for so long:( out of stock everytime in US How about eye bags? Mine aren‚Äôt necessarily dark but sort of hollow. How do you have the time in your morning routine to apply so many of them? I can only put on 2 creams at most What do you think of ultrabland? I used to use it years ago and LOVED it, I stopped
Because it was so high maintenance to use but have thought about going back periodically Is the toner from TO actually worth it ? Why does your Biore UV look so big? They do a bigger size?? Did you like that caffeine? I returned mine I'm coming late to the party here... Have you found the hydro boost works under the Biore? I've seen reviews saying that people get piling issues when they try and apply SPF over it. Is TO acid good? How to use? Or add into my toutine Wow, that's a lot (no shade). Am I doing it wrong? I only use Burt's Bee's products. Can you suggest anything to someone with sensitive skin new to skin care? That's a lot of product. I only use three things . boooooo Lush! Not OP, but I used TO caffeine and then stopped because I wasn‚Äôt noticing any difference. Then a while after stopping I found myself looking in the mirror going ‚Äúwow why are my under eyes so dark?‚Äù So I did go back to using it. 
I don‚Äôt find it drying though, I can see how that would be irritating. It dried my eye area so bad, dark circles didn't seem like a problem anymore. This is my second bottle of the undereye treatment and I really like it! I haven‚Äôt noticed any difference in terms of dryness! I think it's a sign that literally 30 minutes ago I was in store, almost bought it and then just randomly clicked on this thread lol Not OP,  but I am shocked at the difference it is making to me.  I wake up feeling exhausted, look in the mirror and think why can't I feel the way I look?  It has always been the other way round for me!

I am concerned it feels drying, but it doesn't seem to have affected my make up, which drying products normally do. Not OP, but I‚Äôm not convinced it does anything for me. I‚Äôm just gonna use it till I run out and probably won‚Äôt reorder it Same here and I've read reviews of people saying it makes their under eye area worse If you're interested in an improvement over the caffeine treatment,  try K-ox. I just switched and immediately noticed my under eyes were brighter and smoother. Makeup goes on and stays on way better. Also zero puffiness. Its everything I wanted out of the caffeine treatment but unfortunately that didn't work well for me. Not OP - I used it for a while and noticed small breakout spots/bumps under my eyes?! I know it‚Äôs cheap but it‚Äôs not even really worth the small amount it costs in my opinion. A shame because I love a lot of other Ordinary products! 40 year old here who loves the TO caffeine .  It makes a huge difference for my eyes.  It smooths out my under eye and I see less dark circles!! It hasn‚Äôt done much for me and I‚Äôve used it for like a year and a half now I like it a lot. I only use it in the evening and I have no dark circles or puffiness in the morning. It doesn't dry out my under eye area, but I use a moisturizing under eye cream in the morning. Not the OP, but the very first time I used it, my eyelids got tingly and slightly dry. However, I was quite heavy handed with it. The next night i used less and my lids weren't as tingly and didn't dry out at all. Both times, my eyes were less puffy than they normally are in the morning. I can't say what it does for dark circles, as I don't have that problem (yet). 

I've continued to use it without any issues and will probably use the whole bottle simply because I don't like wasting product. 

Does it make enough of a difference to repurchase? Nah. 

But am I also a 24yo whose morning puffy eyes go away after about an hour anyway and who doesn't get dark circles? Yeah.

Will I try it out again if these issues become an actual issue for me? Also yeah. 

tl;dr: less product is more. Not worth it for young people, but it still feels nice. Not OP but cosmebear on ebay sells a big bottle of the 2019 version of the SPF in their shop! They ship directly from Japan and I personally prefer to order from them instead of Amazon. Even though shipping isn‚Äôt free, I feel more confident I am getting a ‚Äúfresher‚Äù bottle and that makes it worth it to me :) On Amazon! :) Can you please add in a mini review for each product?  It's something we require for Shelfie posts.  Thanks! Nice choices, I use a lot of the same products. You might want to swap out your current version of hydro gel for the fragrance-free version, especially since it is on your skin all night long. Also, TO glycolic toner is fairly strong, are you using it twice a day? That might be overkill. I would only use it 3-4 times per week. Did you go through a purging with the niacinamide? That elf eye cream is one of the only things that doesn't irritate the skin around my eyes, and it's sooo smooth. I can never find it at stores near me and don't like ordering extra stuff online, but it is such a gooooood product. I think we have the same skin Except for ultrabland, what is another good way of double cleansing? 



I've got combination skin,

Currently I'm using 
- fresh cleanser
- fresh toner
- fresh moisturizer
- occasionally I'll add the 2% bha Paula choice 
- occasionally neogen gauze peeping green tea

I was thinking of getting cerave pm moisturizer also, Cus of the very good review.


2. My issue was breakout, because I had to do facial extraction every month, but now due to mco I have stopped doing that. 
- preciously I also used the product lumin, which caused my skin to breakout even more. 
- I have tried many products, some times I get good skin, and other times I jusy breakout.
- so far using fresh, it's still pretty good, and under control.

Please, Anyone can advise? I‚Äôm intrigued, what is the texture of the Ultrabland cleanser? Is it like a cleansing balm or does it foam? How is it with removing makeup? If I don't use make up at all, but I know my skin is not fully cleansed usually.
Should I go for this cleaNse? I definitely smelled the alcohol right away. Feels nice enough but after this tube I'm going back to the Canmake mermaid gel. I shouldn't have strayed since that ones perfect but I like trying new things and the Biore is a slightly better value. For the record I have very dry sensitive skin. I‚Äôve been using it for a year, it‚Äôs my fav! I don‚Äôt mind the alcohol! It does have quite a strong alcohol smell to it üò© I only just got it the other day so I‚Äôm pretty new to it! I just started using it, was also scared of the alcohol. But all the sunscreens that I've used without alcohol break me out... For a sunscreen with alcohol it's really gentle for the skin and I love the finish as somebody with sensitive, acne prone and dry skin, i‚Äôve started using Biore since the start of May switching from Keihl‚Äôs and i have no regrets whatsoever. I‚Äôve been using it for a year and love it. I have really dry sensitive skin too. Same! I haven't tried it yet because of the amount of alcohol in it. I used to use the body shop one which I think is pretty much the same in terms of ingredients and consistency.. I always have the feeling that these types of spf aren't as protective as heavier/alcohol free ones? It‚Äôs such a great sunscreen!! I find it quite drying tbh, on oily skin, but everything else I've ever tried is greasy and shiny. Think I prefer being a little bit dry. I tried it but found it to be not moisturising enough for me! So I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd have to worry about it being too heavy I use it and I love it. I don‚Äôt find it heavy at all. I got to nmf as part of the daily set originally and love it so much that I went and bought the largest size offered when I finished that bottle. I have combo skin which can get oily during the summer and is flaky during the winter, and I don't find it to be too heavy at all for summer and plenty moisturizing during the winter. It gives all day moisture, even it's like negative humidity and -12 F below and I'm at work in the hospital all day, which is something I really struggled with in previous moisturizers. They'd last for the first hour or two of my shift and then disappear. I have quite dry skin and I found it just wasn‚Äôt strong enough. On my t zone where it‚Äôs oilier it‚Äôs was perfect though. I don‚Äôt find it particularly moisturizing and definitely not heavy in my opinion! I have quite oily skin and I find it a touch on the heavy side so I use it at night. I use marine hyaluronics if I have a midday shower so I don't go OTT. You're getting lots of mixed reviews here, but I have dry skin and it's perfect as a light day moisturizer in the summer. I hate that feeling of moisturizer sitting on my skin and this absorbs and disappears - completely non-greasy.  I put the biore UV stuff pictured in this post over it for daytime.

I picked this up because it was cheap and it has far exceeded my expectations. Not OP, but I‚Äôve been using the CeraVe cleanser for years. My skin freaks out when I try any other cleanser. Not OP - but I used it for another a month and it broke me out terribly and irritated my skin! I have noticed that the US version has a different ingredient list than the UK version that I used though I like it!!! I bought it to replace milky jelly and I like it so far! Super gentle The hydrating cleanser is incredible, the only one I've used so far that doesn't dry me out. Not OP but I recently switched to it and my sensitive, dry skin has never been so calmed down! It won't give you a glow. It absorbs very quickly and leaves your skin looking and feeling fresh and soft, but definitely not glowy. I'm on Amazon now and there's a 2018 formula and a 2019 formula both being sold by the verified Biore account. Any idea which one you use? I work for LUSH actually! Tbh I agree that quite a lot of our skincare is fragranced. But ultrabland is hence the name very bland and simple! It‚Äôs only got ten ingredients in it! It‚Äôs my absolute favourite thing for taking off makeup, when I rub around my eyes it doesn‚Äôt sting and it makes taking makeup off so satisfying! I had it and repurchased it, it was great for getting makeup off but definitely needs a second cleanser to get a bit of the residual oiliness off. totally going to repurchase again once i finish my TO squalane cleanser. ultrabland is really thick and doesn‚Äôt emulsify so is best to use a bit mixed warmed up in wet hands on a wet face. i love lush but their fragrances drive me insane, also now they have ultraplant which is similar but with no beeswax for vegans :) Ultrabland is so nice! The trick to really get it to work is by using a very warm washcloth to rinse it off because it will help melt everything and make your skin feel less greasy. 
It‚Äôs one of the best products lush makes. In another comment they say they‚Äôre using it as their AM moisturizer Yep!! I order it online! [deleted] They're widely available in Europe as well now. It is!! And I like it so far!! I find it does really help to reduce my dark circles! They‚Äôre terrible neighbours üôÑüôÑ I love the ordinary!! I‚Äôve been using their stuff for a while and it never disappoints Tbh lockdown has given me a lot more time than I know what to do with ü§£ I like it so far!! They do! I really like it!!! I don‚Äôt use it with sunscreen because I apply it at night so I‚Äôm not sure! Sorry friend :( There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to do skincare! Just whatever works for you! :)) and cerave is really nice!! Bruh Yeah I had a similar experience! Did they change the bottle? I noticed my cap is white!

Also do you get the weird crust around the opening? Are you finding a difference in the puffiness or discolouration? I‚Äôve only used it a handful of times because it feels a bit irritating/dry but maybe my skin hasn‚Äôt adjusted. 

I was really excited to try as since about 6 months ago my under eye area has gotten a lot darker. Iron levels are fine, which is too bad because that‚Äôs an easier fix. I experienced dryness at the corner of my under eyes, but I was using it both in the morning and at night. I stopped applying it in the morning, and the dryness stopped. I also have seen a massive improvement in my under eye area, and I have been using it for about 2 and a half months now. I wonder if the formula is too strong for a lot of people to apply it as often as TO recommends? [Uh not quite the same price point at TO....](https://www.isdin.com/us/under-eye-cream-isdinceutics_k_ox_eyes.html) I hope it's better for 10x the price That sounds like Milia. Were the bumps hard? 
They‚Äôre caused by a few things, one being dehydrated under eye skin. I stopped getting them all the time once I started using eye cream day and night and started wearing sunglasses more (they can also be caused by UV rays).

/rant Thank you so much! Your routine looks great btw.üëå I‚Äôve read some reviews about the 2019 version not being as great and smelling strongly of alcohol. Interested in trying it though. Do you find this is true? Thanks for the tip :) I'm definitely bookmarking Cosmebear for my next purchase. I miss the 2018 version of this stuff so much though, the fresh citrus-y scent was my favorite! The 2019 smells more like alcohol to me, but I don't mind it. There is a fragrance-free hydro boost?? If OP's routine is working for them, there's really no reason to make these recommendations. If they arent experiencing any sensitivity then theres nothing wrong with fragrances or exfoliating twice a day. I have sensitive dryish skin and got no purging or irritation, it‚Äôs a must have for me and i‚Äôve repurchased several times! seems reactions to this one are either really good or really bad Niacinamide makes me break out so bad Obviously it doesn‚Äôt work for everyone but double cleansing has helped me.

I start with the ordinary‚Äôs rosehip oil on dry skin and let it sit for a few minutes. I wash it off with water then use yes to tomatoes salicylic acid face wash. It has helped me break out less and I have a lot less blackheads. I swear by it, i think my only skincareAddiction posts are me saying now awesome it is lol. Its a balm, and i find it gets off anything i use - anything that it won't get off I figure is too harsh for my skin. It's almost like a firm butter. 

Its pretty greasy, so I'm looking into a water-based cleanser to use after it, but it's very hydrating. It's a cleansing balm. I'm using ultraplant, similar texture and ingredients. 

I can fully say it works ok, better than anything at a box store but I still prefer other cleansers. It's good at removing makeup but not my sunscreen. I have to keep it in the fridge since it's melting in my bathroom. It‚Äôs worth a try, I would see if you can get a sample pot from Lush :) Funny I just used these two for the first time back to back and canmake mermaid gel is so pleasant and biore has a nice texture but damn I feel like there‚Äôs a bottle of alcohol being held under my face. Who whee! The most alcohol I‚Äôve ever come across in any product. I'm on Amazon now and there's a 2018 formula and a 2019 formula both being sold by the verified Biore account. Any idea which one you use? does it dry down matte at all? I have very oily skin and I much prefer a matte rather than dewy look I'm on Amazon now and there's a 2018 formula and a 2019 formula both being sold by the verified Biore account. Any idea which one you use? I just went to check and it was the 2019 formula Oohhhh! üòÑ that‚Äôs awesome! But yeah, I really wish I could use more skincare from LUSH but the fragrance just kills my skin. (I swear by Curly Wurly and Candy Rain for my hair though!) üòÅ When stores open up here again (Canada) I‚Äôll get a sample of Ultrabalm and give it a shot! Great thank you! So do you prefer ultrabland over TO squalane cleanser? I find the TO cleanser just right for a single-step cleansing so just wondering what you found the differences to be! Thanks üòä Amazing thank you for sharing I should have a look into it! thank you ! Amazing! Do you find that you‚Äôre able to use it all before it expires? I love me some Ultrabland, but that is a LOT of Ultrabland. Thank you! I am in England, have just found this subreddit and have been obsessing over James Welsh and Hyram on YouTube. My face is going to be so smooth. No prob! Lush is canceled. Mine gets crusty around the opening too. I thought I had a bad batch or something. Hmmm maybe I'll try it just at night time I only have experience with the 2019 version of the sunscreen but I really like it and notice little to no alcohol scent. If I smell the tube and focus/search for the alcohol I notice it, but in the morning when I am applying it - nothing. I didn't realize people were saying the 2019 version wasn't as great as other years, but on me (oily skin) it gives a nice natural-matte finish. It's one of my 'dumb reach'/go-to sunscreens. I've used the 2019 and the previous version as well. The 2019 one smells more like alcohol but it dissipates quickly. The previous iteration had this amazing fresh citrus scent that made me excited to put it on every day and I miss it dearly. Texture/finish-wise, I can't tell much of a difference between the two formulas. I'm a greasebomb and it is the only SPF I'll use on my face! Whichever one I got smells so intensely of alcohol and citrus that you feel like it you are breathing it hours later. Yes. It is the "extra dry skin" formula. Yeah it‚Äôs the dry skin version Why would you post your entire skincare routine if you‚Äôre not open to recommendations? Also fragrance and overexfoliation can have long term effects that may not be apparent in the first few months of use I‚Äôm in your boat. Multiple repurchases in the past two years and it‚Äôs the only that‚Äôs worked for my acne and redness. Same!! I‚Äôm trying TO 10% niacinimide and I thought I was going through a purging phase but someone told me niacinamide doesn‚Äôt cause purging so I‚Äôm kind of freaking out here. I‚Äôve had niacinamide before, but at 4% in my curology, and my skin didn‚Äôt react as bad as it is now with TO. It‚Äôs sad because I want all the benefits of niacinimide but I guess I‚Äôll have to find another way. It‚Äôs mainly dark spots that I want gone. Omg me too!! I‚Äôve got TO Niacinimide and I‚Äôve only been using it for like a week so far and my breakouts have gotten a lot worse! Same here! Not zits or so but I suspect I got some  allergic reactions (little bumps) because of niacinamide :(

I haven't apply it the entire week and those bumps are not that red anymore. Although I also stop using other "suspicious" products, in my case, which are hyaluronic acid, niacinamide or LRP Shaka Fluid sunscreen. I made a mistake and started using them at the same time, d'oh! (I did a patch test and all good) I've learnt my lesson.

On the other hand I love TO Glycolic Acid!

Wish me luck because most of TO are worthwhile :) Did you find it well to remove waterproof eye make up? I recently used Inkey List oat cleansing balm as a cheaper alternative to DHC oil but it didnt really remove waterproof eye make up =| curious about Ultrabland. Yeah it‚Äôs definitely not for everyone, but the beeswax in it seems to create a barrier on the skin which protects and nourishes it, without getting really greasy. So I don‚Äôt use it with moisturiser, just a sunscreen during the day. tbh I don‚Äôt pay attention that closely! I just get the biggest one and call me sun protected! I think it depends on your skin type, but it doesn‚Äôt make me oily at all. My skin is oily combo and i find it very moisturizing not matte at all. is there a code difference or something to tell them apart? She‚Äôs using the 2019 version. Sweet thank you! Awesome! I hope you like it!! :)) ultrabland is definitely not a single step bc it‚Äôs thick and doesn‚Äôt completely come off with water so i think it depends what you‚Äôre looking for. i haven‚Äôt tested TO with makeup but i find it stings my eyes a bit and ultrabland does not and takes off all makeup. if you like the simplicity and TO doesn‚Äôt irritate you stick w that but i like lush‚Äôs recyclable packaging and don‚Äôt mind an extra step. hope that helps! This is my first post of this size! So fingers crossed!! ü§£ü§£ Why? Lmao Mine too Same here My partner and I both have oily skin so we will be giving a try. Thanks for the info! What long term effects does fragrance have on the skin? I didn't know it was a thing Doesn‚Äôt cause purging but it seems some people break out because of it Nice! I'm going to assume whatever they changed wasn't a huge deal, given that this sub didn't implode in 2019 with posts lamenting everyone's HQ SPF having a formula change. I'm going with the 2019 cause it's a better deal! The SPF rating is at the bottom and in blue in the 2018 version whereas it‚Äôs in white and right at the bottom of the Biore UV logo in the 2019. There's a drop down menu you can toggle between. The 2019 version comes in a slightly smaller tube, I'm searching this sub now to see if anyone had talked about a formulation change. Lovely thanks very much!!! Haha! Best of luck! According the the Dermatology Times, fragrances are most likely to cause allergic contact dermatitis. They account for 30-45% of reactions in cosmetic products. You can develop an allergy to the fragrance. It happened to me once. I used a cleanser for about 6 months and everything was fine but then it started to give me a rash immediately after use. Switched to the fragrance free version and no more rash. Lab Muffin recently has said that only about 5% of people are sensitive to fragrance and that you can keep using it if it's not an issue for you. Dermatologists recommend fragrance free products just to be on the safe side. When you figured out it caused you to break out, did you stop using niacinamide altogether or did you start using a small percentage? thank you. now i know i use the 2019 version! Ah I see. That makes sense, thanks. So far I‚Äôve stopped using it all together. If you were fine with a lower percentage, I'd try to find that in a product by another brand. TO's made me breakout so bad but other products in my routine who have niacinamide are fine. That‚Äôs for this advice, I‚Äôll definitely be on the look out for lower percentages! Unrelated but I am laughing my ass off at the lengths you went not to get your face in the pic!! I feel like we‚Äôre soul sisters Top 3 reviews-

Glossier Solution: I love this product for an everyday chemical exfoliator. The packaging with a pump makes it so easy and clean to apply. Scent is nice and somewhat unnoticed. First time I applied it did tingle a bit, but now my skin is used to it and it just helps to keep my skin from being dull. 

Trader Joe‚Äôs Rose Water Toner: Truly one of my holy grails. This Toner is so light and mellow (no alcohol). I apply this before serum or moisturizer. Although this Toner seems like it might not do much I do believe I saw a difference in the overall tone of my skin which was much more even. Packaging and scent are both great. Perfect before serum to lock in moisture. 

Drunk Elephant Baby Facial: Only got this the other day but holy moly it truly made my skin childlike and brand new. This did tingle and after I took it off it did leave a bit of a burn, but that was completely gone after 1 hour. I used my Milk Cooling water stick on the burn and then added the Marula oil and my night moisturizer on top. Woke up the next morning and my skin looked fantastic. Packaging like all Drunk Elephant products is beautiful. Bottom row is my everyday products, and middle is my more once a week products and samples. Didn‚Äôt include the top because it‚Äôs not nearly as pretty and put together.

Other- Olhenricksons exfoliator (few times a week in shower when skin feels like it‚Äôs needed) [deleted] r/mirrorsforsale What does Brazilian bum bum cream do?? Ooh so pretty! What do you think of the glow recipe stuff (the watermelon sleep mask and pineapple serum) ? Not skincare but do you like the quip toothpaste? I have the brush and I love it, it‚Äôs so easy to have the refill sent to you when it is time to change! I‚Äôve been thinking about adding the toothpaste to my order. Can someone tell me what the hype is about with Glossier? I‚Äôm broke (fresh out of school) so can‚Äôt afford to try it just yet haha It is a crime how attracted to minimalist aesthetically pleasing products I am. Also love that TJ's Rose toner. we are skincare soul sisters! bum bum cream is my holy grail, and i love my tatch and drunk elephant. I recently got the Trader Joes toner!! I absolutely love it. My skin swings between dripping oil and so dry you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd never drank water in my entire life. It‚Äôs somehow worked wonders in both of those states.

Edit: spelling I think this is the first shelfie I've seen without any products from The Ordinary lol (no hate, I have plenty of my own!) [deleted] Has anyone tried the pineapple serum from glow recipe? I‚Äôm looking at buying it just wanna know if it‚Äôs good. I never realized Trader Joe's had skincare products! Now I want to try that toner (and see what other goodies they have). :) Shelfie goals üò©üíï Awesome shelfie! I absolutely love the Tatcha Water Cream The Water Cream is my holy grail product. My skin has never looked or felt better. Skincare group I was in on FB hated the stuff so I‚Äôm glad to see it on someone else‚Äôs shelf! Bum bum cream!!‚ù§Ô∏è I never thought I‚Äôd spend so much money on lotion but it‚Äôs so goooodüôåüèª i feel the struggle of the mirror shelfie in a spiritual level 

im seeing so many people trying trader joe stuff. im so jealous cause i can‚Äôt get it and i can‚Äôt imagine a supermarket having any good house brand product let alone skincare product Nice looking shelfie!! How do you find the Brazilian bum cream?? i wantüòç This reminds me of when people sell mirrors on Craigslist lmaoooo I love it Have you tried Thayers toner? Curious how the Trader Joe's toner compares. What is your favorite drunk elephant product and why? Girls got schmoney *reddits favorite products Watch out for the Trader Joe‚Äôs toner. It has alcohol in it and made my skin red. Love the shelfie, thanks for sharing! I‚Äôve started to wonder if that Trader Joe‚Äôs toner breaks me out.. anyone else? How do you like the glossier products?? Also can you share how you came up with the schedule for when you do things? Would love to know! Thanks How do you like the Glow Recipe vit C serum? Is it worth the money? the trader joe's rosewater spray is one of my favourite recent purchases. love it - the dispense of the prodcut feels so nice and the effect of the formulation itself on my skin can only be described as incredibly soothing :) Best "Shelfie" ever, we know no filters were used üëçüëç Absolutely gorgeous! Unrelated to skin care but how do you like the quip dental care system? Been looking into it and was interested in an honest not paid for review if you have an opinion one way or the other.

Edit: never mind just saw that you already answered. Thanks! How do you like your quip? How is the quib stuff??? Any good? Someone is Sephora VIB Rouge üëÄ Serious question. Is it good for your skin to have this many products? I feel like at some point it would be way too much stuff to put on your face How‚Äôs that pineapple serum work for you? Does it do anything special Oooohhhh, how's the Glow Recipe pineapple serum?? I've been eyeing it for a while now Are you going to buy a full size of that green sample? I use that toothpaste as well! I love my quip! Okay I‚Äôve been debating on getting the glossier toner.. is it actually worth $24? I‚Äôm using thayers toner right now and I just don‚Äôt think it works 

What are your thoughts? That's dedication! And here I thought cleanser -> antiox serum -> hydrating serum -> moisturizer was a lot! Good for you! How is the Glow Pineapple? Tatcha and the pineapple glow serum ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è What is your skin type? I‚Äôd like to try some of these! ‚ÄòBrazilian Bum Bum Cream‚Äô Pretty!! Bruh what's bum bum cream LOOOOOOOL

SOUNDS COOL idk how to feel about a skincare product named "Brazilian Bum Bum" cream. Y‚Äôall got money money üí∞üí∞üí∞ Not to sound rude but I would consider this skincare gluttony. Nice looking shelf! You know what sucks is I realllllly wanted to like the drunk elephant Lala retro moisturizer. But when I took it to my derm they said all those oils in there aren‚Äôt doing anything for my skin. And there is so scientific backing or detailed explanation of where they come from and how/why they work. So I discontinued it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è now I kinda stay away from any skin care product that isn‚Äôt backed by research that proves to do what it says it does. Showoff [deleted] I have a question, isn't the amount of products you're using a little too much and unnecessary? I only have 3 products and my skin is perfect with them. Should i take the "addiction" literal in "skincare addiction"? Omg girl i had to take like 20 photos to get one that a. Didn‚Äôt have my face in it, b. Was not blurry, and c. Had somewhat decent lighting. The struggle. r/mirrorsforsale I vaguely recall there being a sub dedicated to people avoiding taking a picture of themselves while photographing a mirror (or something in front of a mirror). I love the lengths some people go to! (And it makes me feel not alone.) I see you have a sample of Drunk Elephant‚Äôs chemical exfoliator. How would you compare it to Solution? I currently use the DE one but I‚Äôm thinking of switching to Solution when it runs out because it‚Äôs like 1/3 the price. Also love the Trader Joe‚Äôs rose water toner! I use it every morning and it definitely helps my acne without drying out my face How do you like the Milk Makeup products? Lovely shelfie!! Hi! You have pretty much all the [required Shelfie info](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_7._follow_our_post_requirements) except for reviews. 

Can you add either:

   - Short mini reviews for each of your products (e.g. "Smells like pepperoni pizza and feels like jello but man it really helped with my burgeoning devil horns!")

   - Longer in-depth reviews for your top 3, which should at least cover: the packaging, product feel & smell, what are the positive & negative effects, does it do what it should/what you bought it for, and overall opinion

Lemme know when you‚Äôve added that info :) How do you like Trader Joe‚Äôs? Woah you mean business with that skincare schedule I love the watermelon mask!!! It saves my poor USA midwest dry winter time skin!!! The initial price is definitely a shock, I am lucky that my bf got this for me for a bday gift thank goodness, but it will last for a LONGGG time (like the whole shelf life I feel). How do you like the serum? I am debating on buying it and i am unsure... Do you use an spf you like? Wait, Trader Joe‚Äôs has skincare products??? Do you use the oil right after the baby facial for a reason? I'm scared of starting my CORX bha/aha clarifying toner because I don't know how to handle the added irritation. I have heard very good things about the moisturizer. Might try that when the Tatcha runs out. Fucking love that sub Just smells good lolol It smells awesome. I use AmLactin as my actual lotion, since it‚Äôs the only thing that works for my incredibly dry skin, but it smells awful. So I cover it with the BBBC. Supposed to tighten skin and reduce cellulite. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen much difference. Smells nice; that's about it. As moisturizers go, SDJ has three and they're not *bad*, but most people use them because of their scents, not their ingredients. The Coco Cabana's the best of the three in terms of ingredients (saccharide isomerate, cupua√ßu butter, beta-glucan, panthenol, sodium hyaluronate, etc) but a lot of people dislike the scent and describe it as "buttered popcorn." 

I got jars of all three back before SDJ nerfed their reward program and rotate them as lightweight AM moisturizers, but the only one I'll repurchase is the Coco Cabana (though not at retail, only if I can find a deal/there's a sale), because it smells like warm toasted coconut to me (I'm a coconut junkie) and it's actually a decent lightweight moisturizer. I started using this about a month ago and I actually love it (and for more than just the smell!). It does tighten skin a bit, but not drastically. I use a tiny bit on my neck and chest every day and have seen my fine lines become much less noticeable. I use it on the backs of my thighs too and while it doesn‚Äôt make cellulite magically disappear, I think it improves the way it looks. It also just is a great lotion, keeps my skin so soft and smooth. If it weren‚Äôt so pricey I would slather my body with this stuff all the time. I do have to admit I originally bought from this brand because the packaging is just so dang cute. I do like the products though. The Watermelon mask has the best scent (to me at least) smells like a sour watermelon candy. Always leaves my face soft, although i wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen any difference in tone/brightness. I just got the pineapple serum the other day. So far i like it. Some reviews said this was too drying for their skin so I‚Äôm starting using it once a week and will likely build up if my skin tolerates it. Smells sweeter than raw pineapple, more like pineapple juice. Texture is very nice- not oily or sticky. My first refill came with a free order of the toothpaste so that‚Äôs why i tried it. It‚Äôs a fine toothpaste, the smell and flavor are minty but not too overwhelming. I personally prefer gel toothpastes over paste so i likely won‚Äôt order this again. But all in all it‚Äôs a good toothpaste, and gets the job done. i‚Äôve tried the toothpaste and i wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, i believe they got a new formula but i haven‚Äôt tried the new one. Personally, the quip toothpaste is my favorite toothpaste. It's not overly strong, it doesn't foam up so much that you have to spit constantly, and I like how easy it is to get the toothpaste out of the bottle They definitely receive a lot of hype due to their aesthetic but i also believe they have quality products. How I built this has a cool episode with the founder. I find most of their product underwhelming but their packaging and instagram following is impressive. I used to love their daily shield spf until I realized it doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äògood‚Äô spf ingredients like zinc or titanium. It‚Äôs really my holy grail. I love TJ rose toner! I can't wear moisturizer under my makeup (oily skin) so I use this. It has glycerin so it's just enough moisture and gives a nice finish. Great price too, can't beat it. Glad I'm not the only one who tinks it's wonderful. Thanks for sharing your routine too. Because the Ordinary cannot compare to most higher range products. 


I also don‚Äôt use The Ordinary because everything I‚Äôve tried either breaks me out, pills like crazy and has way too much silicone...it just does not compare to the products I use. 


I do use the glycolic toner all over my body but not on my face. 


The Ordinary is great for what it is. Affordable skincare. But most their products are entry level. NIOD has much better options. I have been exposed!! I love their leave in hair mask too. Dont let them kill your vibe. Water Cream is for real some HG-level stuff. I adore it. What‚Äôs your skin type!? I‚Äôm typically oily but now feeling more combo...and I‚Äôve had my eye on this for awhile  Freaking love this product too. Is it worth the hype? I want to try but it‚Äôs quite expensive Only been using it for two weeks but i wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen much difference in firmness. At the very least it‚Äôs keeping my skin hydrated. Probably won‚Äôt repurchase. No, i have not. It‚Äôs very fragranced but hydrating. I use it as a setting spray for a dewy finish. It broke me out so I gave it to my friend and she loves it. Hi! Happy to. 

This is my first bottle of milky jelly and i am debating if I‚Äôll repurchase. I used cera ve cleanser before and it‚Äôs almost the exact thing imo. It‚Äôs a nice cleanser though. 

I love Solution. Comes after my cleanser so it makes sure i don‚Äôt leave any makeup on and has improved my tone and texture of my skin. 

I have a schedule just to make sure i don‚Äôt overwhelm my skin with strong products. I use my GlowRecipe mask Sunday night as a treat to myself for making through another one. Then use my night serum the next day. I‚Äôm slowly incorporating the pineapple serum so starting at once a week. Then a few days for. The skin to settle down before the Babyfacial. And then more days to settle down

Hope that made sense :) I enjoy the actual toothbrush. A step up from my non electric one. I also love the wall mount. I enjoy the actual toothbrush. A step up from my non electric one. I also love the wall mount. I enjoy the actual toothbrush. A step up from my non electric one. I also love the wall mount. VIB hahah not even half way to Rouge.
Happy cake day! I go every other day or once a week on some products to not have them interact with each other or disrupt the ph. Everyone‚Äôs skin is different and will react different to different things. Like i put in my description- i don‚Äôt use every product every night. Most of the things on the 2nd tier are masks or serums i only use once a week. I‚Äôve only used it once so far (only using it once a week to get used to it) so i can‚Äôt really comment much on if it works. But the consistency and smell are very nice. Hi! I actually haven‚Äôt used it more than once, and it‚Äôs not part of my daily routine. It was my sephora bday gift and I‚Äôm saving it to use for travel. I haven‚Äôt used enough to know if I‚Äôd rebuy. Two different types of toners. You can‚Äôt compare them. Thayers is witch hazel and has calming and soothing properties. Witch hazel is also supposed to help with inflamed/acne prone skin (never did for me). 



Glossier The Solution is an exfoliation toner. Meaning they use exfoliating acids which will help with acne, texture, cleaning out pores, getting rid of dead skin and overall make your skin softer/supple. 


I LOVE acids. But Glossier Solution is definitely made for beginners. It didn‚Äôt hold a candle to my other acids and my texture came back. If you‚Äôre new to acids then Solution would be a great place for you to start. Haha it‚Äôs not for the face. Just body. When you start a sentence with ‚Äúnot to sound rude...‚Äù means you know what follows doesn‚Äôt need to be said. How so? The price of the products? I‚Äôm not sure why i would lie about my skin care routine, that‚Äôs rather silly. Some people have 6 eye shadow pallets that all look the same on their skin. I just prefer to splurge on skin care. Your struggle is much appreciated lol And here I was thinking you were taking a poop Haha, I thought about taking a shelfie, but I have the same mirror as you and didn't want to put in the effort üòÅ r/mirrorsforsale? Craigslistmirrors! He‚Äôs hilarious I love Milk Makeup! The cooling water stick I use day and night for eye hydration. I also will use it occasionally on a sun burn (or chemical burn- babyfacial) and it feels so nice. Not sure if it does much but does feel nice. The serum is a really nice and light day serum. It creates a ever so slightly tacky base perfect for applying makeup. I did notice after starting to use it some bumps appeared on my forehead so i no longer drag it over my forehead. Instead i apply to my cheeks nose and chin and the rub in with my hands and use what ever is left over on my forehead.

ETA: Join r/milkmakeup ! New subreddit just getting started. Added! Not OP but I use the TJ toner and I love it. My sensitive skin has started to even out (I have a lot of redness/rosacea in my cheeks and nose as well) and I find that I can use less of my facial oil and moisturizer because the toner helps to restore pH. I can't remember which toner I used before, as I had stopped doing this step in my skincare for the longest time. I do but it‚Äôs one my Dermatologist makes so you can‚Äôt get it online. Drunk elephant recommends you use marula oil after baby facial. the cosrx bha/aha clarifying toner isn‚Äôt an acid exfoliator like the baby facial is. The cosrx toner is actually a ph balancer that prepares your skin for an active so that you don‚Äôt have to wait as long after washing your face for your ph to return to normal (been using the toner for a while now) :) The one from glow is a LOT stickier I found than the Tatcha Water Cream just so you know. Another one you might like is the YTTP super-food air whip moisture cream. I find the texture to be pretty similar to the Water Cream! Seriously. I am obsessed with the scent and I feel like it keeps me hydrated. But I have not noticed any difference in firmness after using it for a month. It is basically another overpriced perfumed lotion. I will still repurchase though despite its ridiculous price üòù Genius! Haha nothing wrong with buying for the aesthetic! Thanks so much for the detailed review. I'll maybe pass on the watermelon mask if you haven't seen a huge difference! This is great news because I just ordered the watermelon mask!! [deleted] I'm not even sure it does anything dramatic for me, honestly, but I still love it. It works really well as a refresher for makeup if I feel dry. [deleted] I personally believe it is, but that price tag definitely makes it a splurge purchase for me. I notice smoother and firmer skin when I use it on my legs and arms. 

I would suggest getting a sample or the travel size before the full size if you‚Äôre going to try it, because I‚Äôve heard of people hating the smell  (I feel like people either love it [me!] or hate it) The wall mount looks incredibly convenient. Thanks for your time! Geez!

Oh yay thank you! Thank you so much!! 

Thayers just isn‚Äôt doing anything for me. I‚Äôll order the solution!!! That makes me feel a lot better and confident in ordering it! [removed] It might just be me, I'm sort of a minimalist but it's just so much it feels like overkill. but..YoU dOnT aCtUaLlY lIKe tHeM aS mUcH aS yOu sAy yOu dO. /s I don‚Äôt understand this pushback you‚Äôre getting. Some people have 15 step routines, some just wash and moisturize, you‚Äôre literally in the middle. It doesn‚Äôt seem like overkill in the least. Lol that would be a hella high toilet. Not quite that; it was specifically for people avoiding the mirror, but that's an entertaining sub too! A tip from DE about Baby Facial...mix in a few drops of marula oil before you slather it on.  It definitely helps sooth while still getting a peel effect. >r/milkmakeup

How do you find it works for eye hydration specifically? I know you can just "use your regular cream" but I find my undereyes need more attention. I love the Milk blur stick I just got, now I know to try these too! Thanks OP! I wanted to love the cooling water stick so much, but it actually managed to dry out my skin and left me with hard bumps on my skin that lasted weeks. It feels so nice going on, I wish that it worked with my skin :( Oh that‚Äôs awesome, the water stick sounds so refreshing! Awesome, thank you! Damn. Thanks anyways Omg I literally thought bha/aha was synonymous with a chemical peel solution! What's an example of an active? I didn't even know that's why one should wait for their face to dry after cleansing. 

May I ask how you incorporate it into your routine ? Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely test them out before buying. Make sure to shake before using it. The natural ingredients will start to separate. i personally look for active ingredients of  zinc oxide or titanium dioxide  OR any sunscreen on [ewg.org](https://ewg.org) lists. no glossier is on their list.

 [https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/](https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/) 

&#x200B;

 ‚ÄúThe good news is that the FDA has reaffirmed what EWG has advocated for 13 years: Based on the best current science, the safest and most effective sunscreen active ingredients are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide,‚Äù

I've had to remove your comment because it breaks Rule 1: Be kind and respectful. 

We'd like this sub to be a friendly and welcoming place. That's why we don't allow rude or hateful comments. Please be mindful of that in the future. 

This is an official warning; continuing to break rule 1 will result in a ban.

If you'd like to know more, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_1._be_kind_and_respectful.). To each their own. Thanks! Ill try that next time. I was having a problem that i hated how concealer under my eyes looked due to dryness and small bumps. I‚Äôve been using the milk stick under my eyes for almost three months now and i have no dryness or bumps under my eyes. Did not help with dark circles though. I do not use an eye cream in addition. 

Also feels so nice in the morning or on tired eyes. I place it on my eyelids as well. How do you like that? Do you use it as a primer, and can you wear it on no makeup days? I honestly thought milk sticks were such a waste of money mine dried out fast and felt like putting chapstick on my face. I do like their kush mascara though i definitely thought the same thing when i first purchased it! r/asianbeauty taught me it was just a preparer though! I use it right after cleansing and let it sit for a couple of minutes to soak in and then i follow it with either Mad Hippie Vitamin C or TO Glycolic Acid toner :) 

Actives are like Vitamin C, chemical exfoliants (Salicylic acid (bha), glycolic acid (aha)... that sort of thing!) Agreed. Some people splurge on make up or clothes. It‚Äôs no different. I hate the se little bumps under the eyes, thanks so much! I need to try this now. Thanks! I might invest in one of the smaller ones, I like the way it feels swatching it on my hand at Ulta. I use it as a primer, but on non-makeup days it's helped create a general smooth matte. I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre having to justify owning a number of products! Guuurrrllll you slather yourself in what makes you happy and live your best life! I invest in lots of different products for my skin too. It‚Äôs our largest organ and has different needs depending on our changing environment, circumstances and age. Nothing wrong with spending as much or as little of your own money as you wish on products. Thanks hahah. It‚Äôs all good though. I question people who have three cars but at the end of the day if it makes them happy and they can afford it than it doesn‚Äôt affect me. OP that is inspiring! Your skin looks beautiful.  I see a lot of shelfies on this subreddit, and a lot of them usually involve more products than I‚Äôd ever incorporate in my routine. I‚Äôve also never seen any results from said shelfies and products, but part of that is probably because I‚Äôve never gone way deep into their profiles to check on any of their progress. So here‚Äôs my shelfie with a recent picture I took in my bathroom about 2 hours ago so you can see the effects these products have had so far on my skin. 

My routine is exactly what the picture shows, AM and PM, step 1-2-3 from left to right. I honestly don‚Äôt have many pictures from when my acne was at its worst (so I‚Äôm reusing this again unfortunately), and in hindsight I wish I did, but you have an idea where I was before and where I am now with my most recent and consistent routine. Granted there were some antibiotics used somewhere along the way, but I haven‚Äôt used them in over a year now.  You have great hair Finally! A fellow Noxzema user! I love that stuff; it was the first product I ever used that actually made a marked difference on my acne. Congratulations on achieving lovely skin!  Congrats you look great!! That's a gorgeously fierce mane you're rocking there bud. Skin looks great too :) Wow you look amazing!! Fantastic!

I love seeing a shelfie that isn't 22 different products that must be ordered online and tend to be pricey with several chapters of use instructions in the text! 

You're doing great, OP! And dat flow tho...fierce. Nice hair my dude and great progress. I definitely agree; Sometimes less is what your skin prefers. I just bought noxzema! I thought I‚Äôd give it a try since the last time I used it was jr. high and it‚Äôs very affordable. It works amazingly well. I wonder why it‚Äôs not talked about more on this sub.  You‚Äôre a spunky lad, I like your glasses and hair.  I love that you use noxema. I feel like the heavens parted and saved me when I got back into it and no one else talks about it.  What a comeback.  I have the same routine. Different brands but yeah, essentially the same. Good shit man, lookin good  This is awesome to see because I feel like I can relate strongly to this philosophy. I accidentally forgot to bring my products with me on a three week trip back home so I only have a cleanser, spot treatment and moisturizer (instead of my usual 10 step routine), and I have actually been breaking out less, and my skin is less irritated! You look fantastic, well done! And that hair is gorgeous!  Nice /r/fierceflow!!!  Looking pretty xx keep it up!  Gotta love the hair!

Awesome progress too.  My mom insists that‚Äôs I try her noxema but the menthol smell makes me so nervous!!  Dude, your hair is so breathtakingly beautiful. God bless you  You look great. Less is definitely more, once I started using just basics is when my skin improved so much.  Your skin looks amazing!! Also I love that benzoyl peroxide gel it is honestly the best it cleared up my skin tremendously!  Definitely a difference, love the hair homie. Cetaphil is the shit Amazing skin! You're doing great.  Btw I'm in love with your hair!! That is so amazing! I will have to try it myself! I‚Äôm jealous. That‚Äôs amazing  Hey! I've seen you on r/fierceflow

What a difference on your skin! Well done.  Serving serious skin and hair in the second picture! Great job OP! This is SO inspiring!!!! I‚Äôm legit buying my skincare stuff on credit cards ;( I should also go back to the basics, my skin does great either way I just love anti-aging routines, but my wallet would thank me lol. I love that clean‚Äôn‚Äôclear so much though - you look amazing now! ‚ô° Drop a hair routine as well, friend.  As someone who can only afford drugstore products, this makes me so happy! Your skin and hair both look amazing!! :-) I love the persa-gel 10, I recently repurchased after it irritated my skin in high school once (it doesn't at all now, for some reason), and it works wonders. Edit: I love gentle cleansers now that can safely remove my eye makeup in one go, but this is making me want to try noxzema again, too. Hmm.  Great results! I think you need a bit more SPF though.  Wish I could get away with such a simple routine!

I've actually stripped my routine down quite a bit, what with a recent breakout probably due to a combination of my exfoliating toner and my imminent period. It feels amazing to minimize, although I'm a product junkie. Hey!! You go to UH! Wow Your skin looks great! Not to mention your hair is fabulous  Wow!!!  You've got wild style! Iove your look in the second picture. The hair is bitch'n lets talk about that majestic hair, though. loreal better hit you up cause I'm interested to know what you do to it for that volume! Your skin is so nice and your hair too and your glasses üòä please use sunscreen  I haven't used noxema in a long time. Good job op, you look great! I bet it feels much better. :) [deleted] Have you done anything new though? I remembered your face from a B&A posted a few weeks ago. Checked and you still have the same exact routine. I'm unsure of why there is a second post with the same content?

*never mind, missed the part about this including a shelfie picture of the products.  My dermatologist told me that Noxzema clogs your pores. Ever since then I switched to an oil-free face wash and my skin has been better!! Just passing that along!   Looking good!!! how do you keep the peroxide from bleaching clothes and hair?  only spot treatment? This is so inspirational!! I think I remember seeing that before picture on this sub before! Does the Noxzema foam up at all and have you tried the Noxzema Daily Deep Pore Cleanser? damn son! good for you!!  [deleted] it‚Äôs a lot to juggle but I‚Äôll try to start incorporating it in my routine Does anyone know if this routine would be suitable for early forties sensitive skin?
My wallet could really use a simpler routine.  no capes! No problem :) is it anything specific you use to make it like that?  Wow your skin looks amazing! Congrats on the gorgeous face haha  Looks amazing!  A good tip... try using glycolic acid peels once a week. It's great for acne scars. And exfoliating with microdermabrasian scrubs once a week. Followed by moisturizer so your skin doesn't create more sebum of its own. A moisturizer that's closest to your owns skin natural oils. A very good product line that's really affordable is The Ordinary. THE BEST! If you do this skin care routine you'll have the smoothest skin ever but also quite thinner right after treatments so sunscreen is very important. It really helped me get that perfect flawless skin.  Why do you post another B&A when you done that 40 days ago?

Edit: Bring on the downvotes.  You have better hair than me and you‚Äôre a man, what [removed] Smile!! Agreed, totally inspiring! I remember seeing one of OP's posts like a year or 2 ago reaching out.. now look at that glowing skin! I feel the same way when looking at other people‚Äôs Shelfies. I thought I was the only one who had no idea what all those chemically sounding products meant or did. 

3 main things help with my skin too: 
-Microgestin (my birth control)
-Witch hazel (when my skin gets too oily)
-Moisturizer made to help fight acne and not clog pores. I‚Äôve tried three different brands and they all work well. 

I don‚Äôt know really if I‚Äôm doing it ‚Äúright‚Äù but it‚Äôs the best routine I‚Äôve found for my wallet, my time, and, most importantly, my skin. Not to mention it‚Äôs super duper easy. The birth control is probably the main thing because my two other sibling didn‚Äôt take birth control and they both had extremely bad acne for years while mine is mild at best with a few breakouts here and there. It really only gets to be bad when I stop taking my pills or when I pick at my face. 

But yeah I‚Äôve always wished I could post a Shelfie but I felt like a poser for only having two products to show.  Seeing this im just gonna get ur 3 products that you used and try them myself ive been so lost on where to start and didnt want to mindlessly throw many at all kinds of products. Thank you for this post! congratulations and thanks for sharing. But can you tell us a bit more?  

- every day use: So do you use product 1 on most of your face, then product 2 on product1 on skin and then product 3? I doubt that ... so how do you apply those 3 products? 

- What happens if you only do that once a day? 

- how long did it take till your skin got used to the products? thank you for sharing! I'm one who will never be able to deal with a lot of products either so this is inspiring. 

is the middle one for spot-treatment? or do you use it all over? I have the same routine (just different products). I use 3 things, each time and that‚Äôs it. It makes my skin happy, doesn‚Äôt stress me out and doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of time.

I feel like lots of products would overwhelm me. If we ignore body moisturizers...that‚Äôs my weakness. 

I‚Äôm so happy for you though! You look amazing and you made your routine your own. I think that‚Äôs admirable! :-) I saw some other posts about you and your skin looked great! If you don't mind I'd like to ask some questions about your routine:

Would you say you had/have dry, oily, combination, or dehydrated skin? I think I have dehydrated skin, but I've seen that my T-zone is oily and my cheeks dry.

How long did your transformation take? I don't have acne but deep pores.

Do you have any recommendations for other types of lotions/moisturizers?

Love your skin :) thanks amigo, i‚Äôm equally inspiring down at r/fierceflow too.  Here to comment this! You have amazing hair!  I bought it on instinct, I was using it and my Nana walked by the bathroom to laundry room and went... ‚ÄúI know that smell... that‚Äôs noxzema! Mother used to use that!‚Äù We had a good laugh about it. It was founded in 1920s. Quality lasts! 
Also congrats OP! Hey man, I've been looking for a good cleanser lately, and all my research has led to so far is the claim that cleansers don't really do much beyond... clean. Some cleansers clean better than others, cleaners in general are so bad at cleaning that most makeup-wearers use oil/balm/micellar water and then second-cleanse with a facewash.

I'm looking for a cleanser that makes a real difference beyond, so I love hearing about people who have had great success with cleansers. What is it about the Noxzema cleanser that really helped you out? What did you enjoy about it, and why? I looooove noxema! It got me through my teenage acne years.  Going to pick up some Noxzema on my way home today!
Do you know if it‚Äôs safe to remove eye makeup?
TIA! It's a product my mother swears by too, she used it a lot her first years in the United States. This hair trip was something else too man. I'm happy to say I went through both the rough stages of the hair journey and skin journey at the same time, as I can speak for the experiences of the goods and bads of both. According to this sub, it seems to be that it has ingredients thought to be harsh on the skin. Everyone's skin is different, however. I've tried using coconut oil, raw organic honey, Organic ACV Clay Masks but they never worked like others have raved on about. It's all about luck of the draw and I've found my ticket (for now). Maybe I haven't used it consistently enough, but it really felt like it increased the amount of acne I got, but really small ones that can easily be removed with no scars raddest aesthetic amigo come hang with me sometime Thanks amigo, the journey as an asian male is especially tough trust me lol You've just made my day! :D  aww shucks making me blush behind my screen here It seems like my hair is getting as many remarks as my skin lol. I guess I made a good decision growing it out as it fits my aesthetic and personality. It's a great feeling, I'd say if your skin doesn't become irritated that you should definitely give it a go! ahahaha thanks man, I'm glad there are some strangers on the internet who enjoy it Thanks man, my hair I feel has become a clear extension to my personality. The majority seem to agree especially when they see my previous haircuts lol. Finally gave into it after hearing first hand accounts from my friends as well. Glad I did thank you thank you, glad you enjoy my locks too give it a go stranger and lemme know how it works for ya I'm sure I've seen you on there too amigo, it's funny how these subreddits intertwine with each other haha  Thanks stranger, the journey both was quite something lemme tell ya like the title says sometimes less is more lol. thanks stranger the clean n clear is definitely a main contributor to this routine Started off with an undercut way back in the fall of 2015. When Asians grow their hair out, it turns into this porcupine asian afro which just look really bad. That's probably why you usually don't see many long haired Asian individuals, it's too painstakingly uncomfortable to commit.

With an undercut I was able to hide most the awkward stage with the top, as that's where most of the shape comes from. As it grew longer, I stopped shampooing everyday, and co-wash every other day while shampooing twice a week. The natural oils that build up give it a more natural and textured look, and help promote faster growth I feel. But I'm also Asian, so our hair does grow faster than other races at around 1-1.5 inches a month.

I've had trims in between, the most recent one being back in November when I took off about 3 inches so it looks more uniform. I'm content where I am now, I feel it fits my personality and aesthetic, and a lot of my friends and peers say the same too. Persa Gel is very good, I'm not sure if it's because it's just a BP Topical gel/cream, as it's the only one I've used, but I'm a believer in this product for sure. i might do that, especially now summer is in full effect in texas and I'm gonna be doing a lot more MUni riding in my down time. yuh yuh I'm one of those unicycle people too #gocoogs chalk another one for my hair lol, thank you raddest aesthetic compadre, appreciate the gesture thanks amigo, the hair honestly fits my look and aesthetic very well majestic is quite the compliment thank you stranger. volume? i part it against my natural part and then alternate whenever it gets flat. whatever waves you see has to do with me sometimes sleeping in a loose bun or braid lol. maybe my co-washing routine helps with volume too?  ahahaha I love how my hair is earning more praise than my skin. thanks man glad you enjoy it. it's the same routine yessir, but I've always been baffled with the amount of products in other shelfies so I thought I'd share my more minimalist one.  that's actually good question, especially with my hair being longer than usual lol. it's just a spot treatment nowadays, but I was just naturally careful when I applied it as a thin film. usually I just wear old shirts when I use it, and I tie my hair up so I'm not too concerned with bleaching lol always the hair, thanks stranger  He included pictures of the products he uses this time.  Long, beautiful hair is for everyone. Not just women. üòâ not sure why you got downvoted here lol, i appreciate this compliment and not many men have long hair  If someone isn‚Äôt asking you for advice on a facial or body feature don‚Äôt say anything. 

It‚Äôs none of your business what this person does or doesn‚Äôt do with their hair.  Hi there,

I'd like to remind you of our Rule 1: Be kind and respectful.

We'd like our sub to be a friendly and welcoming place. That‚Äôs why I want to ask you to refrain from rude or disrespectful comments here. This encompasses rudeness, trolling, and, in general, being disrespectful. Even if you feel strongly about something, please stay polite.

Thank you! 

For more information, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_1._be_kind_and_respectful.).  you're not wrong lol, you'd think with clearer skin i should be smiling all the time Can you please sure the 3 different moisturizers you've tried? (:

Edit: share** Yep! I have a lot of pricey stuff on my shelf, but I know the two things that have had the MOST beneficial effects on my skin so far are Spironolactone (it's kinda the complete opposite of birth control, but it does the same job of regulating and normalizing hormones), and witch hazel toner.

Also: My skin always clears up anytime I travel, and I *know* it's because most of my skincare shelf is back at home. I need to do a complete audit of my medicine cabinet soon. Start with a cleanser, a moisturizer, and a sunscreen. Those are the 3 essentials that any good skincare routine must have. SPF 15 like OP has isn't enough, get something with SPF 30+. Once you have this routine down for a few weeks and you're comfortable, you can start adding more things! The one thing I never fully committed to was a basic 3 step routine, especially on the moisturizer part. I used to think that moisturizer would just make my oily face worse, but it actually made my face better. I'm not OP, but I used Noxema as a teen in the '90s because I wanted Rebecca Gayheart's clear dewy skin. It's a type of medicated "cold cream" cleanser. So it isn't "layered" with the next steps; it gets rinsed off, and then you'd pat your skin dry. I remember it's great because it doesn't leave any residue behind, and it leaves your face kind of tingly and cold without feeling too tight.

If that Clean & Clear gel is anything like Clinique Acne Solutions Clearing Gel‚Äîand I suspect that it is‚Äîit dries *very* quickly, and you can use it as either a spot treatment or as a super-thin all-over layer. Either way, it would go on before moisturizer, yes. When I was starting off, I was going through a relapse and my acne was coming back. so I did all 3 products AM/PM in succession. I washed with the Noxzema, leaving it on for about 10 minutes then wash it off. Then I used the Persa Gel as spot treatment for pesky acne and ones I could FEEL forming, then followed up with the moisturizer.  

There are times when I inadvertently wash only once a day, but it I haven't had any major breakouts because of it. Occasionally I'll get a huge one on my nose or forehead, but it'll only be 2 active ones at most nowadays.

As for how long it took my skin to get used to the products, it's tough to say, I started seeing clearer skin for longer periods about a month into this routine, but I also limited my dairy consumption so that may have been a factor. I'd say give it a 7-10 days at first. When my acne was worse, it used it as thin film all over. Now I only use it as spot-treatment. It's oily most of the time, but when I start to get allergies or sick it turns into combination and dries out in patches. This transformation is actually a 1.5 year difference, but there was another period of clarity and relapse in between.

I don't actually have any recommendations for moisturizers, the Cetaphil one is the first I've actually incorporated into my routine. I've lucked out with this one since it doesn't kill my face like others have said. You *do* have fab hair! Wondering if I should sub r/fierceflow even though I‚Äôm a woman and whether the same kinda care applies to my hair ü§î ah heck, I subbed anyway! Something has awoken inside me.  Omg, I adore guys with long hair! Instant subscribe.  I am a different person now that I‚Äôve been to that subreddit. I thought cleansers didn't do much besides clean either, until I tried the Noxzema Cleansing Cream. Within a week my acne had mostly cleared up. Despite it containing eucalyptus oil, menthol, camphor, and fragrance, my sensitive skin has never experienced irritation from it. I still don't understand why it was so amazingly effective at getting rid of the acne I've had for ten years, but I'm not going to argue with it! I'd advise against using it to remove eye makeup because it will sting your eyes. I can tell you it suits you physically at the very least.
 Lol you've probably not seen me on there since I'm a girl. I just subscribe to that sub to oggle all the fine menfolk that inhabit it. But it is fun to see people on multiple subs! I love it! You should be using at least an SPF 50 sunscreen during the day. And if you can reapply it a couple of times during the day, even better. And if you can wear sun protective clothing in addition to the SPF, even better. Your skin looks great now, you should be thinking about keeping it clear and bright for years to come. You're never too young to start. Thats who you are!!! I almost stepped in your way by accident one time. Keep on rockin brother He? i'm not sure what this said, but if it was something about cutting my hair, lemme be the first to say that "high and tight" or a fade does not work for me. stylistically and with my face shape. Seconded on the moisturisers please. That stuff is originally heart medicine right? Did that worry you at all when you first started it? Thanks for the advice Which 3 have you found to be the best bang for your buck to start out with? So, Noxema isn't necessarily bad?  Agreed! I also use the Clean & Clear currently and I really like it but it is a very strong product, IMO. I use it as a spot treatment on my hormonal acne because if I use it all over, my skin starts peeling and dry patches form where I layer this stuff. So lots of moisturizer is needed after the Persa Gel, but it works! Thank you for the response! I actually had some left over Cetaphil that I haven't used a few weeks but now I'm tempted to use it again! Haha, I did the same not that long ago. Not regretting it. I didn't know I needed this If you're a dude who's always had short hair, I hope that subreddit inspired you to try growing it out at least once! Eucalyptus kills staph bacteria, on contact. Noxzema is an antibacterial wash. https://www.staph-infection-resources.com/blog/eucalyptus-oil-for-infection-support/ I‚Äôll keep that in mind. Thank you!
 Yes.  Yeah! The moisturizers I‚Äôve tried, specifically designed to help fight acne or control oil, are as followed in order of most to least favorite:

-Clean and Clear dual action moisturizer with salicylic acid
-Equate Dual Power moisturizer with salicylic acid 
-Differin Moisturizer Oil Control with SPF 30

Clean and Clear has always been my go-to, it feels great, smells nice, and absorbs quickly. I really have no complaints as it doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin and it‚Äôs pretty cheap to buy. Of the three it may be the most expensive, though I don‚Äôt remember how much it costs. I would say around $6-10 depending on where you go, and the price difference is really only a matter of a couple bucks. I use Clean and Clear every day after I‚Äôve used Witch hazel. I use it when I know I‚Äôm going to be inside and when I‚Äôm going to bed. 

Equate is basically the same thing as Clean and Clear except that for some reason it doesn‚Äôt smell as good and it doesn‚Äôt seem to absorb as quickly into my skin. I only use it when I‚Äôm at my boyfriends house because it‚Äôs the only available. I would still buy Clean and Clear any day. Knowing that Equate is an off-brand company I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a couple bucks cheaper than Clean and Clear. 

I bought Differin when I heard that SPF helps prevent dark spots and acne scars. I went to Walgreens with that in mind and low and behold they had just the thing. I would say it costs about $10 as well but it‚Äôs worth it. I only use it before I‚Äôm going outside, after I‚Äôve used my witch hazel, so that the sun doesn‚Äôt cause any dark spots. My only complaints are similar to those of Equate; I don‚Äôt care for the smell (it smells like sunscreen, no surprise there) and it takes a while to absorb. Probably the longest of the 3. But it seems to work well as I don‚Äôt develop as many dark spots as I did before. 

TLDR; Clean and Clear is the best of the three, but if you‚Äôre in a pinch for money use Equate. If you don‚Äôt want to develop dark spots use Differin. Or use Differin before going outside and Clean and Clear before bed if you can afford it. 

Also, I use Dickinson‚Äôs Witch Hazel to remove dirt and oil from my face daily. I don‚Äôt usually use it more than twice a day and it keeps my skin clear of breakouts. I always use one of the three moisturizers once I‚Äôm done with Witch Hazel.  It's used to treat high blood pressure, yes, and it's also an androgen blocker. I had high DHEA-S, which is common in PCOS, and that was causing some serious hormonal breakouts (among other problems). *Conveniently enough*, I also had hypertension! So now I have clear skin *and* normal blood pressure. Science!

But you're right, and that's an important consideration that I wouldn't've remembered to mention. Yes, you're absolutely correct. Spiro can be dangerous, particularly in higher dosages, for people with normal-to-low BP. It's definitely something to discuss with your GP, and something to closely monitor if you're at all concerned. I just started it about 6 weeks ago. I have to take it at night because otherwise I will get too lightheaded. I actually already have low blood pressure naturally, and I was mildly worried, but I haven't noticed any changes even after several months on 100mg of spiro daily.  For cleanser and moisturizer, I'd recommend Cerave. It's a pretty basic drugstore brand that a ton of people have found success with. I personally use the hydrating cleanser and their general moisturizer (it's the one in the tub). Sunscreen is a bit more tricky because it can vary so much from person to person based on skin color, skin type, whether one wears makeup, etc. You should look at the sunscreen post in the sidebar for recommendations! Well, let's see. Eucalyptus can irritate sensitive skin, and camphor is toxic if ingested, which is why there's a warning on the side of Vicks VapoRub telling parents to not stick it up their kids' noses. Noxzema also contains propylene glycol, which is an unpopular ingredient all around, given its unearned notoriety for being an ingredient in antifreeze.

Here's a [breakdown of all the ingredients](https://www.livestrong.com/article/136459-noxzema-ingredients/) in Noxzema. That list suggests that Eucalyptus is included merely for fragrance's sake, while [this other list](https://www.healthboards.com/boards/acne/725794-noxzema-original-really-good.html) suggests it may actually serve as an antiseptic.

But if you google "is Noxzema bad for your face," as I just did, it turns out plenty of people swear by Noxzema cold cream for healing acne and for brightening. If it doesn't actually irritate your face, and if you don't eat it, it's probably harmless. Someone else might disagree with that, though, and that's a-ok That's news to me but explains why it cleared up the big cysts on my forehead when I was a teen. My mom used it and besides the bars of soap everyone else used it was the only thing in the house. 

Later, when I had some adult acne, I was completely loyal to Clearasil Daily Face Wash with Triclosan. 

I'm sure it was the antibacterial properties of both these cleansers that did it for me. Okay thank you once again for all the help! lol, I'll try not to ingest it, thanks! Actually, it seems to have carcinogens in it, so maybe I'll just pass.... Oh, [this Livestrong link](https://www.livestrong.com/article/183752-what-are-the-dangers-of-noxzema/)? Hmm, that's bad. I‚Äôm looking for more info. I found [this fact sheet](http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/ammonium-hydroxide), but it‚Äôs light on explanation.

Ok, here we go: "[may be a weak mutagen](https://www.bibra-information.co.uk/downloads/toxicity-profile-for-ammonium-hydroxide-1995/)." It *is* a common [food additive](https://www.foodinsight.org/Questions_and_Answers_about_Ammonium_Hydroxide_Use_in_Food_Production) here in the US, but that isn't necessarily heartening news either.  From Livestrong: The product contains stearic acid, which, among other things, is also used in the production of plastic. It is combined with triethanolamine which can irritate the eyes and cause problems with the body's endocrine system. Noxzema also contains a carcinogen: ammonium hydroxide. According to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, carcinogens may cause cancer. Propylene glycol is another toxic ingredient in Noxzema.  :( Solid routine. All it‚Äôs missing is sunscreen and you will be golden! **Skin type - Oily/Acne/Dehydration prone**

* **CeraVe Foaming Cleanser - Used AM and PM -**
*My favourite cleanser for oily skin, foams nicely, leaves skin feeling clean but doesn't  dry it out*
* **Kikumasamune High Moist - Used AM before Clinique -**
*Extremely thin consistency so have decanted it into a spray bottle to use like a toner. Contains ceramides and a bunch of other beneficial ingredients and is a HG over at AsianBeauty, i use in the morning as it is super light weight under my moisturiser and boosts hydration.*
* **Hada Labo Premium - Used PM before Clinique -**
*This is similar to the Kiku but slightly thicker, another HG over at AsianBeauty, instead of ceramides it has 5 different types of HA and 5% Urea. As it is slightly thicker i use at night underneath my moisturiser to boost hydration and plump my skin as i sleep.*
* **Ordinary Niacinamide 10% Zinc 1% - Used instead of Kiku 2-3 times a week in the AM-**
*For me this product works well to reduce redness, even skin tone and heal acne.*
* **Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Gel - Used AM and PM -**
*My all time favourite moisturiser for oily skin, not like other moisturisers for oily skin i have tried that are 90% water and have no real benefits, this actually feels like it does something, it is packed full of non pore clogging, beneficial ingredients, has a nice creamy/gel consistency and once it goes onto your skin makes it feel so soft and protected.*
* **Stridex - Used before Hada Labo 2-3 time a week -**
*A HG from this subreddit for being cheap and effective, formulated correctly so the PH is at the suitable level to be work as intended, unlike other brands that mess up the PH level so the salicylic acid cant actually do its job, this product helps to keep pores/blackheads clear aswell as treat and prevent acne and CC's*
* **Ordinary Azelaic Acid 10% - Combined with Clinique in the AM when i use Niacinamide + Zinc -**
*This is my newest product so my knowledge is very slim, however from what i have read it takes a little longer to work than other actives but eventually will help to reduce bumps, redness, uneven skin tone and acne. (essentially a combination of Stridex and Niacinamide + Zinc).*  Hada Labo Premium is my jam! I use it day and night. I love this stuff. BRO WHERE THE FUCK YOUR SINSCREEN AT That Clinique moisturizer is amazing!! :) How do you like the stridex pads? I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre awesome I just started a routine thanks to this sub as well and this is VERY close to what Im doing. That toner is the SHIT. I loooove that Clinique moisturizer! Odd question, is the hada labo label part of the protective plastic seal that lets you know if the product has been tampered with/opened? Hack: If you have the Kikumasamune toner and an empty TO Glycolic toner, the TO one's pointy twist cap fits perfectly on Kiku's bottle. :) Makes pouring the toner so much easier instead of using original pump! I see Kiku, I upvote üíï I changed from the foaming Cleanser to the Hydrating Cleanser and feel it‚Äôs much more gentle and nourishing for my dehydrated acne prone skin. Great routine!! I'd definitely invest in a good sunscreen next If you shave your face, try Cremo. I wouldn't go back to the regular stuff. Much less drying, feels like moisturizer, with a mild citrus-y scent. Also, doesn't leave a ring around the sink, or gunk up your razor. Available at Walmart, along with the Stridex red, and Cerave products. That's so cute. Love seeing people getting healthy skincare routines thanks to this sub I actually had my eyes on two of those products! The pink one, and the yellow one right next to it :) I thought they both served the same function though ... is there a difference between them or do you just like to use both alternatively? Malezzzzzzzzzzzz I am 22 yo male too. Still testing products to find the best ones for me. Hopefully will share a shelfie soon! I LOVE that face wash Forgive me for not knowing the names, but I own the pink and yellow bottles and my face has never been more soft and smooth. I use the  neutragena naturals lines; moisturizer, facial cleanser and makeup remover as well and occasionally  but I can attest to both working! *asspats here* Can someone inform me a little bit on the ordinary line? I keep seeing it omg im jealous (21, m) i definitely wanna get some of the Ordinary stuff, and cerave!! i also wish i had better access to asian skin products too, some of my friends have some great stuff I see ‚ÄúThe Ordinary‚Äù on a lot of shelfies...does anyone have any info or advice regarding their products? I‚Äôm new to this sub so please forgive my lack of knowledge WHY ARE WE STILL PROCLAIMING GENDER ON SHELFIE POSTS??????????? FOR THE KARMA?????? Oh I use the same golden bottle essence! How do you use the stridex pads? Aren't srtidex pads wonderful for spot treating? We use some of the same products! I see you don‚Äôt use the niacinamide every day, I found TO niacinamide to be very drying so I mix it 50/50 with the hada labo premium and am able use it every day. love that lotion from clinique. only thing that doesn't leave my face an oil slick Hey I use that moisturizer too. I was always biased against clinaiaue because it has some of those disapproved of ingredients in it but so far I've had no issues.. Another comment about sunscreen. Get some. :) 44f and I‚Äôm laughing at how many products we have in common. What do you think of the smell of the sake ferment? Been on the fence for the longest time about the kikumasamune. This post finally pushed me to get it! Excited to try it! Please consider adding a sunscreen in! I recommend the Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk. 

Out of curiosity, what does the Clinique DD do for the skin? I loved the feel of the Moisturising Lotion+ and used a whole tube of it but then didn't feel like it was worth repurchasing as I wasn't sure it was really *adding* anything for my skin. It also didn't help that it's poorly reviewed on Beautypedia lol! Anyone from Portugal can give any tips?
I can't find barely any of these products.

Oily skin btw Hi. For how long does that Clinique gel last you, if used 2 times a day? yo, thanks for posting! definitely gonna look into these! I'm a twenty-something male with the same skin type! Kikumasamume burnt my arm's skin. I have never done a test patch before and I'm glad I had the reflex to do it this time ): Where did you get the stride from in UK? The clinique cream is a waste of money, I get you want a good moisturiser but there are much better out there that will be non comedogenic to - Definitely need suncream - la roche posay if you have dry sensitive skin or helio care if you have oily skin! Grwat shelf!

Everyone is screaming sunscreen, so I would recommend to use the Clinique for Men Broad Spectrum SPF 21 moisturizer. I'm currently using it and so far am happy how it leaves my skin. He‚Äôs got a super thick beard (clean shaven though), but gets these crazy big ingrown hairs. I call them hair horns-they‚Äôre like 10 hairs with a sheath around them. Doesn‚Äôt help he‚Äôs constantly digging around in his face so he‚Äôll have weeping open wounds from pulling out the ingrown hairs. It definitely looks as bad as it sounds. Technically the sunscreen will prevent him from being golden! Definitely agree....sunscreen is soooo important!! [deleted] Sunscreen! I love my kikumasamune high moist. While it‚Äôs thin I‚Äôve found it to be powerful! My skin is sensitive and goes from oily to dry in a snap so I‚Äôve had to find a good balance. I put two layers of the kikumasamune at night followed by 100% squalane oil and in the morning the kikumasamune is the only moisturizer I use and it works wonders. I love the Clinique moisturiser too!

I've tried using the ordinary niacinamide once a day and it just seemed to make me break out. Do you think it works better less frequently? Using any kind of acid during the  day is even more reason to use a sunscreen. Using a sunscreen will do a LOT to reduce redness and post-acne pigmentation very quickly. I‚Äôm ready to try a few new things. Where do you all buy the Hada Labo and the Kikumasamune? The Ordinary is the life saver Do you know what the difference is between this and the regular one? How much do you use and when in your routine? I've been using it for a few weeks and I don't really notice a difference other than I think it might be breaking me out. What's your skin type? Where do you purchase it? So good, no complaints and would be lost with out them. Has anyone found a dupe that isn‚Äôt as expensive? This was my HG moisturizer as a teen but it‚Äôs so hard to afford. Same!!!!! Yes! Yeah, I ended up ripping like half the label off on accident as a result Is this a shaving cream? My husband has terrible beard issues. I‚Äôm trying to come up with a routine for him. One tube of Cremo also lasts forever! My boyfriend and I share a tube of the coconut mango scented cream, and it lasts for months [deleted] They're affordable products with simple packaging/branding. Most of the products just focus on a particular ingredient, so it will be Salicylic Acid or Retinol by Percentage rather than 'Blemish perfecting lotion' or 'Age defying wrinkle formula' for the product name. It can be confusing at first to know what you need because you need to understand what ingredient does what, but if you know what you want your getting exactly that, not paying for pretty packaging/branding and getting a bunch of different ingredients you don't necessarily need. 

There's some guides out there for it, or if you have a shopfront somewhere they're quite helpful if you tell them what you're after. But once you know what ingredients work well with your skin it's just a great way to get exactly what you want for a good price. So I'm new to this whole thing and I was reading up on the Ordinary website and I found a spot you can send a message to ask for routine help. So I sent them my list of skin concerns and goals and a picture of my face and someone wrote back with a whole AM and PM regimen for me personally. It was so nice! Oh and I spent like $35 on everything. Fantastic products! Definitely read up on them because they can be confusing and to be able to find something that exactly suits your needs! My favorite product from them and I think a lot of people can agree is their Caffeine Solution. Great for under eyes and when they‚Äôre puffy/dark. They‚Äôre worth the hype and SUPER cheap!! I live in the UK, i use the site YesStyle. The Hada Labo + Kiku cost me ¬£28 free shipping to UK and took a little over a week to arrive :) All of that can be found on Amazon (if USA). I think saying your gender (esp if your male) is helpful to reducing stigma around skin care. there is still a big thing around men and skin care, the other day i mentioned it to my colleagues and they were like "YOU USE CREAM ON UR FACE WHAT WHYY" It‚Äôs helpful if you work for Cerave. Second one I‚Äôve seen in the past couple of days. The last guy had Cerave as 4/5 of his products What‚Äôs the issue if people do? Try exfoliation (with a scrubby cloth/sponge/brush), daily if possible, and use salicylic acid on the ingrowns. It will help them get toward the surface themselves so no digging needs to happen. I got a pair of super pointy tweezers on Amazon to help grab the hairs. There are lots of shades of gold! How so? Red part I get. Just curious if you meaning acne scarring or acne in general. That sounds like an ad in the best way possible. Definitely interested in trying it now TO niacinamide makes a lot of people break out, while for others it‚Äôs a holy grail. 
It seems either your skin tolerates it or it doesn‚Äôt.  Sorry! The niacinimide made me breakout out as well, however, it made my skin look great so I kept using it. I found if I used a TINY drop of it and mixed it with my retinol serum I got the benefits I was looking for with no break outs. Try using a drop every other day! I used it twice a day, which i often do with new products and then work back. I used it twice a day for a few weeks with no issues, are you sure its breaking you out? do you spread it in evenly? Amazon Both the regular and premium have hyaluronic acid, but the premium contains urea. Urea is so moisturizing and it has exfoliating properties. One of my favourite ingredients in skincare! This one has  5 sizes of HA molecules (I think regular has 3) and the premium also has 3% urea. My skin is oily but otherwise normal (no acne or hyper-pigmentation). I use less than a dime size amount on my whole face. I basically use this as an every day moisturizer since my skin doesn't need much in that department. I don't expect noticeable differences from a HA moisturizer except that it moisturizes. I use this after I cleanse, tone and treat my skin. Basically the last step. Amazon Amazon I typically purchase during warehouse sales for less than half of retail price.

Perhaps you can check if there are any in your area? In the US, GWP runneth over. This is an example of the best deal you can get in the year end period. [From the queen of GWP blogs](https://icangwp.com/2018/10/28/unboxing-my-16-piece-clinique-bonus-from-clinique-usa/)

Alternatively, get a Black Friday 'doorbuster' from your preferred department store and add the holiday blockbuster for great value. Are you in The US? Whew, thought it meant I got a fake. Was nervously zooming in on people's images of hada labo lol Yes. https://www.amazon.com/Cremo-Original-Astonishingly-Superior-Shaving/dp/B009WQH8SA?th=1    
What kind of beard issues? Ah cool, thank you! I can't wait to try them out myself. Can you link the spot here? That's great! Where did you manage to get stridex from in the UK, I haven't seen them in ages? ill look into that thanks for the reply! well, the closest i can get (and use) is amazon UK, and not all the cool stuff from amazon USA is on the UK one saddly Lots of Amazon listings suffer from fake products and fraudulent listings, though. That's one reason I haven't yet taken the plunge into Japanese skin care, even though I'm really interested in it. I love seeing what dudes use for their face. I think it def encourages other guys what to try. 

I feel like some people try too hard to be offended ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was about to down vote this reflexively, when I realized that I was actually trying to downvote your colleagues and life doesn't work that way. Thank you! Anything specific to use for exfoliation or just a wet cloth? I appreciate the advice! The non-cancerous shade is my favorite! I hope it works for you if you try it! My skin hasn‚Äôt liked a whole lot of products I‚Äôve tried but it‚Äôs taken to this one well. I pump two or three pumps on a cotton pad and dab it on my face. And the best part is that it‚Äôs like $15 for that big bottle so it lasts for a long time. I‚Äôve been using mine for a month and less than a quarter is gone. It does literally nothing for me. So weird. From what I‚Äôve read niacinamide can cause purging but it very well might break people out. Just figured I‚Äôd mention it just in case it helps. Thanks for this tip, I've had problems with the niacinimide and thought the product would end up being left to collect dust, this gives me hope! Oops I use 3 every day lol am I overusing it üëçüèº Thanks! Ideally HA should work for me, I'm just struggling with breakouts all of a sudden and I was thinking it could be that.  After using TO HA I broke out, but again I'm not completely sure it was that Yup! I tried but it's not quite where you need to go. After this link click on Products + Regimens then What should I use?

Definitely true but I know amazon pursues those folks. If it is shipped from America you at least know you have recourse. It depends how sensitive his skin is, but something rougher would work better, like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HGJ3JDJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_zhWWCb45X2S3A) or one of those rough cloths you can find along with loofahs and stuff at the drugstore. (Just make sure it fully dries between uses to prevent mildew.) Where do you buy your kikumasamune at? I've liked the squalane I've been using, so maybe it'll be good for me too! If you are near an outlet, check if they have a Cosmetic Company store. They sell brand name skincare and makeup for half the price and sometimes even more discounts. They have Clinique and I got the gel there for $12 for the biggest bottle they had.
Otherwise, you can try the Walmart version of the lotion. 

[Equate Beauty Strikingly Unique Moisturizing Lotion](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Strikingly-Unique-Moisturizing-Lotion-4-2-Oz/1863496). It‚Äôs around $7. I order it on amazon. I know it‚Äôs a mixed bag when you order from there but so far I‚Äôve never had an issue with anything I‚Äôve ordered. Just make sure the seller has good ratings and the more ratings the better. Would you say the Wal Mart version is close in quality to the Clinique? I got a sample of the Clinique and I really liked it,  but I‚Äôm always  down for saving money haha Where would you find this because from what I‚Äôve seen that line has been discontinued. I was really hoping to try their dupe for take the day off Yes it is very similar even when it comes to ingredients. Not sure what happened, I thought they still make them. I forget where I saw it but there were quite a few people unhappy because they had a whole line that duped clinique‚Äôs basically replaced them they were apparently so good as far as how they worked and the ingredient list. 

It‚Äôs probably just like any other thing that actually works, or does well, remove it because it cuts into their other sales. Too bad! It was really a good dupe. **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

I have this but In black! Keeps my nightstand so organized lol love it so much! **Skin Care Routine**

**Skin type:** oily/acne-prone ‚Äì Preparing my skin for Accutane & trying to get rid of some hyperpigmentation.

**Makeup Removal**

‚Ä¢Bior√© Cleansing Micellar Water ‚Äì It has a funny smell, but it works great for removing mascara & gel liner.

‚Ä¢Palmers Oil Cleanser ‚Äì I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Gets rid of my makeup almost instantly and it dissolves with water, so it is super easy to clean up.

**Cleanser**

‚Ä¢Spectro Cleanser ‚Äì Very gentle cleanser. 10/10 would recommend

**Toner**

‚Ä¢Thayers Witch Hazel Toner (Original) ‚Äì Love this. Smells great and it really soothes my skin

**Moisturizer(s)**

‚Ä¢St. Ives Renewing Moisturizer ‚Äì I like using this if I get home midday and I don‚Äôt want to do my night routine

‚Ä¢CeraVe PM Moisturizing Lotion ‚Äì I use this one at night ‚Äì usually after the Tactum pump.

‚Ä¢Cetaphil Oil Control Moisturizer SPF 30 ‚Äì It has a little bit of a white cast, but it goes away within a minute or two. Smells heavily like sunscreen, but I really enjoy it.

‚Ä¢TactumPump (adapalene - benzoyl peroxide) ‚Äì I use this as a spot treatment. My dumbass did not listen to other Redditors and my face looked like it got slapped by Jesus and his hands were cheese graters.

‚Ä¢Cetaphil Moisturizing cream ‚Äì Very thick moisturizer; great for those days where the weather is really harsh and my skin needs more hydration

**Oil/Serum**

‚Ä¢Palmers Eventone Tone Correcting Face Oil ‚Äì Great for calming my skin down! I haven‚Äôt used it long enough to notice a difference in hyperpigmentation.

‚Ä¢Clinical Series Glycolic Hydrating Serum - Got it this weekend! Not so sure how it‚Äôs going to turn out.

**Masks**

‚Ä¢Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay ‚Äì This really works! I enjoy using it with apple cider vinegar and I can really see a difference on my skin after using it. Word of caution, your face will appear red right after using it, but it usually goes down within 20 minutes from me.

**Lips**

‚Ä¢Lush Lip Scrub in Cookie Dough ‚Äì This is like crack... Smells great, tastes even better and it does a great job at exfoliating lips!

‚Ä¢Vaseline/Carmex ‚Äì Very moisturizing! I like using Vaseline at night and Carmex during the day.

**Morning routine**

Spectro Face Wash ‚Äì Thayers Toner ‚Äì Vitamin C ‚Äì Cetaphil Moisturizer 

**Evening Routine**

Spectro Face Wash ‚Äì Thayers Toner ‚Äì Tactum Pump ‚Äì CeraVe Moisturizer ‚Äì Retinol & Glycolic Acid

&#x200B;

I do not use all of these products at once - I like rotating them :)

Thank you! I need it üòç Did this really get 3k upvotes..? What could you *possibly* need with all that? You could condense that into like 4 or 5 products and still get the same results. It‚Äôs borderline hoarding at this point. It really is!! Although I spend a stupid amount of time organizing it and reorganizing it.. I have two of these (one for makeup on my vanity and one for skincare/nailcare in my bathroom closet) and they are awesome!!! They fit so much stuff! Highly recommend! I had this and every time I would spin it everything would fall off lmao :( Same! I bought a pink one! This is amazing. What did you search for? Rotating shelf? I need one, time to hop onto Amazon. Same! I got a clear one and it‚Äôs so great, you can fit so much on it in a nice way. Nice! [Found it on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/771685916/rotating-makeup-organizer-360-degree?ref=listings_manager_grid) for pretty cheap too :) Ugh I wish I could pull off some black in my room!! I bet it looks bomb!! Link? ironic that you rotate them hahah Thanks! That‚Äôs actually a link to your order history though so it only works for you! for the cetaphil oil control moisturizer spf 30 you mentioned that it smells like sunscreen, but isn‚Äôt spf the same thing as sunscreen? Ohh that sounds so nice!!! Do you have any pictures of it? :) I have a double topper type like that one. I have 2 similar to what the OP posted, but they aren‚Äôt spacious for tall things. That is so awesome üòÇüòÇ That is so much storage!!! Please share a picture üò± I have been trying it for a week and I can already see a difference! I'm also Western European so my under eye bags look more like black eyes üò≠ It's so freaking useful I didn‚Äôt even know amazon made bamboo ones!!! Do you ever worry about oils eating through the wood?? Amazon and reddit do that to you üòÇüò≠ Amazon usually has different versions of this. I got mine on amazon!!! Check out Facebook Marketplace first. Wouldn't surprise me if people had similar options available even if they are not technically for skincare or beauty - you can get rotating towers for anything like spices and bottles. Amazon gets me in to much trouble üòÇ hopefully it gets you in trouble now as well!! It fits quite a lot, surprisingly! There is still a lot of free space and I can fit about 2 more moisturizers and maybe 3 serums/oils! That is also not counting a whole shelf I have on top of my cleanser. I definitely recommend you give it a go ‚ò∫Ô∏è It is so great!! 23 cm or 9 inches!! I keep it on top of my vanity and it does not take much space Thank you!! It‚Äôs a nifty little thing! It‚Äôs definitely worth biting the bullet!! Omfg thank you!!

GET IT!! üòàüòà You should get one üòà Honestly, it took me a couple of tries to get everything to fit right, but now it is so easy to get ready!! üôèüèª You should get it!! üòç My skin isn‚Äôt exploding as much anymore which I really like. However I still need to go on Accutane because it has never gone away üò≠ I‚Äôm so happy all of the products are working for you üôèüèªüôèüèª It‚Äôs such a nifty little thing!! Isn‚Äôt It though? I have so much more vanity space now üò± You most certainly do!! I‚Äôm obsessed! Definitely going to buy it again when I run out 360 rotating cosmetics box!! They are so stinking useful!! I could spin it like a mofo and everything would stay there!! It‚Äôs very well built You‚Äôll love it!! üòç Do you have pictures?? I‚Äôd love to see what the black one looks like GET IT!! It is honestly so great!! I don‚Äôt regret it one bit Best description I have heard üòÇüòÇ You definitely do!! Great minds think alike üòçüòçüòç Amazon!! Amazon!!! You should get it!! üòçüòç Yay!! So happy you got one ü•≥ they are so useful It's very possible!! Ikea is very dangerous for me though üòÇ [Canadian Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07RXJXNDL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Omfg that is such a nice compliment!!! üò±üò±üò± I have a clear acrylic one too - I like that it came with organizers for the top, more places to store stuff! I‚Äôll try to get a pic. 

I have a clear acrylic makeup organizer (cubes and holders and drawers) on the other side of my counter. It has helped clean up my countertop so much! Now for the actual drawers... and cupboards... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was debating between the clear and the white, but I ended up picking the white cause it matches my room better!! Do you have pictures of yours?? Done!! Sorry about that :) xx You should definitely get it!!! üòç That‚Äôs a very fair point! I happen to enjoy all of these products and the different things they do to my skin. Some of them were prescribed my doctor and others I wanted to experiment with to see what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Although I completely get the hoarding issue, I do have my limits. Not to mention I‚Äôm also an adult who can afford them and recycles everything, so I‚Äôm not wasting any product and getting rid of them in an environmentally unconscious way! Same! Search makeup organizer on amazon and you‚Äôll get hundreds of this product. I want a clear one omg!

I tried to slide a pun in there üòÇ Oh shit!! [let‚Äôs ](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B07RXJXNDL?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image) try that again!! Yeah, they probably just mean that some items with SPF don‚Äôt smell like it. That one in particular smells like a bottle of regular body sunscreen. Exactly what @DietCokeYummie said! Some products with SPF dont have the sunscreen smell, but this one does! :) Not sure how I can upload them here I'm gonna be the devil on your shoulder and recommend you get this one üòà mine is messy. lol. here is one on [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/Organizer-Rotating-Cosmetics-Capacity-Lipsticks/dp/B07Y26TDTV/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2W3XEVQ6NUYCF&keywords=makeup%2Borganizers%2Band%2Bstorage&qid=1583636357&sprefix=make%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-7&th=1) Okay I may have to try!! But also, do you know if your dark circles are genetic? No, I screw them closed pretty well, no leaks so far.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0783QJST4/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apap_li4WQid37DRwB thank u üëçüèª It did üôÉ 
thanks for sharing! I like it and I have minimal space so that would work. Thanks! Where can I buy? Bless u üñ§ my heart says yes but my mom says no. Any little bit of progress is awesome!!! The Accutane will be worth the journey!! Hang in there üí™üèºüí™üèº

You actually taught me something about the TP. The dermatologist told me to use it all over when my skin was at it‚Äôs worst. But recently since it‚Äôs been better, I‚Äôve been getting rash like areas on my chin and neck. After reading your comment about your experience, I can definitely say that I can cut back on how much I‚Äôve been using at night because i definitely don‚Äôt need to be slathering it on like I used to. Thanks for sharing !!! awesome tysmmm Omg okay you‚Äôve convinced me üòÇ Thank you! why? u afraid of getting lost?! I wish I knew how to put a pic or boomerang up here... I love my organizer too! I keep it in my bedroom on my dresser right next to my skincare fridge - which was a Christmas gift üòÅ I have an acrylic one for (part of) my makeup. It has moulds for lipsticks on top. One of my best purchases ever. Thanks!! Your post is back up. :) Quick question - will the pixie glow tonic fit? Thanks!! That works! Thanks! yeah just the way it was worded seemed off I usually upload them to imgur and then link them to comments, but I'm not sure if you want to go through all that trouble! I‚Äôll take a picture of the 2 I have, and then the third one I got. Yours does seem taller and like it fits more.

Yeah there‚Äôs no way the Aztec tub would fit on any of the shelves, or the Thayers Why did you have to do this to me üòÇüòÇ Oh 100%! They aren't too too bad when I get enough sleep, but this has helped! You Americans have everything... üò± Oh boo, now I have to decide between the cheap $22 acrylic or this fancy pretty $46 dollar one.

Edit: the $46 bamboo also has $10 shipping. Cheap one it is! Yay!!!! Glad I‚Äôm not alone ü•≥ I got mine on amazon!! I gotchu boo üíï And puppy eyes won‚Äôt work? ü§î Oh my skin was peeling EVERYWHERE; I looked like a lizard and everything hurt! I used the palmers oil 24/7 because it was the only thing that didn‚Äôt sting. My derm said the same thing and I‚Äôm telling him it was horrible advice. I like using it just where I have breakouts and placing an acne patch on top to make sure my breakouts are dried out in the morning. 

Can‚Äôt wait for accutane and acne free skin üôèüèª thank you for your comment! Means a lot üíï Muahaha! üòàüòàüòà honestly I think you will love it!! LOL!! No I love it in there, I could spend hours looking at everything. Plus my wallet is always mad after I leave! Reddit converts into a gif (literally found this out yesterday) because r/skincareaddiction only supports images! Definitely give it a go üòç

Most importantly... HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR SKIN CARE FRIDGE?? Totally worth the $23 üëèüèªüëèüèª You can adjust the shelves up and down so I‚Äôm sure it can!!! Woot woot üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº ok since this comment has been oscillating between -7 and -5 lmao it wasn‚Äôt a personal attack against op by saying it sounded off; if the wording makes it seem like something it‚Äôs not (which she didn‚Äôt mean) then it sounds off. i didn‚Äôt want to say confusing or misleading because i knew what she meant, but it also wasn‚Äôt direct [Does this one work?](https://imgur.com/gallery/M2rghaL) [Was able to create a video (hopefully you can see it)](https://imgur.com/gallery/o5SSHx7) These are pretty great! If you ever feel like replacing them, I definitely suggest you give this a go!! Okay thank you :) I'll trade you my rotating bamboo organizer for health care! Oh no it's on sale for $23 with free shipping I like your thought process üòÇüòÇ nope Oh it‚Äôs so horribly itchy!!! I‚Äôll definitely be cutting back lol 

Keep us posted on your progress!!! Having clear skin seriously has changed my life. Its been 6 months since I saw my dermatologist and I have never been happier. I cannot wait for you to feel the same way! hehe oh yah i understand! üòÄ I think mine was even cheaper and only available for a short period of time. I‚Äôm still very happy to have it. Every one should have a tower organizer. Sorry you got downvoted :( Yes it does!! I love it :D Can you measure the height and diameter please?? You deserve all of the upvotes on reddit Link? Damn, I‚Äôm sorry :( Can I ask what your dermatologist told you to do?? Aside from summoning a demon I have tried everything under the sun. I even found out I was lactose intolerant and cutting out dairy really helped, but the hormonal acne is still there :( Canadian prices always suck... But still not mad at the $23 haha it‚Äôs ok it was harsher than it was meant to be and i get why people didn‚Äôt like it Haha Dimensions: 30 cm √ó 23 cm / 11.8 inches √ó 9 inches chill at least im not dead Of course. 

First I switched my birth control to something that was lower in testosterone. The one I was on was known for being high in it which resulted in more hormonal acne. 

Then went to a dermatologist and she prescribed me the TactaPump for night and Aczone Gel during the day. wash with cetaphil pro derma control. And moisturize with cereve moisturizing cream. I toggle between different moisturizers tho. Besides the odd red patchy spot, it‚Äôs still better than major cyst like break outs all the time. Now, I maybe get 2 tiny wee little pimples a week, they‚Äôre not even worth paying attention to, and a little bit of a break out on my chin before my period. Which is STILL better than the last 16 years of my life. This is the most confident I‚Äôve ever felt about my skin. I seriously hope you one day get to feel this level of bliss and comfort with your own üòä Uggh that makes me so happy for you!!! I hope to feel that way soon üôèüèª Hi~ when I see the picture my instinct told me that maybe this person is Malaysian and after reading your comment you really are one! Pretty cool to see another fellow Malaysian in this sub and we are also same the same age! I see that you got some ordinary products, i would really love to try the rosehip seed oil since there's so many good reviews including yours about it. may I ask which website did you get it from? Since there's no ordinary outlets in Malaysia. \[Not in the picture\]

‚Ä¢Cetaphil Cleanser

‚Ä¢Innisfree Aloe revital soothing gel

&#x200B;

Hey skincareaddicts, this is my routine for a 19 y/o asian Uni boi which have acne prone and ultra,super-duper sensitive skin. Mum always says i had too much skin care product for a boy but my skin prove her wrong

&#x200B;

\[AM\]

‚Ä¢**Cetaphil Cleanser** = The only cleanser that I've tried so far that doesn't cause redness, had yet to try Cerave in a tube since it's not readily available in Malaysia pharmacy :c

‚Ä¢**Melano CC/ TO Niacinamide** = Melano CC the day after tretinoin since I prefer the oiliness on my skin rather than gel like feeling that niacinamide gives, maybe it's a placebo effect that makes my skin feels more moisturized

‚Ä¢**Hada Labo premium hydrating lotion** = Oh my god this toner is HG for me, it makes my face feel so full and fluffy after applying and gives TONS of hydration

‚Ä¢**Innisfree Aloe revital soothing gel** = Light moisturizer that works for me and I prefer this rather than other moisturizer because it really mix well with the sunscreen

‚Ä¢**Biore UV aqua rich** = Another HG for me, cheap and doesn't gives oily/heavy feeling, I used to HATE sunscreen because most of them gives a heavy texture, but thanks to you guys, I had converted

&#x200B;

\[PM\]

‚Ä¢**Cetaphil Cleanser** = refer above

‚Ä¢**Tret 0.025/ Cosrx AHA whitehead power liquid** = Alternate between these 2, just started using 0.025% of tret and it already gave me flaky skin, guess my skin is really sensetive, just got Cosrx AHA, don't really know how to describe it

‚Ä¢**Hada Labo premium hydrating lotion** = refer above

‚Ä¢**Hada Labo premium night cream/ Cosrx overnight rice mask** = Hada Labo night cream feels really heavy for me but hey it smells good and get it's job done and I just got cosrx overnight rice mask, still at my journey to find the perfect night mask

‚Ä¢**TO roseseed hip oi**l = This stuff is AMAZING, I usually mix it with my night cream

(Innisfree jeju volcanic facemask when I'm feelin fancy, this stuff is hard to wash off so I don't really use it frequently, it really refresh my skin after a longg day)

‚Ä¢**Vaseline lip therapy original** : HG lip balm, doesn't taste like anything, doesn't gives any allergic reaction, really get its job done, can't sleep without it, preach turns out there are a lot of malaysians in this sub üòÜ Shoutout to all the Malaysians in this thread! Another fellow Malaysian here, where did you get your tretinoin prescription from? I got mine from the dermatologist but not sure what to do once it finishes üò© I think that Biore Aqua Rich has a lot of alcohol in it so might be drying you out. Check it out on cosdna.com. And if moisture is an issue try out the Laneige Skin Cream. I tried it last night and was a little startled by how rich and moist it is. It's a toner/lotion hybrid. Has anyone tried or heard of TO 100% Plant-Derived Squalane? I heard it‚Äôs also for hydration. I think it would just work the same way as how you use the rosehip though. Great job choosing. That melano cc serum is really something! Absolutely love that gem I LOVE using moisturizer and then putting TO Squalane oil over. I use a variety of oils (including rosehip) but that‚Äôs always my last one and I feel it works the best. 

Also I have heard and had great results using a little bit of aquaphor as my last step to seal in all the moisture. [deleted] Hi neighbor! I'm from Indonesia. Drop here because I agree with what some said here, I do really have trust issue purchasing The Ordinary from Shopee. Although, on the ordinary website there's one official distributor/seller in Indonesia is listed there.

And we have almost similar routine and products, except for the tretinoin. My question though, do you use tretinoin to deal with acne or anti aging? I'm thinking about using one, but a bit worried, do you use it on entire face or just as spot treatment?

Thank you! ^^ I have got four from your list but after I moved to Germany now I am forced to switch to all The Ordinary product. Although I‚Äôve never use so much of Ordinary‚Äôs before but turn out they are very good! I am kinda noob can you tell me the purpose of rosseed hip oil? I read that it‚Äôs a surface hydrating oil and I had no idea what that meant. You feel like it locks in moisture all thought your skin or just on the outside. Such good pics! Love all of these Ayyy fellow Malaysian here...I usually get my the ordinary products from a seller called oddnbeauty on Instagram...I know the seller cause she's uni mates with my sister I got a little mini jar of that Innisfree clay mask, and I'm OBSESSED with it. I've used the entire thing already. I really wish that Biore sunscreen worked for me because it has such a beautiful finish ! But I guess my skin is too sensitive for it since I would get irritation on my cheeks when using it is the retacnyl emollient? I feel the same, I also need a whole package like yours to lock in all the moisture lol Uh very nice! How are the cosrx things? Would you recommend them for normal/dry skin? Hada Labo Premium üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ How do you like the innisfree volcano mask? Do you feel like it's drying at all? That Innsifree clay mask is GOLD üåü YOOOO THAT BIORE UV SUNSCREEN IS THE BEST. Water based sunscreen, no oily feel, no white cast, great under makeup or every day look. 100% recommend Can anyone use these products? Someone has probably posted about this, but what‚Äôs the difference between American versions of Hado Labo vs Japanese? Similar regimen here. 


Wash, Hada labo fluid, cosrx 96, Hada labo gel cream, liquid gold, CeraVe in the tub, tretinoin 0.25 

Sadly, mine is not working. I've tried putting the tret before and after all the other stuff and even using it without buffering. It's been six months and my skin is not better, if anything it's worse because of drying and the occasional tret induced pimple [deleted] What is your skin type? Oily dry etc? Can someone eli5 why and how should I lock in moisture? I have the opposite problem. Cannot de-oil my face for shit. new to face game - what is exactly your step-by-step process going through all these products? Hi can I get some feedback about the white ordinary serum? I have combination skin, thank you so much I really wanted to love the Spa Rice mask but I got whiteheads every time I used it sadly... Do these products work well to moisturize. I have been trying to find good products since my skin is extremely dehydrated. Suggestions. What are those two ordinary drops good for? L‚Äôoreal hydragenius! I swear by it :) Yooooo fellow malaysians here im surprised you‚Äôre 19 and already started earlier with the actives lol. Not to mention so much products I think you may have way too muc product. Let your skin breathe. We azn man we dont need no skin care product, my skin smooth as hell and i only use water, soap sometimes when i shower. When i use some products i start getting zits so i dont use them anymore. For moisture have you tried secret strips anti wrinkles patch ? 

 [https://lierre.ca/blog/how-does-secret-strips-anti-wrinkles-face-mask-help-you-to-combat-aging-what-is-so-magical/](https://lierre.ca/blog/how-does-secret-strips-anti-wrinkles-face-mask-help-you-to-combat-aging-what-is-so-magical/) how the HELL can you tell this person is from MY from their shelfie I also thought ‚Äúis this person from Malaysia‚Äù and turned out he is!! Lol btw i got my TO products from beautybay.com Malaysian here too. I tried purchasing TO from Shopee before. Came within a week? But i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real or what‚Äôs fake for the item ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Same here, as soon as I saw the picture I immediately thought that OP must be Malaysian lmao Seconding another commenter, I also get my TO products from Beauty Bay because there are too many fakes on Lazada and Shopee :( Shipping takes ages (1.5 months or so) but it's pretty easy to qualify for free shipping. I agree, there are too many fakes so I don't really trust popular skincare products selling from lazada and shopee. I mean, how did you get a product like that so much cheaper than the original price. Thanks for telling me anyway~ OP I hope your the ordinary products are real And also OP where did you get your cosrx products from? Hermo? I highly suggest checking out Kosmea rosehip oil; I'm going to post a review soon but I have tried both TO and Kosma rosehip oil and the Kosmea is so much better. It's more expensive but the TO rosehip oil basically comes off as a watered-down version of the good stuff (lighter in colour, runnier, and doesn't give my skin the same glow/healing IMO). I've given up the TO rosehip oil because it doesn't really seem to do much for me whereas the Kosmea made me go "woahhh" whenever I used it (dry/dehydrated skin here). Malaysian here! I own like half of the products in the photo üòÅ the photo definitely smells Malaysian to me Fellow Malaysian here, you can buy The Ordinary from Lazada. I've recently purchased the ordinary lactic acid from it and I can't wait to try it out! If I'm not mistaken, there's free delivery available at the moment. Definitely a best time to purchase it now before it last. One of us! One of us! Malaysian here as well üôã A women's sixth sense Rosehip seed oil doesn't need to be bought from The Ordinary, it's a very simple product to make. I don't know the Malaysian market but I'm sure you can find an equally good one from another brand. This picture almost looks like it could have been taken from my skincare collection! I use a lot more snail products though. Have you ever tried snail? if tretinoin is making you peel, try applying it after the Hada Labo premium lotion, and wait for the HL to fully dry first. this is ‚Äúbuffering‚Äù and it can really reduce peeling and redness from tretinoin :)
I use the same HL lotion and tret .05% and never peel anymore now that I buffer! Heyo, you and I use the same Hado Labo hydrating lotion and the same Biore sunscreen! I absolutely hated sunscreens before I was recommended that one, isn't is phenomenal? Question though- I use the Hado Labo hydrating lotion as a moisturizer- is it a toner? If so I've been using it wrong this whole time, haha. > Hada Labo premium hydrating lotion = Oh my god this toner is HG for me

o this is a toner??? I've just been using it as a lotion after my regular toner Have you tried COSRX‚Äôs AHA/BHA toner? I find it not as harsh as other exfoliators and it helped to control acne. just started using the hadalabo perfect gel at night. Not sure how it's different from the one you're using, but it's been working great for me. [deleted] Selangor monkey checkin' in, r/Malaysia is leaking Kelana jaya, what bout u Selangor potato here Another Selangor potato, PJ hype! Kota Kinabalu!! Whoop whoop! Malaysian here, you can get tretinoin from AA Pharmacy or Big Pharmacy from the pharmacist counter. I don't remember seeing the brand in OP's post but you can get Tretinon which is tretinoin 0.05%. I have dry skin and I use the biore aqua riche every day for three years now, haven't found it drying at all! I always use Cerave baby lotion as my daily moisturizer and I find the dimethicone in it protects my skin from the alcohol. I'm a huge fan of aqua riche. I spent 5 months in Hawaiian and didn't get one sunburn! I use it for few years now and i think so too but i also use shitload of moisturizer. The biore works so well especially when i go to the beach, ha e to reapply every couple hours and it cheap too I use TO Squalane daily before my moisturizer after toning. I‚Äôm on Tret which seriously dries out my skin, so TO squalane makes a huge difference to restore moisture I use TO Hemi-squalane, and I love it.  I have pretty dry skin and use differen, so it helps a lot with the flaky skin.  I also mix 2/3 jojoba oil and 1/3 hemi squaline and use that as a cuticle oil.  I usually buy three bottles at a time because I don‚Äôt ever want to be without it. I've used both and didn't really notice a lot of difference between them. When both of them were half gone I ended up just mixing the two of them in one bottle and it works just the same:) I'm pretty biased toward it, my crush says that I looks more "woke" after 2 weeks of using it HAHA Greetings neighbour! I'm using tret to treat my acne, but be careful tho, first few weeks of tret for me suck lol, purging acne and redness everywhere, dont really know about anti aging tho. The only advice from me is, start slow and your skin will thank you for it, good luck! PREACH bro/sis, it makes my skin feel sooooo refreshed, pain in the ass to remove it tho haha. Might pick up my 2nd jar soon too! I did not try to mix them up, I usually use them at alternate days. Sensitive, Dry and also acne prone :C Usually dehydrated skin lacks water or sometimes products you use may dry you out (whether typed of retinol, vit. C, chemical exfoliants, etc.), when locking your moisturizer in, it helps with the flakes that may be caused when your skin is adjusting to the product and it makes your skin more supple and decreased the irritation I received out of my experience. Theres other benefits too, like how it CAN decrease the possible heal time of a scar/breakout but it's always gonna be YMMV. You use an occlusive after moisturizer, it can be aquaphor, vaseline, or some heavy oil (squalane for example). Kost people do it just at night but if I do, do it in the morning i put a drop of squalane after my moisturizer so it isnt too oily for daytime wear It's in one of my comment in the post

HERE => [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cdwhxf/shelfie\_19yo\_asian\_male\_tryin\_to\_lock\_in\_all\_the/etwq5fq?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cdwhxf/shelfie_19yo_asian_male_tryin_to_lock_in_all_the/etwq5fq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Keep in mind that OP alternates between their actives and that they also have pictured two masks + sunscreen. They don't put all of this stuff on every time they do their skin care routine. Seems fine to me, especially since a lot of it is focused on moisture which speaking personally, my skin can't get enough of:) Looked at post history, seems like this user works for this brand We can smell our kind thru the screen! I am so confused... reading comments and still can‚Äôt understand what the giveaway was üòÇ I get it from wako beauty based at Malacca, they have quite a nice shoppee, lazada and their own website which also looks pretty dope so it seems pretty legit HAHA I get it on either shoppee or lazada, but I did some background check of those seller before purchasing tho Your neighbour from across the bridge right here but I get cosrx from Hermo Not OP but if you live in KL there‚Äôs a store in Fahrenheit88 that sells Cosrx and other K Beauty items May I know the seller? Afraid of getting fakes. I have the cosrx snail mucin serum! It's wonderful! My skin looked more even and bright the morning after I first used it, I feel. Plus, a little bit goes such a long way. I've had it for a month-ish and have barely made a dent.

Edit: I would also recommend the honey ceramide moisturizer. I'm post accutane dry and it's wonderful. The consistency is really nice and I slather it on at night after everything. do you have acne and still see results with buffering? i just started tretinoin (literally tonight) and my dermatologist told me it will deactivate it? i usually buffered my epiduo....

edit: spelling (edit: im not op but still love this stuff) many japanese beauty brands refer to what we would call ‚Äútoners‚Äù as ‚Äúlotions‚Äù :) the premium one is very thick so i use it as more of a first treatment essence - if i‚Äôm using up another hydrating toner that‚Äôs thinner i‚Äôll even layer that underneath the HL premium! Watson! Petaling Jaya !! Selangorrrrrüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ayyy PJ bois Yoooo which part of selangor ? You can buy it over the counter. Guardian and watson have it (as long as that particular outlets have a pharmacist ). I bought mine from guardian. Guardian tret is the original while watson are generic. If you buy it from watson is pretty cheap. MYR 25 i think for 0.05. Guardian is around MYR 35. Btw, when i saw the OP pictures,I've thought of OP is malaysian lol. The tret is pretty much give away for me. Good to know that there's many Malaysians here in this subs. I pretty much on this sub most of my free time lol and r/asianbeauty too. The brand that I'm using is Galderma, pretty sure its quite common from pharmacy that's not from those big retail chain , watson, guardian, caring etc, just ask your friendly neighbourhood pharmacy :) If it works, it works! Keep using it. What moisturizer do you use :) I absolutely love the Squalane too What is the difference between the Squalane and the Hemi? I read tret is also effective for fine lines and anti aging... I'm not really that acne prone (only one or two suddenly show up sometimes), but I have dry skin, that's why I'm afraid it will be too drying, or make me breakout.  I'll probably start with 0.025% tret weekly then. Thank you! How many drops of squalane do u use for one side of your face? I have to use 2-3 drops to get enough to spread around. Then my face just looks oily. I use squalane at night, after applying TO hyaluronic +B5, and I get peeling. Not sure if it‚Äôs the hyaluronic peeling or my skin. lol. There‚Äôs no pain though. It‚Äôs great that he‚Äôs taking care of his skin but some times less is more. The skin needs to naturally heal at some point. Unless it‚Äôs his dermatologist who specifically prescribe him these though. And moisture for the skin can‚Äôt always be solved by putting on skin creams - take into consideration the weather (humid or dry), the environment you frequent (polluted, air conditioned, etc.), your diet, your lifestyle. Yea this looks like someonr from SEA but TO throws a bit. I wonder if people can tell other place's skincare routines? I wonder if I could tell if someone was Irish from their skincare now ü§î What's the name of the store? Man.. I'm not sure now after I read few comments about fake here. I may be naive because I've read the reviews from Lazada. The seller is Worthee Cosmetics. They have 98% positive seller ratings and 1.6k followers and their own website as well. Kinda legit I'd say :/ I had some acne when I started (but I started for anti-aging and pigmentation issues primarily) and now I very rarely break out at all - like, I got a deep lumpy pimple on my cheek last week (likely due to shoveling candy in my mouth while stressed at work) and I had to go out and buy pimple patches because I hadn‚Äôt needed to use them in months and my old ones had dried up. 

I think if you buffered with something thick and greasy it might make the tret less effective but an essence or serum won‚Äôt do that. oh gotcha! So wait. Should I be using an actual moisturizer then afterwards? thanks! The satay townüç° Subang represent! To think I paid rm75 for the same tret from a dermatologist üò©üò©üò© thanks for the heads up! Is it over-the-counter? I switch up my moisturizers now that the Tret has tamed my breakouts enough to explore new products. Lately I‚Äôve been on a Murad kick - I use either the Nutrient-Charged Water Gel or the Hydrodynamic Ultimate Moisturizer at night, and the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Day Moisturizer with SPF 30 in the morning I think its just a lighter less oily version of Squalane.  Since I use it in the morning as well as night I didn‚Äôt want anything super oily under my makeup.  It‚Äôs hydrating enough for my dry skin but light enough to put in my hair when it needs a little extra moisture . Have you tried mixing your drops into your moisturizer so itll absorb better? That's what I have to do since it's a dry oil and it takes forever to absorb without.

I put it 1-2 drops of the oil on my fingertips after I moisturize (i dont let the moisturizer fully dry) then quickly pat the oil onto my cheeks first until I know its evenly distributed then whatever oil is remained goes to my forehead as it needs less oil (I have sensitive, acne-prone, combo skin). Or you can just mix it into your moisturizer directly, but to me the first way works better for daytime wear. It still takes a bit to absorb but I noticed my skin looks more supple doing it like this and I look less like an oil slick as the day progresses once it fully absorbs. At night, I use one drop per check which makes my face more oily but that's okay since that's when I use it more as an occlusive to combat my peeling with differin. 

I also heard others said using less of squalane helped them too, like 1/2 to 1 drop per usage gave them plenty of results Also HAs are not suppose to dry out your skin, do you live in a dry climate? If so, the water its pulling is going to only pull the water on your skin and not the water molecules that are in the air/around you. I would recommend to either find another hydrating ingredient that works for you or apply the TO serum when your skin is slightly damp. Learned this from personal experience!! Use to be in Washington but moved to Nevada and HAs did not work the same unless I did it immediately after I showered/cleansed my face On rare occasions, I can tell if they're aussie by their shelfie. I guess I browse chemist warehouse and Priceline so frequently, I've familiarised myself pretty well with the products that draw me, or the ones I see on here often. Also s instead of z in their sentences. It's called Play Up Advance, they have a second branch at Berjaya Times Square. Worthee Cosmetics should be okay. They're the local distributor for Paula's Choice and the product I received was legit. However, I've received fake TO products and Melano CC from Shopee before, even though the reviews were all positive so I tend to avoid Shopee sellers if I can. thanks for all the info :-) i have to agree that i don‚Äôt see why a thin product would get in the way i would recommend one just to lock in the hydration and preventing water loss. no matter your skin type i feel like you should be using a moisturizer that conditions your skin, especially at night I live in a humid climate and I have found that the HL lotion (I use the white gokujyun one but I think it is similar) is okay alone when it is very humid during the day, but I need another layer at night or when it is less humid. So....YMMV. I treat is as halfway between a toner/essence and a really light moisturizer. What a small world Yes it is! Yeah I apply HA right after I finish my shower, when face is damp and toilet still steaming. I think I shall not let it absorb and dry before applying the squalane. I‚Äôll follow your method about mixing the 2 and see how it goes. So an occlusive? not everyone takes well to occlusives (i‚Äôm talking aquaphor and vaseline etc), but a lot of moisturizers are occlusive to some degree, especially if they contain silicones or shea butter or mineral oil. it all depends on what works best for your skin :) I'll take a look around then. Thanks for the replies! ofc! AM:

- Cleanse with La Roche Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser. This has been my go-to cleanser for about three years now. I love that it‚Äôs super gentle on my sensitive skin, has niacinamide, and doesn‚Äôt leave my skin feeling tight after a wash, just soft and clean.

- Moisturize with Neutrogena Hydroboost. I basically just like the Hydroboost water gel for its hyaluronic acid. It doesn‚Äôt break me out and does it‚Äôs job of hydrating my skin really well without being too thick, which is key for my more oily forehead.

- Double moisturize with Kiehl‚Äôs Ultra Facial Cream. I have combo skin, so my foreheads a little oily and my cheeks are the Sahara desert. I go over the Hydroboost with the Kiehl‚Äôs on the high points of my cheeks, my nose, sides of my mouth, basically anywhere that tends to get dry just to really seal in the moisture and make sure my dry spots are reaaally taken care of, and it works great!

- Protect my skin from the sun‚Äôs rays with La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid. I love this sunscreen because it, very uniquely, doesn‚Äôt break me out or burn my skin. It feels very lightweight and even hydrating, I think it makes my skin feel even more soft. I put it on under my makeup and it doesn‚Äôt give me a white cast at all. I can‚Äôt seem to find another sunscreen that will do the same, so this is my holy grail!

PM:

- Take off my makeup with Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm. As I mentioned in the title, I used to have an extensive 10 step mostly Korean skincare routine and this product is the only one I‚Äôve actually liked and kept. It melts off my makeup instantly and leaves my skin feeling clean but not ‚Äúsqueaky‚Äù clean - I despise that tight, dry feeling after a wash.

- Cleanse again with the La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser. I find that if I try to be lazy and only wash with the cleansing balm I tend to break out, so I double cleanse.

- Use my Paula‚Äôs Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant. THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL. The crowning jewel of this entire skincare routine. It‚Äôs a more recent addition within the last month and it‚Äôs transformed my skin. I used to be okay with my skin, but this made me love it. I have had stubborn little forehead bumps for probably two years straight that never left no matter what I did. Even when my cheeks would be perfectly clear, my forehead/temples/hairline area would refuse. After using this exfoliant only once I realized the next morning that little pimples were fading, and after a few more uses they were completely gone. This is magic in a bottle!! I will probably repurchase this forever. If I use it daily it will make me a wee bit dry though, so I use it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with no issues.

- Moisturize with Neutrogena Hydroboost and Kiehl‚Äôs Ultra Facial Cream. I‚Äôm a huge believer that simpler is better for my skin! I think it allows the products and ingredients to actually do their job. 

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre finding success in your routine!!

edit: after reading some of the comments, I realized that I could have come across as insensitive. I didn‚Äôt mean to imply that if you use 20+ products in your skincare routine you are somehow doing something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or that you should simplify your routine. Not at all! Keeping things simple is just what has worked for my skin, but if your skin can handle you trying things out constantly and switching things up, more power to you. There is no right or wrong way to skincare! We have a similar routine and two products in common, the Hydro Boost and Paula's Choice. You probably know already, but there's a "gel cream" version of the Hydro Boost that is for dry skin. You might find it more moisturizing so you might not need two moisturizers. Just in case you wanted to go even simpler with your routine! LRP shaka fluid is my holy grail!! I think it's similar to this;-) I love that cleanser too! And the PC BHA. Our routines are pretty similar. Omg duuude the neutrogena hydro boost is amazing üò© the one for extra dry skin is actually lighter texture than I expected and it doesnt have fragrance either which is nice [deleted] That sunscreen breaks me out and it makes me so sad cuz I really like it So you‚Äôre saying that sunscreen is worth the finger I have to cut off to purchase? Honestly, same. 
The minute I cut down on using excessive products and opted for gentler ones, my skin started getting way better. 
Now all I use is a cleanser, toner and moisturiser. The simpler the better. I used to have so many toners, serums, moisturizers you call it and my skin looked like a mess.

Now my skincare only consists of cleansing balm, facial wash, sleeping mask, sunscreen and (occasionally) pimple-spot cream. My skin has never looked better than this. Is the Paula‚Äôs choice better than say, stridex pads? Interested in trying but I have a whole bunch of products with 2% SA already that didn‚Äôt do much for me. I've recently given up watching any type of influencers with their awesomely edited videos when it comes to skin care. I've switched to watching actual DOCTORS (i.e: dermatologists) instead. The videos are more drab and poorly done, but the INFORMATION is actually fucking legit. Why would I watched some 20-something girl with no science background tell me about her 10 step skin care routine?! 

To get to the point, the dermatologists that I've encountered have all said that you should use as few products as possible. Anything else is a capitlist scheme to get your money What else does the Paula‚Äôs choice exfoliant help with? I had to stop it because I‚Äôm using topical benzoyl peroxide but does anyone know if it helps with whiteheads and  inflammatory acne? Yes! Personally I just don't get those extreme 25 step routines and those shelfie pics with 30 different products. I bet half of it goes bad because you possibly can't use this much product at the same time! Simple is better! (also better for your bank account) The Paula‚Äôs choice 2% BHA liquid is heaven sent!!! This product has helped decrease my pore size and gives my skin a glow! La Roche Posay is amazing. I used it for years and noticed a difference in my skin. 

I now use Biotherm, which I think is the luxury version of it, and I like it too. The combo skin facial cleanser is amazing. I'm so annoyed, they dont have the LRP cleanser here in Germany. That face wash is the one step in my routine that hasn‚Äôt changed in years now. It‚Äôs so great. That sunscreen but the mineral one left a white cast on my skin for my face and sadly had to return it. I‚Äôve wanted a sunscreen that didn‚Äôt leave my skin oily and I haven‚Äôt found one yet. Any options? I have combination skin and acne prone skin. I‚Äôll definitely do a patch test with new products. I used to have bad acne but with bc and differin my skin got a lot better and clearer. Neutrogena water gel/ La Roche-Posey sunscreen twins!!! <3 love simple routines, good for you That nuetragena hydro boost is crazy good!! I use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser and it used to leave my skin super dry and flaky(i have oily skin) but once i got it the dryness was gone quickly its amazing! I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who double moisturizes! I looove the water gel formulas but they never *quite* get my dry spots hydrated enough. You‚Äôve also convinced me to try the Paula‚Äôs Choice exfoliant‚Äî thank you!! Paula‚Äôs choice bha is the mf TRUTH Could you tell me more about your skin type? I‚Äôm trying to figure out a skin care routine for my skin and there‚Äôs so many options, I am overwhelmed. Same! I had way better skin before I discovered skincare videos on YouTube. I used Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Cream w/ Retinol from ages 16 - 40. Always got compliments on my gorgeous skin. I am such a gullible person. I must be cursed or something, but the PC BHA does literally nothing for my skin A simpler routine with such no-nonsense, quality products. Now wonder it is working for you! Idk if I'm just late to the party, but I just saw that Walgreens started stocking LaRoche-Posay!! Um, are you me!!?!?! Lol. This is what I've been doing as well plus Vitamin A (tretinoin) and derivatives (retinol). It's really made a difference compared to throwing wayyyyy too many actives at once on my face - not that actives aren't great but one at a time seems to work much better for me. I use the Kiehl's facial cream as well and I love it! A little bit goes a long way, it will last forever! I use the same LaRoche-Posay sunscreen and love it. The tint will be too dark for my skin during fall/winter, but for now it has replaced my face makeup. Such a time-saving product! I‚Äôm trying to simplify my routine too! This looks great I'e also found that a reduced routine has really helped my skin. Now my routine is a morning splash of water, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Evening is a hydrating face wash, moisturizer (doubles as an eye cream), hydrocolloid bandages for problem spots, then top it off with Aquaphor as an occlusive to help seal in moisture. I find it more pleasant than sleeping with Vaseline all over my face. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Kiehls 

I use their facial fuel pretty regularly. Actually I need to go put some on now before I go outside. Thanks for reminding me! Simple routines have also been kinder to my skin. Love the clean balm! I was just wondering if I should buy La Roche Posay gentle cleanser or some other cleanser. Now I feel like I‚Äôm gonna buy this one. The LRP cleanser has been my go-to for over a year now, I love it and hope they never discontinue it.

I recently got a cute sample jar of the Clean It Zero and decided to take it with me on a trip, it worked beautifully as a first step for makeup removal. But after a couple of days of using it during the trip I noticed tiny whiteheads on my cheeks. I'm not sure if it's from the cleanser or the stress of travel but I'm hoping it was something else! We use 4/6 of the same products!! i have the same issue as you!! i might give that liquid exfoliant a try now~ Ahhh! My routine is identical except different brand for gel moisturizer and BHA! LRP CLEANSER AND SUNSCREEN FTW! You should consider getting the sensitive skin version of the hydro boost! It has no fragrance in it but the same ingredients :) I wish all these brands were cheaper where I'm from! I give my skin breaks, where my routine is very simple, no serums or treatments. For me it gives it a break and then when I get back to my routine they seem to work even better than before! This is similar to my routine and I've also seen a big improvement from all the lotions and potions I used to try! Another thing I keep on hand is LRP Cicaplast Baume B5. When I get breakouts that are very red or my eczema flares up on certain facial areas this really helps take down the redness and irritation for me! And most importantly doesn't cause further irritation. My s/o also uses it when under his beard gets red and itchy and it works great. Sometimes simple is definitely better. I also use to use all sorts of serums and essences and my face couldn't really take it, now I do the basic cleanse-tone-moisturize thing and my skin is as good as it's ever been. Is it bad that I just exfoliate and moisturise 2 times a day ? The Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream has saved my skin from looking dull and dry. It has become my holy grail. Simple is the way to go! Love it! I cannot believe I am seeing PC BHA on here!! I started using it in March and am obsessed. I use it every other day and alternate between spot applications on just my acne spots and sweeping my whole face with a cotton round. You only need like 3 drops! Love it KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid is my favorite This cleanser did nothing for me. Also smells like chlorine, really distracting while washing your face. The sunblock is everything. Highly recommend. I like waiting for sales at Ulta to get this sunblock. Nice! How do you like the Kiehls face cream? Me too...got essences, ampoules, serums...just for me to see better results just sticking to about 5 or 6 products I use interchangeably. Sometimes your skin is only meant to take a few products. I think Dr. Dray from YouTube would totally approve üëç I‚Äôve never heard of that cleansing balm before. Tell me more? Could you explain how you use these products? In what order, AM/PM, etc. I would truly appreciate it. What skin type do you have? Simple is best! Learned this the same way you did. My skin was fine before I started an extensive routine. I purchased all these products thinking that I‚Äôll need all of them. Applying several layers of different products increase the risk of breakouts so I‚Äôm trying to minimise my routine but since I have all these products I get tempted to try them every now and then ! Paulas choice really knows how to make exfoliants ! I use her bha body lotion on the face with no issues. Also its less drying than the liquid. where I live these products are like luxury really very expensive. so my skin is pretty much screwed, scars and dry flaky skin and break outs just really have made my life hell, gonna go to the doctor again. It's weird. I use moisturizer but my skin breakout when I don't use moisturizer My skin become extremely dry and red yet I still have breakouts. I mean I just can't deal with this crap. It's really depressing and sad. HELP! What are some of your criterias for switching to new skincare products / routines? I absolutely love the La-Roche Posay cleanser and Paula's Choice 2% BHA!! Is there a reason you use two moisturizers? 

\-Nia Oh, wow. I only have 3 steps (sometimes only two). I've gotten lazy as I've aged but my skin has also gotten better surprisingly. I do agree that simple is better. I love the Neutrogena water gel! Can‚Äôt believe how great it is for the price! And you get so much product. i don't get the hydro boost hype I used to have a routine with serums, heavy lotions, and night creams that gave me a plethora of blackheads. Now, I just do cleansing balm (also Clean-It Zero!), toner, essence, and moisturizer (with sunscreen during the day). My skin is doing MUCH better and I only get the occasional blackhead now. More complicated and expensive does not equal better!!! Is that Neutrogena worth the price? My skin isn't horrible but I have like dark circles and lines. This is literally all I need in skincare in this picture. Thank you for sharing. "simple routine" 6 products ;)
Laughs in caveman regimen and better skin than ever The Paula‚Äôs Choice BHA pretty much changed my life. It‚Äôs the best!!! Clean It Zero is honestly one of the best things I have ever bought! Literally just melts off makeup, even the toughest matte lipsticks. Love it so much! [deleted] I am also madly in love with Kiehl‚Äôs products ! I just recently started using the Paulas Choice BHA daily and after five days of usage my skin is in a pretty bad state.  It was odd, at around day 3 my skin was so nice and then day 5 i got a bunch of breakouts.  Think I overdid it so I will lay off it for a while and try alternating like you do! Anyone know if Paula‚Äôs choice would help with very stubborn chest acne? I have a few pimples that have been there forever and will not go away. If I decide to use it, I‚Äôll do a patch test so I don‚Äôt break out even more. [deleted] Had you tried the Ordinary salicylic acid before going for the Paula's Choice BHA/salicylic liquid? I've been seeing great results with the TO salicylic and, as far as I can tell, it's a lot less expensive. Smaller bottle but it's gel-like so you apply it directly from the dropper and don't lose any to a cotton pad, so it's hard to do a comparison on the basis of cost per volume. It never occurred to me to layer a more intense moisturizer on my dry spots over a lighter one all over!  Thank you!! Do you find the la roche pills up for you at all? I tried the previous version and the slightest touch on my face would make it start breaking up like crazy :( I think this is it chief. Sounds like everything I want. skin type ? Thank you for this! Your skin sounds a lot like mine‚Äîdry and sensitive but not without some blemish issues‚Äîand I‚Äôm going to borrow your routine. I already use the cleanser and moisturizer but I‚Äôve been looking for a product to clear up problem areas as well as a super hydrating cream for the dry spots. I‚Äôve tried soooo many various products over the years with either no results or only negative ones but La Roche Posay and Neutrogena Hydroboost have been perfect for me! Agree that‚Äôs implied is better‚Äîand it doesn‚Äôt have to cost a fortune! Ooh, we have a very similar routine. I was considering adding in PC Azelaic Acid for stubborn whiteheads, but maybe I'll take a closer look at the BHA. These products sound great! Thanks for the recommendations I have almost the exact same routine, except i use FAB cleanser and lotion, and a vitamin c in the morning. I found khiels made my skin angry. Ooh I want to try that Paula‚Äôs Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant. I have a nearly identical routine. Cleansing balm, gentle cleanser, SPF, Paula's Choice 2% BHA, Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream. I had been using the Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser (super gentle) but I might switch it up and try the La Roche Posay based on your recommendation! You just pushed me over the edge purchasing the Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream. So far so good. You get decent amount for the price (compared to more expensive brands) and my initial thoughts are that it moisturises very well and gives your skin that last layer of flare that makes it look healthy and warm.

A part from that I also use the Paulas Choice 2% Paulas Choice BHA, but the lotion instead of the liquid. Very talked about item in this sub and a stong contender as the first item to purchase to a skin routine.

Your La Roche Posay item looks interesting and I might try it out sometime. A very reasonably priced brand that really is providing great products. Is Paulas choice available in the Uk? And do you recommend the La Roche-Posey cleanser for oily skin? Xx Does the BHA bleech your pillowcase? Do u do all of this daily? Totally agree. I use about 6 products total and my skin looks and feels better than ever. I see some of these ‚Äúshelfies‚Äù with 50+ products and can‚Äôt imagine how confused my skin would be. Someone on Reddit posted here that she had lost her luggage with all her skincare items inside. She had just a few of the basics with her carry on which is what she had to use, and although she was devastated at first, she realized that her skin was completely fine after using the few products that she had. It was that post that made me reconsider how many lotions and cleansers I actually needed, and I think of it before I reach for another product. Especially because I think it's very tempting to buy 5 new products and use them all at once. Now you don't even know which one is helping or hurting! The trick is start simple then add products if you want to address some specific issue that isn't already being handled by your routine. So if you don‚Äôt have super dry skin but instead are more oily, just the aqua gel on its own should work right? I found out right after I had already bought the water gel, unfortunately! I‚Äôll definitely try it out once I‚Äôm done with the water gel I have now. Thank you! I use shaka fluid too, it‚Äôs great! Off-topic, but was wondering if you could help me. I love the products at DM. They seem good quality and great value for money. 
Have you happened to use any SebaMed product? I just started using the moisturizer but it seems to leave white patches behind.
Would you have any other Dm-stocked product recommendations?
Thanks! (26M here, still struggling to find my way around things) has the shaka been discontinued? OPs version is the only like one I see on their site now I use it and I get not so much of a white cast, but little white pilling. Switched to Biore essence and much better for my skin That sunscreen **burns** like crazy on me. :( Yea it has a lot of alcohol in it Amen! Influencers are paid to post so much of their content that it's hard to know what to trust from that perspective too. Not to mention the fact that I'm sure they're all getting treatments done at medspas and whatnot üôÑ It is a bha product, it has sal. acid in it so it helps with white heads, acne, texture, and getting rid of dry, dead skin cells that accumulate daily. Our skin naturally sheds so it breaks the glue that holds the cells together, so you can easily remove them. That being said...acne becomes less likely an issue and you will see smoother skin, BUT beware, some people are too sensitive, some can only handle a small percentage, less than 2 (2 or 3 is max over the counter). Some people can‚Äôt even handle it all. It all depends. If you want to try this product out, then do it once a day or like this person does, three times a week. If you are way too sensitive, stick to a soap-free cleanser, moisturizer to damp skin, and sunscreen. Use a wash cloth to not scrub, but to swipe your face so you don‚Äôt damage the lipid barrier. The wash cloth can pick up any sweat or dead skin skin cells that cause dermatitis or acne, some times cells are hardened and not even chemical exfoliation rids the sheets, it actually only dissolves the glue, you have to remove the sheets and that‚Äôs a different topic. But anyway...Also...the wash cloth will prevent fungal issues too, sometimes cleansers can‚Äôt pick up everything, especially if you have excess layers of the stratum corneum. So if you‚Äôre prone to redness and itchy skin, this may be helpful
To you. They do, Ive been using it for a year now. I like Sunprise Mild Airy finish, by etude. It's cheap, 100% mineral and doesn't leave a white cast. The con is that it has fragrance, but it never irritated my skin (and I have rosacea) Combo skin - mostly dry with an somewhat oily forehead. Kind of sensitive. My breakouts are mostly tiny bumps/whiteheads when you say one at a time do you mean cycling like month to month or day to day?

I use an acid serum and a retinol, currently retinol night one, acid night two, off night three, repeat. But I'm not sure if that's too  many actives in too short of a time frame. Have you tried it on damp skin? I didn't know to do  that at first and just thought it was a regular moisturizer. Putting it on slightly damp, freshly washed skin is a game changer! Its not really for dark circles. Its a moisturizer that's water based and blends well into the skin. It does not feel sticky and is light weight. A little bit goes a long way so I would say it's worth the price because it lasts long. I have to agree about Paula‚Äôs choice. I have combo skin a rosacea and her anti-redness bha is my holy grail. 
My routine is almost identical to op‚Äôs and the pc bah is my favorite part The 2% BHA didn‚Äôt make any big difference to my skin, am I supposed to use it with an AHA too? Also, what happens if I use too much or it‚Äôs too strong? How long does a bottle usually last you? Does anyone know where to buy Paula‚Äôs Choice in Canada?? Fully on board with Clean It Zero. Have tried other oil cleaners and always come back. It's a holy grail for me. What brand is the cleansing balm? I currently use Clinique and love it, wondering if there is a cheaper /equally effective alternative! Some  people can only use BHA max once a week, or it is crazy drying and irritating. I don‚Äôt know why PC suggests using it 2x a day! I‚Äôd cut it down.. and if it doesn‚Äôt work try something gentler I can only use it twice a week, but my husband uses it nightly (I‚Äôm super dry and he‚Äôs an oil field). Try using it every other day and go from there :) I had the same thing happen to me but then I read that this could be the skin purging. I cut back to using it once every other day and everything looks much better! It took about 2 weeks for the purging stage to complete but I'm glad I pushed through üôÇ The have a body BHA lotion! Yes, it‚Äôs definitely worth a try for that! I use it every day on my chest and it keeps my chest acne clear! I bought it for my face but my face doesn‚Äôt tolerate it all that well but my chest has no issues with me slathering it on every night before bed. It‚Äôs been the only thing that‚Äôs cleared my chest breakouts and I‚Äôve tried a lot! :) I have chest issues too. I use Amlactin lotion than once it dries I use Sephoras jojoba oil or Aquaphor on top. If using the Aquaphor do it at night cause it‚Äôs sticky. In a few days my chest cleared and is nice and smooth. If I stop that routine it comes right back. I also have rosacea on my chest so this is gentle enough to treat everything. I started with once a week to patch test and now I do it daily or every other day. It‚Äôs really nice after a shower. Good lucküå∫ I use Clean It Zero to remove all eye and face makeup. No additional eye makeup remover. It's gentle and no scrubbing required. Rinses off no problem. Not pictured is an Aven√© eye makeup remover I use to take off my mascara, so my Clean It Zero doesn‚Äôt really get all into my eye area, therefore I‚Äôm not sure :( When rinsing it really doesn‚Äôt leave any kind of film though. I was using the Ordinary before I switched to PC... I figured there would be no difference since they‚Äôre both 2%. The PC one is way more effective for my skin though, NO idea why! You can use the PC 2% BHA with hands too, you don‚Äôt need the cotton pad. I just drip a little into my palm and then rub my hands together and rub it in. Usually that is from mixing product bases. Like trying to put a water or oil based product on top of silicone, or vice versa. It‚Äôs less about LRP and more about the interaction between it and the product underneath! Seems like Dimethicone is pretty high on the ingredients list for the Anthelios. If you let your moisturizer absorb for just a bit longer you may see better results. Not the OP, but I use both the Neutrogena hydroboost and the La Roche sunscreen and don't experience any pilling. I actually find that the hydroboost dries a little tacky on my skin, and the La Roche has a nice matte finish that makes it easier to put makeup on top of. update: /u/islaicaria i just purchased the sunscreen, cleanser, and hydrating boost moisturizer. 

will return after a month to see how it worked out.

edit: how do you use your BHA liquid exfoliant? like a cleanser? put on+ wash off? Benzoyl peroxide is the active that will bleach things, just so you know what to look for in the ingredients list. The PC is salicylic acid [deleted] I skimmed through the first sentence and literally thought that this woman had a completely separate luggage for her skincare and I screamed Also, if you at all care about fragrance, the dry skin version has none while the normal version does. Only pointing this out because I had slight irritation to the normal version (eyes would water after I put it on) and when I use the dry gel cream, I have no issues!  It's a good idea to top hylaronic acid with a moisturizer to seal it in I have oily skin and the aqua gel works well for me! It sinks right in without any heavy feeling and leaves me moisturized. I hope it works for you! I recently switched to it from the water gel version and I do find it more moisturising - I sometimes had to apply the water gel twice to feel properly hydrated. I'm in Europe so it might be different. We don't have the one OP posted! The shaka is the EUR version. We don't have shaka in the US unless we buy it from Europe. The ultra light fluid that OP posted is the closest you can buy easily in the US. That‚Äôs very helpful, ty! :) Where did you find it? My local pharmacy doesnt have it and said LRP doesnt have it on they european market I agree, I‚Äôm oily with rosacea and use this. It‚Äôs a great sunscreen Thanks! I think I might have rosacea but I‚Äôm not 100 percent sure. I was thinking about trying the la roche posay non mineral one because maybe it‚Äôs the mineral aspect that leaves a white cast. I‚Äôll check out the sunprise mild airy finish one too. More day to day but it depends on the person and active I'd say. I think it's most helpful to experiment with different things and see how your skin does, while also keeping in mind that it can take at least a few weeks to see how things are going.

Your routine sounds fine to me if your skin is doing ok - I also would assume that your skin is experienced with and comfortable with acids and retinol. I do this exact thing with the gel cream version and it's made an enormous difference. Yeah i got a small bottle recently and probably won‚Äôt buy it again. I haven‚Äôt noticed any change at all, good or bad I rotate with her aha gel and the liquid bha and it's the bomb I‚Äôve only ever bought the travel size because I usually have no money and it lasts me like 1.5~2 months I asked this q in this sub previously because I heart her Salicylic Acid but couldn't stomach the shipping and customs fees and people suggested trying The Ordinary brand instead. Hoser‚Äôs Choice 

Seriously though, if their website doesn‚Äôt ship to Canada you can buy it on Amazon. From their website. Shipping is free if you spend $50. I buy this exfoliant and a vitamin C serum so easily go over $50. If you buy just the exfoliant you could buy two at a time? I buy from their website and they ship to manitoba canada with no import duties I like the Farmacy Green Clean formula a tiny bit better, but Clean it Zero definitely has the better price point. I just wish I had more things to get from SoKo to justify  repurchasing it instead of the Farmacy. So totally agree. I've found nothing that can get makeup off quite like it. It's amazing! It‚Äôs the BanilaCo Clean it Zero. I use this as well and it‚Äôs amazing! Melts everything off and leaves skin feeling clean and hydrated I like Albolene. It‚Äôs fragrance-free and contains a minimal ingredients list with nothing irritating in it. It‚Äôs cheap and widely available at the drugstore. Best oil cleanser I‚Äôve ever tried! Liquify in hands; apply to dry face and massage; remove residue with hot wrung-our wash cloth or tissue; cleanse skin after with La Roche Posay Toleraine gentle hydrating cleanser! And a bha body spray Oh wow that sounds great! Which product are you referring to? Thanks everyone! I'll try it out and hopefully I get good results. Interesting! Now I'm intrigued. Damn, no kidding! I waited a solid 30 minutes after my morning routine before putting it on and no pilling whatsoever. Thanks so much! I put the exfoliant on at night after the cleanser and before the moisturizer. I leave it on overnight and then wash it off in the morning. I don‚Äôt use it in the day because when you have it on it can make you more sensitive to the sun. I hope it works for you too!! I'm one of those people with professional equipment and the entirety of Dermstore & Sephora on towers in my bathroom. Skincare is what I like to put my spending money towards since I don't go on outings, drink or have any other hobbies. I work so much that I don't have time for anything, so my skincare hobby developed out of that. It's what I do for my mental health, and it makes me happy.

I personally don't ever want to make a person feel bad about something they might value more than I do. Some people have salon racks in their home for nail polish because it's their hobby, some people have craft rooms, baking supplies and kitchen gadets, spend money and time creating cosplay outfits.. all things that sound so fun to me and I wish I had the time for.

I was kinda shamed by a few for posting a Shelfie once and it definitely took a dig at me because I was really proud of it, I worked so hard on it and for it... and in my mind, posting a photo here would be similar to when people put all kinds of work into cars and bring them to car shows for others to see what they created. Sharing something you're proud of that makes you happy with others. Instead, people were upset and just threw all of their opinions at me. I deleted it because the negative comments were too much for me to handle, and it turned something that made me genuinely happy into something I felt ashamed for having even though I worked incredibly hard for it. I know I shouldn't let words from a stranger on the internet get to me.. but it did. I'm just sharing this to kindly share a perspective on how words to a stranger can impact them. Where it's just a comment you write in passing then forget about... it can fuel someone's anxious thoughts and make them feel pretty terrible for a while. Not saying that anyone here did that, at all! I just felt like it fit the conversation. I second this post. It really depends on what your problems are and different ingredients can tackle different issues. I wish I had a simple routine but in reality I have 10-15 products. I don't use all the products simultaneously, it depends on what's wrong with my skin at a given moment, what it needs to get better, and then when that issue is resolved I jump back to another set of product that target another issue. Through trial and error, I have identified which products and ingredients work great for a certain set of issues.

There's been a lot of posts here about "how everything became even better once I started using only 2-4 stuff" and it makes people feel self-conscious. It's like a hivemind or something. If someone does it, I gotta do it too. And that is not helpful to people that have real issues and are looking for the best (affordable) combination of products to make it better. The only problem with this^ for oily skin is that you wake up feeling absolutely gross. Not so much hydrated but like you're swimming in oil. Because it's for dryer skin. I bought this version in Poland, so it is in the European market. I got mine at Rossman if you are at all close to one There is, just in different name. Try to search for LRP caring wash PMd :) I buy mine on mercari, I got a full size bottle with free shipping for 18 bucks. The only thing is that sometimes there's nobody selling any but I just keep it in my saved searches and when I start running low I start checking until I find one with good price, which has taken, at most 3 days. \+1 for the Canadian hoser humour üá®üá¶ Looking to buy now while they have free shipping - indeed shipping is free at checkout, there are taxes and a $5 USD brokerage fee added. I think that's what I was thinking of for duties. Thank you :) Sorry I was trying to respond to a question you or someone was asking about if the Paula‚Äôs Choice 2% BHA liquid would be good for chest acne. And yes it‚Äôs been great for mine! :) I just pour it in my hands and rub my hands together and rub it on my chest every night before bed and it causes 0 issues, only a clearer chest. It makes my face a little tight and dehydrated but doesn‚Äôt do that whatsoever to my chest even though the skin on my chest is sensitive. Yeah! I‚Äôm glad I let my curiosity get the best of me and ordered a little travel size of it to try it. [deleted] I am so sorry that people are such A'holes. I notice a lot of shady comments especially on here. Women are constantly blaming men for treating us like crap and holding us down, but I see just as many women, if not more tearing each other down. We should be lifting each other up. I shared a traumatic story from my childhood on lets not meet and the negative comments people left really affected me because I was already feeling vulnerable. Because of the comments I ended up editing my story to justify certain parts so people would understand. Because I did that I had someone comment on how annoying it was that I added too many tid bits to it. I shouldn't have let the comments bother me, but I am human and unfortunately care what others think. 

I would have loved to see your shelfie, because I too love skincare and I love trying new things and I have ended up with a good collection. It makes me happy, I do not go out or drink, I only wear skechers tennis shoes, I don't like clothes shopping, I don't get my nails done, I don't buy jewelry, I buy skincare products! 

I became disabled 4 yrs ago exactly. My condition makes it really hard to be active or visit with friends. I have to have a fan blowing on me continuously because I have a severe form of Erythromelalgia aka burning man syndrome, along with small fiber neuropathy and fibromyalgia. Before I became disabled I hadn't worn makeup and even though I had acne I would only wash my face in the shower and use wipes on my face before bed.
I have become a little ocd since I have been disabled because I have no control over my pain.

I have always loved makeup and skincare but wouldn't use it even though I loked having it. I started the ipsy subscription and I have become a SkincareAddict and love my skincare routine and love wearing makeup a few times a week.

I truly appreciate anyone's shelfie no matter how big or small, and it doesn't matter if it's drug store brands or expensive brands. I appreciate that they are taking the time to share. I really hope that you share your shelfie again at some point.

My new hobby is making my own cosmetic skincare formulas, and I absolutely love it! Thanks for sharing your experience! I‚Äôm sorry people were rude to you. For me, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs necessarily anything to inherently judge about a long routine or using a ton of diff products. I think what‚Äôs annoying to me is when people just buy a ton of expensive products without understanding their skin, thinking those expensive, trendy lotions and potions will magically fix their problems by just piling them on. And then when they have develop problems, they want recs for even more fancy lotions and potions. Or people who have naturally good skin and have a line of expensive products they attribute to that when it‚Äôs really just genetics (ie lots of influencers). 

I‚Äôve seen some of your posts and you seem like you really understand your skin and what your products do for you. That‚Äôs awesome, and more power to you regardless of how many products you use! People absolutely have different skin goals... mine is to narrow down on the same products I can use every day because my skin likes routine and consistency. And I will say that most people with skin issues (though of course not all) can benefit from that rather than jumping around a lot. But I can def see some folks might have skin that responds best to different things depending on the day. Oh, no! I‚Äôm sorry you were shamed for that! I didn‚Äôt mean for my comment to come off as judge-y in any way, but I can see now how it could be taken that way. It was just an agreement that fewer products work better for me personally, not that others shouldn‚Äôt enjoy as many serums and potions as their heart desires! 

I had terrible acne as a teen, took Acutane for it (this was in the 90‚Äôs so I‚Äôm not even sure this is used/safe anymore??) and then had zero breakouts for years. All of a sudden, I start breaking out a again a few years ago when I hit my 30‚Äôs (thanks PCOS!) and I tried so many products which only made it worse. I ended up paring down to just a few products from The Ordinary and my skin cleared up! I honestly wish I could experiment more, but I kind of have a fear of messing up a good thing. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs a little backstory on why I personally had better luck with fewer products. If you‚Äôve found what works for you, keep on doing it! And sorry again if I sounded like a jerk; was totally not my intention! :) can you PM me your shelfies? I would love to see!!! I feel this. It's becoming more of a joyful mental health hobby. I still have no idea what I'm doing, but I feel like I'm loving myself so it's alright üíå Tbh, I have pretty oily skin and this doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. Most of it soaks in and leaves a film on my skin but I use Thayer‚Äôs Witch Hazel in the AM to wipe it off and then go on with my morning routine. But of course this is different for everyone, but just wanted to put the info out there! I havent found anything that contains the same ingredient. Would you mind sending me a photo of your bottle? Thanks for the tip! I was not charged customs Conversely I've tried the BanilaCo before and felt it left a film behind on my skin that was hard to get rid of, I much prefer the Clinique balm - but YMMV! There's different kinds too. What OP posted was the default, but there's also sensitive, acne prone,  etc Oh, it‚Äôs ok! Thank you! I really appreciate it. :D Thanks :) Same, all the care keeps my skin clear and in a place that I am happy with.. I haven't worn makeup in years because I'm so proud of my skin. Aside from BioDerma and different AM and PM cleansers, my routine is different all 7 days of the week down the the moisturizer. I pick a group of products after looking at my skin in the mirror and seeing what I feel it needs. Certain moisturizers don't work with my serums or scripts/treatments, or maybe I don't need something as heavy as the night before due to something else I used.. etc etc. Sure it's totally unnecessary, but it helped me overcome dreadfully severe skin picking started at years old. Young me would never believe that 29 year old me wears no makeup without a trace of the issue. I basically exploit my desire to maintain anything that cost me a decent amount of time or money! Haha.

If you don't mind me asking, what's the most impactful active you've ever used and top 5 favorite products of all time? Same. I used the water gel and loved it but my local cvs ran out so I decided to try the one for dry skin even tho I'm super oily. And it works! My skin feels refreshed and soft all day. It's one of my HG products now. It's so wonderful. This is my experience as well. I actually started using the dry skin version exclusively! I don‚Äôt apply a moisturizer in the AM (I‚Äôm a total greaseball by 10am if I do) and using the dry skin formula allows me to splash my face with water in the AM followed by my SPF and not feel dry at all. I'm oily and I find the gel cream to be perfect. It's not too occlusive and it sinks in well. It's my HG right now. I honestly don't even know when to use my toner after using my serums and essence so that's interesting. I'll give it a try next refill:) I live in Turkey and pretty much everything here comes from France. I thought Germany would have that but ill send it. Would you prefer a cleansing balm over a micellar water for getting rid of makeup? Does it clean better? I've never tried a balm and Im now wondering if I should. Yep! and to be clear, I don't use it right after. But in the AM, I'm honestly too lazy to do my CeraVe face wash with water and all that, but I just use a toner to cleanse last night's products off, and then apply my AM routine. **definitely** cleansing balm over micellar water. Micellar water has its uses and I admit to using it when I'm too lazy to actually cleanse but want to generally take my makeup off, but an oil cleanser will do a much better job.

You don't necessarily need a balm type though, there are plenty of liquid oil cleansers that you can find for cheaper. I really like the Clinique balm but honestly recently I've been saving that for travel and at home I've been using the Simple Cleansing Oil which is like $10 and is lasting forever because you only use like a teaspoon each time. I would say I like it equally to the Clinique balm - it gets all my makeup off, emulsifies and rinses off really well, and has good slip so that I can also take the opportunity to give myself a nice face massage when I use it üòÅ Thanks!! I think I‚Äôll give it a go. I previously had cystic acne so once I found something that cleared it I‚Äôve been sooo scared to change even one thing. But I think I‚Äôll give it a shot! TIL I have very, *very* similar taste in skincare products to a 16 year-old guy.

Seriously, though, I have ~90% of those products. I hope they work well for you! Hyloronic acid is best used before any moisturizer and when skin is wet. Also be kind to your skin that's a lot of products and more products doesn't equal better skin. Hi, everyone. Sorry for the bad quality and not editing this picture, but I thought why not share my Shelfie for the first time.

I know why not in my bathroom? Well, I'm a student, so typically I rush and the bathroom would be a huge problem area for my essentials to be in.

I'm aware that some of the products such as the Vit C may oxidize if not refrigerated, but my room is cold more often then not, so I keep them there for now.


Here are the products I use.
My skin is **Dry, Acne-Prone, Combination with oils in my T-Zone**



Toners: 

**HADA Labo Gokuyjun Premium** - Holy grail, I use this on days when I feel like my skin is ultra dry, I don't want to waste this product, so I use it sparingly, no layering

**Son & Park BEAUTY Water** - Definitely refreshing, may look to replace, but it is incredible, just for the 22 dollars I don't think it's all that worth it, I'll have to keep using it and update you all later.

Toners **NOT IN THE PICTURE** -

**Kikumasamune Sake Skin Lotion High Moisture - 500ml** - I heard this was a holy grail for many many people, so I decided to purchase, I'm waiting for it to arrive in the mail.

Moisturizers:

**First Aid Beauty Repair Cream** - this product I've heard mixed reviews on, apparently some people breakout, BUT, this product has been treating my skin incredibly. I've just now tried it with rosehip oil and it seems a little thick when mixed but not bad as it absorbs after a few minutes, this is my PM moisturizer.

**Vanicream Lite Cream** (you can't see it but it's behind the hada labo) - this mixed with hyaluronic acid leaves the skin incredible, it's nothing special in terms of ingredients but does the job even on these winter days.

**cleansers and scrubs**

**cerave hydrating cleanser** - HOLY GRAIL this product isn't exactly my OH MY Gosh product but it literally takes my pimples and gives them that "white head" and in a few days the puss seems to just come out, it's very hydrating and soothing.

**Banila Co Clean It Zero Balm** - THIS CAME IN THE MAIL Today so haven't tried it but I heard it's incredible for some people.

**Softymo Speedy OIL cleanser** - leaves nothing greasy behind, eliminates any residue or spf that's on my skin

**Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash** - PROBABLY THE ONLY GOOD product in the entire line for people with dry skin, that said, I'm using it sparingly, when I'm not using BHA or AHA.

**Serums / Essences** :

**Cosrx 96 Snail Mucin** - HOLY GRAIL reduces Redness, leaves my skin looking shiny and luxurious, good product, definitely a repurchase.

**Klairs Vit C** - HOLY GRAILfor now anyways, I'm gonna try Vit C with more strength, but this Vit C is a little heavy when on my skin when first applied, but absorbs fairly quickly. May repurchase

**Snail Bee High Content Essence ** - HOLY GRAIL I use this for my PM routine and it's essential for reducing Redness and I've seen major improvement. 

**MIZON hyaluronic acid** - this I use in my AM routine, I put a few drops on my face, then mix some in my moisturizer and it feels amazing. 


**OILS, BHA, AHA**

**Cosrx BHA Power Liquid** - notice some improvement, but nothing too significant to warrant a repurchase. 

**Paula's Choice BHA** - Haven't tested, but it was highly recommended. 

**The Ordinary Rosehip Oil* - feels a little heavy mixed with moisturizer, but it's hydrating. 

**The ordinary AHA 10 BHA 2 peel** - came highly recommended, but haven't tried yet, will update later. 

**Cosrx AHA 7** - Saw visible improvement, very good, may repurchase if nothing else comes out. 

**SPF**

- **biore uv aqua rich essence (2017)** - what's all the complaining about? It's good, it goes on the skin fine, and doesn't irritate.

- **Elta MD UV Clear broad spectrum spf 46** haven't tried this yet but came highly recommended and designed for acne prone skin.

WOAH THAT WAS A LOT. THANKS EVERYONE.  If you're still getting acne using this routine you might be over doing it. If it works for you that's great. Good on you. So many teenagers are clueless about skincare and they desperately want (and *need*) to know more. You're a rich 16 year old lol.

Both your sunscreens are the only ones my face likes.

The elta makes my face shiny but I feel like it protects better and is healthier. The only thing that helped me as a teenager were prescription acne products. Might be something worth looking into. I wish my mother took me to a dermatologist a lot earlier than she did.  Sometimes less is more Lot of products! On a random note, I love that mirror/ dresser. [deleted] This has to be more expensive than a dermatologist appointment and some good sunscreen and the dermatologist is probably going to get better results. Do u really need that many products, or even use that many on a regular basis? 

Not even Korean models use more than like, 11 products in a day. Dude, that‚Äôs ambitious and it‚Äôs never too early - but if you are 16...your beard is still forming.

Go easy on yourself, and make sure you stay active and try to maintain a good, cleanish diet.

And stay away from drugs and alcohol, and do your homework. This is far, far, far too much. Acne-prone skin is usually on the sensitive side and using this many items is going to stress it out more. Go to a dermatologist and get a gentle cleanser, moisturizer with sunscreen, and a treatment for acne. That‚Äôs all you need.  This is just taking it too far bruh I absolutely love the Elta MD sunscreen! It‚Äôs probably the best one I‚Äôve used so far.  Don't stress too much about your skin or acne at 16! Do the best you can, but understand this will be part of your journey at this moment and it's ok  Hi, another male who knows too much about skincare for his own good here.

I think you're making this too complicated...imo. My best skin came from the most simple of routines.

Gentle cleanser, 2.5% BP, Moisturizer (or just jojoba oil at night).

Also, nobody ever talks about this here but I had a treatment called Levulan that changed my whole damn life. Completely got rid of ALL my acne. Expensive, turns you into a red faced freak for a month but my acne went down by 95%. Zero regrets. Hey if you are acne prone, I wouldn't use the Banila Clean it zero,  the old formulation was highly spoken of, but apparently the new formulation is comedogenic,  I read on Asian beauty reddit! :) Can we talk about how bitchin that drawer hardware is [deleted] As someone who had acne for like 13 years, I think I should add that most of the times acne is caused by something going wrong internally. In my case, it was a hormonal imbalance that leads to a combination of inflammation and too much sebum.

I recommend a trip to the endocrinologist, it may help more. 

Good luck! super cute how you've lined the products up next to their empty boxes to make it look even more excessive  [deleted] take your upvotes and go my friend, you're avoiding legitimate questions/comments about your post You really stocked up on that Cerave huh First of all that counter/drawer is insane You might wanna try vanicream. For me all cleansers broke me out... using just water helped a lot. Then I realized it was the moisturizers breaking me out... I‚Äôve tried EVERYTHING. Vanicream lite is the first one in years that has not broken me out. Then Mandelic acid / tactuo has helped with closed comedones (exfoliation). Haven‚Äôt been this clear since I got acne for the first time. That is a lot..... Goodness! I'm 43 and don't so all that lol though at 13 I would have given anything to clear my skin up. No Reddit 30 yrs ago though.  Hey mate, 27 year old male here. How are those products going for you? I had terrible Acne growing up, and those things did absolutely nothing but burn a hole in my pocket.  


From experience I'd say to stop wasting your money on that stuff, but I guess if it's working for you then good on ya! My skin cleared up once my diet changed. I invested thousands and thousands of dollars from age 15 to 32. Wish that I had known it had to do with food I was eating! Good luck! Where did you get that gigantic tub of FAB repair cream? How much was it? Where did you get that massive bottle of Biore UV? Wow. You are really stocking upon those cerave products lol. How's your skin doing?  Fuck  [deleted] Woah! Weird seeing you have the same dresser that my grandpa passed to my brother, it‚Äôs so unique!  [deleted] That first aid beauty moisturizer has been a holy grail for me. Cerave broke me out and it was a miracle when not only did this not break me out but I saw a pretty quick improvement in my skin  looks nice i‚Äôm a 15M been interested in both the elta and biore sunscreens which do you like the most? Whoa totally different clean it zero packaging! Do I spy Baymax?  Yee boi, get that clear skin! I've tried almost all of your products, except for the Hada Labo premium, Neutrogena grapefruit face wash, Klairs serum and the CosRX bha/aha liquids.

What's the one product that makes the biggest difference to your skin? Personally I'm a big fan of the PC 10% AHA liquid - nothing kills pimples like it does, srsly. I wish I knew about skincare when I was 16 :) See how your acne reacts to the BHA when you‚Äôre ready to incorporate it. I‚Äôd also look into an OTC retinol treatment and niaminacide to help with pores. Avene Triacneal or Paula‚Äôs Choice retinol and niaminacide drops are a good place to start. At your age, some of the acne is probably hormonal so you might find that it doesn‚Äôt completely go away for a while, but actives will keep it at a minimum and reduce the risk of scarring. Keep us updated! x Hi, maybe you should try to change something in your diet. In my case skin problems was caused by dairy, sugar and gluten. After I quit them, my skin is in much much better condition:)  Ever heard of isotretinoin? How did you get such a big tub of the first aid beauty cream? I really want to give a big tub to my mom but I can‚Äôt find them anywhere! I wish I got into skincare when I was 16! Sounds like you're doing everything right, but don't get discouraged if your acne doesn't clear up for a while even with your routine. Puberty really does wreck your skin, but you're setting up some really great habits and starting the trial-and-error game to see what your skin likes early on, and that's important. I wash my face with water sometimes. Clear skin from 14 to 35 years old. I feel really stupidly lucky when I read posts like this. Find a facialist who specializes in extractions and acne and start seeing them. That was the one thing that finally cured me of acne after years and years of trying different products. They may even be able to turn you on to certain products/moisturizers. Mine makes her own products with all natural ingredients which I also think contributes to your skin health. Over the counter products are slightly designed to keep you getting acne so you keep buying their products.  i had acne for almost 15 yrs... literally tried EVERYTHING apart from a face transplant. finally my dermatologist prescribed me Spirinolactone (aka Aldactone) and it cleared right up, along with a typical cream (Epiduo forte). the creams Not cheap but totally worth it! Aldactone is only about $17 a month. That biore uv is the best üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå Yo if you have acne problems then you should seriously consider a drug called Accutane. I had terrible, terrible acne for years that responded to no treatment until Accutane. There are a lot of myths and horror stories about the drug online but don‚Äôt let that scare you, it truly will change your life for the better. I haven‚Äôt had acne in over a year now and I am so happy I did it :) I wish I could've figured out how to take care of my skin when I was that age! From a 25 yo male, good for you man great job on the products and good luck on your journey!!  The fact that I can name every single product means I have gone way too far down the skincare hole lol. Love your collection, it looks quite a bit like mine. I have been obsessed with skincare this past year, but after years of trying things the only thing that cleared my skin was tretinoin. But I'm still in love with skincare and working to get rid of my scars. Good luck and keep up the good fight. Starts internally.  Eat right.   Where did you get your Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence? They don‚Äôt have it on amazon right now.  I'm sure clear skin is in your future!  [deleted] But why so many of each product?  I do the exact same thing sooo many products üòÇ Please, tell me that vanity is antique. 

It‚Äôs BEAUTIFUL and I want to know what all the drawers (?) say. this looks like my girlfriend's vanity be still my cosrx heart  Wondering, have you been to an aesthetician?  This year I will definitely get a snail mucin going on  LOVE the Paula‚Äôs choice BHA (I‚Äôm oily though), I just started the COSRX aha and I think I like it so far.

I am digging the apothecary drawers. The ordinary niacinimide and azelaic acid cleared up all my acne. Highly recommend trying those two!  seem like you are a reader from simpleskincarescience We are the same age, and have similar taste in skincare. I own and have tried most of your products and have similar issues with acne and dry combination skin.  So this is weird but I have the matching piece to that vanity of yours! I didn‚Äôt know any other pieces existed! Mine is just a chest without the mirror, do you know the history of it? I bought mine secondhand and can‚Äôt find any information about it anywhere!  what's up br√∂der, I'm also a 16 y/o dude. ty for the post :)  Out of curiosity why do you keep the packaging?
Also lol at the people in the comments losing it over your age and chiming in with their two cents about your age üôÑ... good for you and your gorgeous skin routine!! Yesssss you have the snail mucin!! Damn I wish I had been this knowledgeable about skincare when I was 16, instead of scrubbing the life of it for years. Good luck on your skin journey! Accutane asap if I was u. Regret not doing it earlier. Within a couple weeks I was clear  Diet

Edit: and never cheat. It‚Äôs what kills most efforts to eat right. One slip up and you feel as though it‚Äôs not working.  I want to apologize to everyone if I seemed overly condescending, I just don't like it when someone tries too hard to push their ideas on me. I just want to try a few products and see what works on my skin.


As for the dermatologist, I'm scheduled to go back in a few weeks, so looking forward to it. Usually my consultations with my derm are very awkward, I try and tell her that some Sunscreens are greasy, and she says "no greasy, no greasy, protection, not greasy". 

Which kind of makes me lose hope but I'll try again. I'm not taking too much time into this whole skincare thing I'm more focused on my grades and enjoying my teenage years while they last. 

I may seem a little uninformed, but I would never blindly go in without doing a little research first! Hope you can all understand! For the people cheering me on, I hope you have longevity with everything you do! 

Thank you! Much love and happy new year üíï!  Everyone is hating on you for having lots of products in your routine but sometimes you have to experiment to find what works. I definitely tried most of these items to find a routine that worked for my skin. Also, this sub seems to dislike the asian skincare strategy in general, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it. I also love asian skin routines. 

That being said, if you're concerned about acne, topicals are only really going to address symptoms, not the underlying biological cause of the acne, whether its a hormonal imbalance, an intolerance to dairy, or over production of bacteria on the skin. Something internal is causing that problem and it can help to address that as well, otherwise you will always be stuck with these long routines. Omg I am so jealous!  Ey im sixteen too, really hard to find anyone else whose into skincare at this age [deleted] Relatable üòÇüòÇ Impressive collection! ;) good luck! [deleted] What a pimp ass bureau Hello, I was just wondering if you are in the United States and if you have tried curology? I had a terrible outbreak, after 20 years of Perfect Skin, when I turned 36.. and it was TERRIBLE HORMONAL ACNE on my JAW and CHINLINE that I spent tons of money at Sephora trying to fix with different expensive products, and doing face peels to try to clear it up. 

Curology cleared me up within 2 weeks. Your first bottle is free ( only $5 shipping), when you sign up and fill out a survey about your skin care concerns and upload pictures of your bare face. So you only pay $5 shipping for your first month's bottle, & after that bottles are 25 a month total- but they give you much more than you actually need to use in a month, so I always went online to their website and scheduled my next bottle to be pushed out aways so I wasn't throwing product away. 

You get to talk to your provider through messaging and can send a message anytime and get a reply usually within 48 hours, and I learned a lot from all of the information in our conversations, and they can also call in prescriptions to your Pharmacy.

 all for that$25 monthly price. It worked very well for me (except that either retinol itself -which I think is the problem, or the base they used in their cream made my skin very oily and it was Oily to begin with.. so I quit.

 I did find a product that I am not affiliated to.. but I do Rave about it because it is expensive and has cleared up my acne all by itself, & is over the counter, and all it is is an apple cider vinegar mix toner that you can make at home.. or you can buy my exact mix on the Etsy website- from a shop called "terracottapaste". 

The product is called "ACV toner", and I get the extreme version, (so cannot vouch for the weaker versions). It has tea tree oil and lavender oil, which both are antibacterial.. so they killed the P acne germ and the apple cider vinegar is at a low PH so it helps to exfoliate your skin with every use and apple cider vinegar is kind of like a cross between salicylic acid and an aha.. and it definitely exfoliates, clears up acne by killing the P acne bacteria, and tea tree oil will help fungal acne too because TTO is antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antifungal ..so it has many uses, and it along with lavender oil both in this product, lavender oil and tea tree oil after 2 months of using this product, reduced my sebum production by a large amount, so that my skin is clear and normal now. 

It took two weeks to clear all the terrible acne and two full months to see the benefits of the reduced sebum. I never get zits anymore and if I ever do they are tiny and go away very quickly . It's great because it keeps my skin at a good pH and exfoliates daily to keep any buildup from blocking pores. They also use palm oil and their witch-hazel is alcohol-free witch-hazel. It's an 8 oz glass amber bottle.. and you can make it at home- or I believe on Etsy it is about $10 with $8 shipping, but it lasts for a VERY LONG TIME. 

Just a suggestion because I've never had any 1 product do that for me (except the prescription from curology)- and especially nothing inexpensive!!

Curology is an awesome way to go to go. I wish I had not had a reaction to the tretinoin in my prescription cream.. or else I would have kept using it. According to the provider I had she said it will make 10% of the population more oily whereas it normally dries out the rest of the population.

Hope that helps! (I'm trying to get my name changed on here, and if they will not do it I will have to close my account and start a new to protect my privacy, so I'm just giving you all I can going off what I know before I may need to close this account.)

Have a good one! I'm so jealous üò≠üò≠üò≠ but I wish you all the best üôè Good job bro, I didn't take skincare serious until I was 18. The earlier the better bro and since you have acne you should look into medical procedure such as accutante, but most importantly speak to a dermatologist because I am not very education on this since I personally have never had acne, I am just saying what I heard worked for friends and people that I follow. [removed] [deleted] Damn. Ewe a lukie bish.

Good luck Can't imagine the look on your gfs face LMAO Sorry for not responding earlier, I was writing, a long, Long, review paragraph... But thanks!  Omg, came here to write this. What are the odds? :) Happy New year to everyone here. I‚Äôm glad this is the most upvoted thing and not the ‚Äòdiet, hydrate, exercise‚Äô mess going on below.  Came here to say exactly the same thing!  lol I had the same thought! What is your favourite between the  **Cosrx 96 Snail Mucin** and the Benton  Snail Bee High Content Essence? Never had Acne so I can't fully appreciate the seriousness of the situation, I was blessed with clear skin, **but**, genuinely asking here, is this not too much to put on your skin every day?

Again I don't know your situation or how severe it is so can't judge, but I can't imagine all of this is needed to rid Acne?

Wishing you a great 2019 with clear healthy skin! Nice! Have u tried squalane oil? It's rly lightweight but ultra hydrating so it's great to mix with moisturizers. It's even great on its own!

Here's to better skin health in 2019!!!! I‚Äôve been using Elta MD (both AM and PM versions) for 4 years and my skin loves it.  they‚Äôre more moristurizing than the Biore essence, which i also really like.  I use both the Elta for a main moisturiser then the Biore in areas that need extra moisture, in the morning.  If you want less acne, you have to use fewer products. Every product is another potential source of irritation. This is ridiculous. Skin is different for everyone, but I can't imagine putting all that on your skin is going to be remotely as helpful for resolving your acne issues as taking supplements (Vitamin A, Pantothenic Acid) would be.  First I thought this was your mom's counter, but now I'm amazed [deleted] Thank you! My acne started around 4 years ago, and I want to lose it so badly. It's been on and off, but sometimes it just gets horrible and that's when I had enough. I started my journey a few weeks ago.  Heck, there are people WELL beyond their teenage years who still fall for stuff like scrubbing with baking soda and lemon üôÑ  I wish skincare had even been a thing when I was a teenager, all we had was that that blue Clearasil liquid you cleansed your face with.  Many props to you ! I wish I had gotten into skincare when I was younger - wouldn‚Äôt have had to suffer from acne for so long if I had. üòÇ Not rich. Just know where to find good deals. Never will I buy skincare for retail pricing, and a lot of these were on heavy heavy discount.

For instance, 4 cerave tubs, retails 8$ USD each, I got for 16$ basically 4$ each and that's a whole lot of product too.  He probably  just doesnt have many things to pay for. I feel like I could afford more as a teen lol [deleted] Thank you!  I'm looking forward to your Shelfie.  17m, supppp M17 here as well, I'm pretty lucky with reasonably clear skin that just gets dry sometimes. I mostly lurk and occasionally see a relevant post to me with a nice recommendation for a product. I'm always really impressed with how in depth people go with their skincare products, especially at our age. Oh gosh facial hair is the end of me.  Thank you for the suggestion! I'm going soon to my dermatologist. Last time she gave me a tub of tazarotene, which hasn't been doing too well. I may go back to tret. See how that works.

I don't layer too much on my skin, I really only have about 6 steps in the morning. It seems like a lot but I don't use everything here, and not everything is AB.  Does it go on greasy?  Uhhh. What?  Thank you.  Can you explain to me more in depth on how you got rid of your acne. My sister thinks she's going through hormonal acne when it's that time of the month. Her skin is pretty clear ever since she started taking care of it. But gets pimples that are red and inflammed. She has dry and dehydrated skin. These are the products she uses - Vanicream cleanser, hada labo oil cleanser,  tretnoin, altruist 50 spf sunscreen. 
She was using vitamin c and niacinamide before but stopped after starting tretnoin. Right? It's not even a lot just the boxes make it look that way Thank you, happy new year to you! I still have 34 minutes to go for my official new year but thanks man, I hope I can at least get decent skin by mid year!  he deleted a lot of his responses. I'm not, I try and respond to a lot.  But you had amazing music bad in the 80s.  Everyone's skin will be different. The products have definitely been working, and I don't buy them from stores, but rather, from trustworthy buyers on ebay. Whenever I'm not satisfied with a product, I return it and get a refund, or I can negotiate with the seller to get a partial refund.

Not only do I save money but my skin improves.

My skin looked absolutely dull, it was dirty prior to cleansing, it was so oily in my T zone, ever since the product start, I noticed a reduction in Redness, blackheads whiteheads and Brightening of my skin tone.

IF you're really not gonna buy anything, just go for the spf, it's a must to anyone's routine and really helps so that the scars don't get darker.

Did you get rid of your acne, if so, how?  Not sure if it‚Äôs when OP purchased. But there was a Black Friday deal at Sephora....$15US for the tub. If I recall correct, it was around 18 or 19.  Biore Sarasara UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++ 85g (Essence) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791WCWHX/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_v.8kCb6A2YB94 Does it look massive? Looks small to me.  It's doing fine, yeah why wouldn't I? 4 for 16$. Incredible deal imo.  In a word no. However some of us addicts like to have a few in stash.... we just feel, calmer.  Really! Wow. Interesting.  My morning routine is only 6. My night routine is 7.  > A proper skincare regimen needs like 5 products max

Source that everyone's skin only needs 5 products? Really? I‚Äôll have to try this I have some samples. I need a very heavy moisturizer at night to help with the tret.  Haven't tried the Elta yet. Biore is pretty good.  How the literal fuck. Oh my gosh.  Yes you do!!! You made me look but he is there. Ready to hug.  Oh my really?  My personal favorite? I can't be sure yet. The snail bee high content essence probably, I like it slightly more than the cosrx.  I really want to start in the middle. I don't want to start off too weak. I've heard of retinol and niaminacide, but which one would you say is better to reduce acne? I've heard retinol is mostly for anti aging, whereas niaminacide is good but haven't purchased one yet.  I love that stuff  I got mine from Lookfantastic (they offer freeshipping the US btw). It's around $30, but they send out 20% discount code all the time (but you have to sign up an account first). They are very generous with gifts. For example, they're having a deal right now where you spend 30 GBP on FAB, you'll receive a First Aid Beauty Gift package (mini Face Cleanser, Ultra Repair Cream, 5 in 1 Bouncy Mask & Facial Radiance Pads.
 Ebay, they're kinda expensive at 30 ish though. It beats having to pay 60 retail elsewhere though  Same lol I immediately noticed I either have, have had, or am wanting to have nearly 100% of these products üòÇ Can't relate. Tret was good, and it helped slightly, but it wasn't anything special, probably because I didn't cleanse or moisturize 2 years ago when I was on it.

I've tried tret, benzoyl peroxide and more from dermatologists, but it's all just smoothed out my skin a little, it hasn't done too much to eliminate the acne or penetrate the blackheads.

 Ebay.  Rosehip oil Hmm, I don't know it's cute right?  Wow, whats your routine like?  No, i don't know where my mom got it, she thought it was nice and got it.  Lmao, you're welcome.  THANK YOU, and yes you noticed that I kept the packaging. It looks like a lot but it's just the packaging for aesthetic Im 28 and also keep a lot of my packaging, tho nowadays i fold the cartons flat again and store them this is to keep track of the ingredients/version to keep track in case they change the formula (also in my skincare excel document). 

Handy, good bottles when empty i also keep, they are very handy when i dont like the original packaging a product is sold in or when something is flawed (somehow the Cosrx sprays often have issues) then i decant it in another bottle. The Tony Moly wonder Ceramide Mosshi toner comes in a 500ml bottle but i decant that in a smaller empty spray bottle and store the big one.  Of course! Holy grail!  Owning a lot of products doesn't necessarily mean that a person is knowledgeable in the subject? Some people don't seem to think I'm knowledgeable but thank you so much for the support.
 If he just has normal teenager acne why the hell would you want to put him on accutane Many negative side effects I'd prefer not having.  You give terrible advice  You seem really sweet.  I‚Äôm sorry if people didn‚Äôt respond well. It‚Äôs all a learning experience and people do love to share their opinions (including me). Best of luck in your skincare journey.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M just TRYING the products, I'M EXPERIMENTING with my routine gosh. I know I'm trying a lot of things seeing what works, I consume dairy less nowadays, drink more water exercise.

This is the type of constructive criticism that I'm looking for. Thank you. Best wishes to you.  Yasss.  Seasoned? And what do you mean by that? This dresser is really nice and they're all mine, I share none, and the products that don't work for me are given to my sister.  I don‚Äôt care what sort of deals you‚Äôre finding; due to the sheer quantity of products in this picture, you‚Äôre almost certainly wasting money that could be saved or better spent.

Furthermore (and this more objective than other criticisms), I am confident that you are not capable of discerning how every single one of these products is contributing to your skin or what possible interactions are happening due to whatever interactions between products or what have you. In other words: You don‚Äôt know what product is actually doing what when you‚Äôre using these products. Good thing you dont drink nor do drugs as a 16 y.o. 

Im very much about that everyone should absolute do whatever they want, even if they want to buy  100 items or only use la mer, they must do that. I would def. not judge anyone for 15 products, but im very curious how you pay for that as a 16 y.o.? Do you work in the weekends? And how do you order them? Let your parents use you their creditcard or can you have a creditcard at 16 in the USA?  (Im in Europe myself.)  Good for you, you do you!  Don't give in to the negativity, start 2019 with a huge bang.  Hi there,

[deleted] Oh damn, I hadn't seen that until you mentioned it. I'm all for a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and exercising regularly, but that doesn't always cut it. I'm glad some people can get by with just cleanser and a single moisturizer, but that's not the reality for some of us. Personally, my skin loves the hell out of my "excessive" and "unhealthy" and "unnecessary" routine. If OP's enjoying it and it's not making his skin worse, I fail to see the harm. Can't decide. Both must haves.  Um, I dont use all the products listed here on my skin everyday, I'll try and tone down my Shelfie for my next Shelfie and show only the products for my routine.  I JUST ordered it! From the ordinary!  Thank you for the suggestion, any ideas as to what I should exclude?

The acids I see as something potentially problematic, I'm starting at only once a week, then going up if I deem it necessary.  Not necessarily. Different things work for different people. He might be trying to figure out what works for him. No need to be judgemental and call his choices "ridiculous". That's not what this sub is for. That's a pretty bold statement. You don't know if he's tested these each individually for irritation. Most of these products are gentle cleansers and moisturizers which likely wouldn't cause much irritation. If he's seeing progress then more power to him.  I mean, supplements are really hit and miss for a lot of people. Everyone is different.  Just a fair warning, I was just like you at 16 and had access to literally all the products I wanted. In fact I was using a lot of the products you posted. I had flawless skin and then over a period of a month or two I started to get horrid cystic acne. I eventually had to go on accutane and my skin was ruined. It's been a long 2 years of getting it back to normal. I theorize I was either using too much or perhaps one of the products I received was counterfeit and caused an allergic reaction. Now that my skin is back to normal I realized less is more, and my skin is much more normalized when I scaled back. Now I just do essence > toner > serum > sheet mask > moisturizer and don't vary the products. Just sticking to the same products rather than alternating various toners serums ampoules etc.  [deleted] same, when i was a teen i kept using clearasil Ultra which burned my skin and i couldn‚Äôt figure out why it wasn‚Äôt clearing up my acne like it claimed on the bottle >.<  Please share your secrets I really don't have a lot to pay for, I'm really thankful that I'm not in a position where I have to pay rent or work consistently. That said, AP classes aren't a walk in the park, and this privilege  is earned through good grades.  Some of them suck, keep trying. I had to go to three before I found the right one.  I agree, get a second consultation, preferably with an older dermatologist if you haven't already. You are young enough that there is enough time to prevent any damage. Yes, everyone is different, but be wary because your skin routine is long term. Aww I love this SCA *bromance* ‚ò∫Ô∏è I really like the drawer knobs Very true. Very very true.  I went to the dermatologist, and was on Roaccutane for a couple of years. Skin dried up like a mofo, but the Acne went away. Once I came off that I started to get a few pimples here and there, and still had super oily skin.

But I had an Aloe Vera plant in my garden, and a friend told me to use Natural Aloe Vera on my face before I went to bed. I've been doing that now for years, and it's hands down the best decision I've ever made Thanks! Retinol and niaminacide do completely different things. Retinol will help your skin cells turn over faster, so your pores won‚Äôt get clogged as easily, which reduces acne. Because it helps your skin renew itself faster, it also helps to reduce wrinkles, scarring, and brighten skin tone.  Niaminacide is a B vitamin that helps to even skin tone, reduce scarring, and can reduce the appearance of pores by helping your skin regulate oil production. 

If your skin tolerates the BHA well, I would look into a gentle product like Avene Triacneal to apply at night if you‚Äôre new to retinol, and once your skin adjusts to that upgrade to a 1% retinol. I‚Äôm not sure how sensitive your skin is, so you might be able to apply every night or just 3x each week until your skin adapts. You could start the niaminacide anytime and use it during the day or at night. The Cerave Night Cream also has niaminacide as a key ingredient. EBAY, this is genius, how did I not think of this. Thank you and happy new year (wherever you are!) VERY üòç Let's be friends and talk about skincare and other stuff :) I said this based on his detailed routine and the fact that he has some products that I love and use daily. At 16, I didn't even know I had to apply moisturizer after my scrub. Idk man, does normal teenage acne require that many products? I kinda agree with the Accutane poster. Probably be cheaper overall too.  Eat healthy you might be healthy? Thank you.  [deleted] Yes, I believe some moisturizers do expire.  Thank you so much, it's working it's not bad for my skin so I don't see why I'm receiving all this backlash What if you had a gun to your head? Don't get me wrong I think it's great that you're aware and doing something about it. I am just looking out for you, I think at an early age of 16, it may be too soon to apply too many chemicals and acids on your skin. Also, Acne is a part of growing up, what seems horrible now may pass in the future. If you're in your 20s and still have it when I would start worrying more about it, but have you consulted with a doctor about using this lineup? I think you should.

All the best. a huge portion of your routine is anti-aging. That's premature. When I was trying to get my acne under control, i used aqueous cream (like washing your face with moisturizer) and then used salicylic acid every couple of weeks.

this isn't to say you shouldn't be using sunscreen, but be very selective about it. it's the only product worth leaving on your face at this stage.  I'm fairly new to acids as well (been learning a ton thanks to this sub). And I use a gentle one almost every day (currently the lactic acid 10% from ordinary). Been using it for about 2 weeks and I experienced some purging in areas that were really clogged up (nose and chin) but I'm already seeing a difference in texture and vibrancy so I hope you have the same luck!  "Not necessarily" x 30 products = almost certainly. I scrolled down and 80% of the comments say pretty much the same thing I said, so I'm cool with my statement, thanks. >Skin is different for anyone

I did acknowledge that fact. Just wanted to provide OP some leads as they did cure my acne after topical solutions did not.  Completely agree. I used to use 7-10 products daily as a teenager. It ruined my skin and made it so dry that I over produced oils and in turn had terrible acne/skin. Nowadays at 20, I just wash my face with a gentle citrus cleanser, and use ponds extra dry skin moisturizer. Occasionally spritz with rose water, and use tea tree oil as a spot treatment for any zits. Simple really is best for me personally.  Saameee with me! I started early this year, skin went wack from using so many products (in the process I found out I'm no good with niacinamide and hyaluronic acid), then I pulled off everything for a hot minute to allow it to recover by itself. My routine is very light now but my skin is soooo much better now! I have scars from the acne but they're slowly minimizing now, so I'm happier! Agreed. I used to have an extensive skincare routine and I would always break out. I went to the dermatologist and found out I was layering too much on my skin. I put less on my skin now and I‚Äôve stopped breaking out.  I thought I was the only one! This happened to me as well; perfect skin with literally zero pimple did a 180 turn into a volcano eruption. Although i‚Äôm in better places right now, there are still scars on my face from that time. My current routine is also similar to yours, simple and efficient.  I don't understand why I got so many downvotes. Everyone needs to understand that everyone's skin is different just because you layer something and get horrible breakouts doesn't mean I will. That's why I test every single one of the products on a certain area before going head on into my face. I haven't been reacting negatively to anything as my skin isn't prone to anything except acne and overdrying. My skin isn't overly sensitive, that said, it is very picky about what cleanser I use. Some can leave my skin very flaky and dry.  Literally same for me... Except I don't use sheet masks. I think everyone is really coming to the wrong conclusion about how I use these products.

Just because I have them doesn't mean I'll use THEM ALL. It's trial and error.  Do you sleep on your right side or rest your head on your hand on that side? I sleep on my right side and always had worse breakouts on that side of my face. Changing my pillowcase often has helped me a little bit with it, but not sure if this would apply to you! This is me except it's my left cheek! Any break outs or reactions happen mostly on this cheek. And I sleep mostly on my right side and change pillow cases every other night. Do you take dairy? Usually break out on your cheeks is diet related. Try reduce or cut off dairy and keep your routine. See if it changes  Yeah it made my face red and stung.  Tagging along, eagerly waiting  Make sure your college takes your credits! One of my friends took AP Calc and passed the test, but our uni didn't take it as legitimate to skip to calc 2 so they made him start in Algebra again. Just be sure it even hagle with the transfer advisor of the college for those credits! I got an older dermatologist. I went 6 times already or so within the past two years. Hasn't really helped. I'm being serious, if I try and book a different one, my insurance may not cover it.  üòâ  Oh I see I thought you were implying it was ugly. Thank you!  32 year old male post accutane here. Same situation. Went from horrible skin to mostly clear with occasional ones caused by overly dry skin. Happy new years from the east coast of the US, please make sure TO CHECK reviews. Always check them. Buy from sellers with 99 percent or higher reviews.  Sure. Hit me up whenever.  [deleted] Oh boy, you‚Äôre definitely a 16-year-old male. Why would I over a skincare product? This is how I know this su reddit is full of toxicity with the minority being supporters.  No, i actually haven't. Just taken recommendations. They put me on pills that potentially could damage my internal system just to clear up my acne, so I doubt this would be much different, but I hope so.  Many dermatologists recommend tret, which is primarily used for anti aging but also to reduce acne.  I started using strong acids and now I use a gentle one every day. I agree, a gentle one very day can be very effective. However, it does give me rough skin which means I have less natural oils. there's a trade off. What gentle citrus cleaner? I‚Äôm curious bc ‚Äúgentle citrus‚Äù sounds like an oxymoron (I‚Äôm not trying to be rude) Ah!  I just started hyaluronic acid and started getting break outs! I had no idea its not for everyone.  Would you mind explaining what your dermatologist meant? I feel like I‚Äôm layering too much to (compared to a few months ago) the point where my skin is either shedding skin or an all out oil slick. I can even experience both extremes in the same day. The only reason I‚Äôm not currently breaking out is because I‚Äôm on antibiotics and tretinoin. If not for that, my face would be filled with cystic acne and SF. I‚Äôm afraid the excess oil will lead to acne though. 

Did you dermatologist recommend any products to cut out and/or keep it your routine? TIA! Me too!!!! Horrible acne at around 18 years old. I gave up and used ‚Äúthe caveman method‚Äù. My skin cleared completely in a few weeks. Now I have a very minimal and very gentle routine. And I use sunscreen everyday!  I think it has to do with you saying in another comment that you started your "skincare journey" a few weeks ago, but it can take a couple months to see if a product is working for you. You said you know it's working for you though, in the short time you've tried them and I think it leaves some people scratching their heads. And, you know it was a little condescending.  Oh thanks! I hadn't even thought about that!  I have that problem on my left side and that is definitely the issue Thanks! I'm actually in the midst of doing that! I'm post an update in a couple months Buy online, from reputable buyers, whether it be Amazon or eBay, make sure the feedback is above 99 percent.

Try to haggle. Sort items by lowest cost + shipping and wherever there's "make an offer" make sure to make a reasonable offer, nothing too low.

Take advantage of the coupons, this might seem very cheap but many online places have 15 percent coupons or more. Take advantage of that and haul haul haul.  Did he take an aptitude test and have to take Algebra or did he just need an extra math credit or something? I am confused why he would have to take Algebra just because AP calculus didn't transfer. I never actually had to take Algebra or Trig in college, you had to start with Calc 1 to graduate on time Find out which dermatologists your insurance covers. Trust me, they cover more than one.  There's still people who are here who are just learning, and they really don't deserved to be mocked. Everyone moves at their own pace. That being said he does have a point, and you have a right not to take everything everyone says as fact. Differing opinions doesn't make someone an idiot though. >Gosh, how are you on r/skincareaddiction  without this knowledge.

Ironic you say that, because you apparently use cleaners 3 times a day, exfoliators 3 times a day, and then numerous products to restore your skin barrier and remoisture your skin and on top of all that, your extensive skin care routine don't even have a retinoid product....

Listen, it's great that you are proactive in taking care of your skin especially at your age and as a man, but you gotta realize that more doesn't always mean better.  Lol yeah, all of the comments are "I've already done that so I know more than you." Ok then... It was a joke.  These pills are very common, again depending on the severity of the situation. I just think that maybe you should assess the situation before deciding to use so many products. Again speaking out of pure concern for you here. 

You may be interfering with the natural process of your skin during puberty? Of course I could be dead wrong here, but I'd say it's worth looking into. GL Tret is a very good idea and very effective against acne. I used it for years when I had acne.  I use it now for anti-aging.  Haha no I understand. I use the clean and clear morning burst citrus cleanser. It‚Äôs very gentle on my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed but not tight  I mean same, I thought it was something else so it took me so long to get rid of it! Same, I‚Äôve just figured out that it breaks me out too, I‚Äôm glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one.  Since my skin type is oily, my skin naturally produces too much sebum. Putting too much product especially heavy products like creams and oils can clog up your pores. I did a routine similar to OP and I thought buying all the best reviewed products and incorporating them into a routine would lead to good skincare. 

For the AM, my dermatologist recommended a good cleanser, preferably gel consistency, an antioxidant  (vitamin c) and sunscreen (I use Heliocare CF Gel). Then eye cream to finish off.

For the PM, I use the same cleanser again, retinol (atm on 0.2% from the ordinary but I‚Äôm told to gradually move my way up as my skin becomes more tolerant). Then eye cream again.

There it is. Really simple. Some of the products they recommended me were from Skinceuticals and were really expensive so I bought other products that were similar in function but slightly cheaper in price.

For me oil cleansing broke me out so much. I‚Äôm not sure if my skin is allergic, or because the product was bought from eBay. So personally I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that. What‚Äôs the *caveman method*? [deleted] A huge portion of the stuff you get from Amazon or EBay is counterfeit and terrible for your skin. Even if it is sold directly by Amazon. You will be doing yourself more harm than good with this many different products that you can‚Äôt guarantee  the origin. I like YesStyle for Korean skincare if you haven't looked there yet - brilliant sales. Takes a while to arrive though!  Yeah that's bizarre to me - my University only took scores of 4 or higher for calc credit which I didn't get, but I still started out in calc 1.  How do I cleanse three times a day?

I'm confused.

The beauty water "cleanses" but it isn't a cleanser...


I only cleanse twice a day.

Am with one.

PM with two.

I thought that was fine?  I don't use exfoliators three times a day? Where did I point that out?


OHH LMAO. I should've been more clear. I'm not using the BHA or aha every single day, that's probably a once or twice a week thing.


Sorry about that  I haven't gotten everything from the mail yet. Lmao, honestly isn't it hypocritical to warn me about layering and "all these products I'm using" and then telling me to add another one?  Well I definitely know cleansing and toning isnt bad to do when I'm a teen.

I'll see how BHA can affect me... Even though Salicylic Acid is a common acne treatment

I'll look into AHA, Rosehip Oil, and Vitamin C and Snail Bee Essence to see how they may affect my skin.  I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt prescribe something for you.  water Nothing touches your face except a bit of water. And not even much of that. For me, it was a short term solution. It cleared up my acne but my skin still felt dirty. Once all the horrible acne went away I started using very gentle cleansers, my favorite is CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser. I also use a moisturizing sunscreen (EltaMD UV clear) and that‚Äôs it. My skin is clear and I never wear makeup. 

Edit: Everyone‚Äôs skin is different. This worked for me and my acne. It‚Äôs also cheap(free) to try. Took about a month before my skin cleared up completely. It‚Äôs obvious that you think you‚Äôre the smartest person in the world. Take it from someone 20 years older than you who spent over half my life being a condescending bitch and blaming other people for being too sensitive about it: you‚Äôre not nearly as smart as you think you are and you‚Äôre not going to get very far in life acting like this. You can choose how you say things to minimize how much you come off as an asshole. That is true, and the reason why you buy directly from resellers off of Amazon that ship out themselves (and yes you have to do some research - same for eBay) but some reputable stores also set up eBay stores for example!

But yes, be careful where you buy your products from! Hi, genuinely curious, - do you have any evidence these products are being counterfeited? I haven't seen anything damaging thus far, and if it is counterfeit and I found out it's counterfeit, I'll return it. I have 180 days to do so.  No...they‚Äôre suggesting to cut out seemingly superfluous parts of your routine, and then add a retinoid. It wouldn‚Äôt be layering too much with a retinoid if there were a few less other products.  This is the second time round where I was focusing on acne scarring. The first time round I went dermatologist was for acne and they prescribed me antibiotics. I didn‚Äôt like it as it made my lips really dry so I went off it. After a while my acne gradually left on its own but it left a lot of scarring in place so I decided to see another dermatologist again. I have no idea what the comment your replying to said but this is r/murderedbywords  [deleted] https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-amazon-fake-products-plague-smaller-brands-1532001601

Here are a few articles from reputable sources with decent evidence. I learned about the phenomenon via the beauty and salon community, as well as the sex toy reviewer community, believe it or not.

Even buying from a reputable seller doesn‚Äôt always matter, as places like Amazon dump all stock of the same item together, which includes items shipped from and sold by Amazon as well as third party sellers.

And if you look at websites like Wish and Ali Express, the counterfeit versions look really convincing from the outside.

You get what you pay for when you go with deals like this. There‚Äôs a reason they can sell it so cheap. 

I have my own anecdotal experience as well. Trying to save money, I bought my favorite shampoo and conditioner on Amazon. It was obvious the minute I opened them that it was a completely different product. Different scent, look and consistency.  i always order one of these products (Elta MD) from amazon and a couple of times it was fake, which i didn‚Äôt know at the time but i found out later.  it was evidenced by a counterfeit rounded dispenser at the top of the bottle instead of the usual square pump, and the absence of a lot # printed on the bottom of the bottle.  that was a few years ago.  Now they‚Äôre all real though and they‚Äôre an authorized seller  I hope you get your ego in check eventually my dude, make it a resolution  y i k e s Aw shit thats a bummer. So they dump all the stock together, from different sellers, so you have no idea which seller it‚Äôs coming from? First one is behind a paywall, but I read the other two. Not being critical, but they mostly talk about the generic issue of fake products on Amazon, which I am aware of. Only 1 cosmetic brand that I could see, Urban Decay. I did further searching, and sure enough, there seems to be quite a bit of this going on. Seems like mostly more expensive stuff (I got some COSRX recently that was thinner than my last batch, had me wondering). Thanks for the info. Recently ordered some silver hair dye from Amazon and though the tube did say ‚Äúsilver,‚Äù the dye inside was...purple. Lesson learned. When I find the right person, hopefully they'll enlighten me on that, I need to get out of this town.  > I got some COSRX recently that was thinner than my last batch, had me wondering

I've seen reports of this on Reddit (I'll see if I can dig up the links), and when contacted, COSRX confirmed they were real -- at least in the instances I saw. AB companies in particularly are pretty notorious for silent reformulations, changing packaging, typos on packaging, etc.

Edit: I can't find all of the ones I was thinking of, but a couple posts re: suspected COSRX fakes: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8i65sz/discussion_suspected_fake_cosrx_advanced_snail_96/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8ofdzj/product_question_did_i_receive_a_fake_bottle_of/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/86x9eh/discussion_detecting_amazon_fakes/). Personally, I buy my *first* instance of a product from a reputable/authorized seller/retailer (or get a decant or sample from same), then I deal-hunt when I need to replace. That way I know what the "real deal" looks, smells, and feels like and am in a better position to spot potential fakes.  The product said it was meant to dye hair silver and *not* meant for debrassing existing silver hair?  

*I assume you know exactly what you're talking about*, but I've also had hair products and stains called 'Silver blahblahblah' that were purple because they are meant to de-brass silver and platinum hair. Oh nooo. I hope you noticed before you put it on your hair.

My stylist is a Pravana educator who specializes in doing vivid/bright colors. She has a lot of horror stories of clients who bought products off Amazon to save money on hair color and ended up making an absolute mess of themselves. 

I‚Äôm lucky that I have a coworker who is a retired stylist, but keeps her certification up so she can shop at Salon Centric at the severe discount. I get most of my stuff 50% off or less now and it‚Äôs guaranteed to be good. I wouldn't think they'd counterfeit such an inexpensive product, but you never know. Thanks! Oh yeah, it was supposed to be a grayish color, but I can definitely see how that could confuse people! I‚Äôd ordered the same thing before/used authentic ones and knew for sure something was very wrong, hahah. Oh I definitely didn‚Äôt use it! I was actually telling this story to a friend of mine with certification and she was like, ‚Äúdude I can just just order stuff for you‚Äù so I guess this story has a happy ending after all ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  Yeah, you'd think the money would be in counterfeiting something like SKII FTE or Tatcha Water Cream, but in theory it could be a numbers thing (that is, if they can copy it cheap enough and *sell* enough, they could still make a profit). Counterfeit A/K-Beauty is [a thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7lkc4r/news_hong_kong_customs_officials_seize_5200/), unfortunately, but I don't know how widespread it is. :\ Congrats on finding a source! A stylist willing to buy you stuff at a discount is better find than the best pot dealer. 

Just kidding kids, don‚Äôt do drugs. From left to right (I‚Äôll edit in my reviews as I go)

- Kheil‚Äôs butterstick lip treatment: this was an impulse purchase. I don‚Äôt really recommend it, it‚Äôs just bee‚Äôs wax and coconut oil with a high price point. I‚Äôve had it forever though 

- Paula‚Äôs choice resist smoothing primer serum spf 30: this came free with my toner, I usually put it on before my finishing powder, but I‚Äôm not really seeing a difference or why I need it....so i won‚Äôt be replenishing this.

- cerave eye repair cream: really beautiful and inexpensive basic moisturizer, it feels wonderful and finishes nicely

- Paula‚Äôs choice resist moisture renewal oil booster: this makes my skin so so so shiny, I have combination skin so more oil might not be good. But I love how my skin feels after using it, it‚Äôs a softener for sure 

- Paula‚Äôs choice peptide booster: I just got this for discoloration on my nose and brows, it‚Äôs too early to tell if it‚Äôs doing anything

- Hylamide subq anti age serum: I‚Äôm gonna finish the bottle and see how my skin reacts. I don‚Äôt think this is really making any effect on my skin health at all 

- the ordinary argirine solution 10%: same with this, they said it plumps fine lines but when I don‚Äôt wear it I notice my lines are the same. No plumping 

- Olay regenerist micro sculpting eye swirl: I‚Äôm kinda digging this. It‚Äôs about halfway done and I‚Äôve noticed my eye skin is much softer and even now

- Paula‚Äôs choice clinical 1% retinol treatment: this shit is pure magic, after two weeks of use my skin was just transformed, my pores got smaller, my skin started getting firmer, color was more even. People started to compliment my skin tone. I am buying this  forever.

- Paula‚Äôs choice resist advanced replenishing toner: I just got this, my toner is low so I‚Äôm trying this one next

- Paula‚Äôs choice skin perfecting 2% bha liquid: this stuff is magic af too, it‚Äôs becoming a keeper. 

- Paula‚Äôs choice skin balancing pore reducing toner: my first toner ever. It‚Äôs almost out and I‚Äôve noticed my skin is markedly cleaner and I don‚Äôt have blackheads or breakouts ever since I started using it

- Olay micro sculpting cream with spf 30; I‚Äôm gonna finish this bottle but I don‚Äôt plan on re buying. It‚Äôs just a basic spf with ingredients I already apply in the serums and retinols

- kiss my face farce factor spf 30: yes for life. It‚Äôs sheer, it‚Äôs not greasy, it‚Äôs cheap, and it‚Äôs fragrance free

- the ordinary azelaic acid suspension 10%: I just got this for the discoloration, I‚Äôve only been using it for 3 days. Still too early to tel

- acne.org AHA10%: I LOVE this stuff, I use it 3x a week and it actually stings when I put it on. It‚Äôs such a good exfoliant and it‚Äôs fragrance free

- MAC prep and prime transparent finishing powder : for days when I‚Äôm too shiny, it‚Äôs good stuff What an awesome collection! This is kind of a weird question, but how do you organize/store all of it? I have a similar amount of products but sadly have no bathroom shelf to store them all :( Is that a Wayne White piece I see ? üëåüèΩ As a 38yo guy, I applaud your efforts.

I'm curious, what does your shaving (face) regime look like? In my case it made an even bigger difference than the rest of my efforts.  Frick, is that what it takes?! RIP having nice skin. Patrick Bateman? [deleted] wow I just use vaseline. Nice to meet you, Patrick Bateman 32 here. If you had to narrow this down to two or three things, what would they be? I'm not as worried about wrinkles as I am the way the skin looks itself. Are there certain habits you find important? Do you put stuff anywhere besides your face? I'm concerned about my chest as well.  Oh how I wish Paula's toners would work on my face, they all cause irritation, even the "sensitive" skin ones! Kiss My Face is my holy grail sunscreen. I love seeing other people give it love! 

It‚Äôs really great for dry skin people. When I put it on I can feel the hydration, it‚Äôs blends out quick and smooth, leave a little or no white cast and it has anti oxidants and good active ingredients. Plus vegan and cruelty free. I sound like such a shill lmao (I‚Äôm not) but y‚Äôall this sunscreen rocks.  Does the Kiss My Face spf leave any kind of a white cast?  The Paula's Choice 1 &#37; retinol is one of my faves, also. I have it on rotation with the 1.0 in squalane from The Ordinary and the 0.5 from MUAC and Platinum Skincare: once your skin gets acclimated to those higher concentrations of retinol \(0.5 to 1.0\), they really can can work some magic ! Good looking shelfie. What do you think about the Paula‚Äôs Choice products? Haven‚Äôt tried them yet. Two thumbs up for the sunscreen.  [deleted] now there‚Äôs a place i‚Äôd be down for a sleepover lol


lm rly curious about Payla‚Äôs Choice but it‚Äôs not available in my country so i try to steer clear from what i don‚Äôt have on demand  Meanwhile I can't convince my boyfriend to put on moisturiser. Please provide Sunday to Sunday Am and Pm regimen.

Ive never taken care of my skin.


Soap and lotion call it a day.

After a few acne breakouts... I'm scared..


I need a bullet proof regimen  What a great lineup! Jealous  [deleted] Oooooh, I had been on the fence about the PC retinol even though I've had so much success with the BHA and AHA liquids and lotions I've used. You may have just convinced me to give it a try after I'm through with my Clinique! Nice! I actually really like Kiehls butterstick due to the color and the spf. I have a couple of the tinted versions - I like that I can reapply some color to my lips while also reapplying spf 25.  the wayne white tray! This post is just what I needed to see today! I was thiiss close to purchasing The Ordinary today \- but have decided to go with Paula's Choice instead. I just ordered the CLINICAL 1&#37; Retinol Treatment and Skin Perfecting 2&#37; BHA Liquid, and I'm so excited! Thanks for sharing your recommendations :\-\) Kiehl‚Äôs butterstick contains no beeswax but does contain lemon butter and spf 25 - both great for your skin I've been reluctant in trying Paula's Choice products for quite a while but this post has made the final decision for me. I also have combination skin so I am gonna buy all the Paula's Choice you have here man!  I bet you‚Äôre pretty.  Post your skin dawg.

This post is irrelevant otherwise. Do I find it lasts throughout the day, especially now in the summer months?  Txs Serious question: Does Paula‚Äôs Choice live up to the hype? I bought their products a few years ago and they smelled so awful I couldn‚Äôt even put it on my face without having to wash it off minutes later. It burned the insides of my nostrils with how bad it smelled ‚Äî maybe I got a bad batch? It has been years, so I don‚Äôt know...  I might give into the hype.  What makeup do you use such as foundation etc? I am quite pale and can suffer from redness, especially under fluorescent lights. I am going to try the MAC prep and prime to help with skin shine.

Was looking to try foundation powder. How do you apply toner? I have never used any and I am curious when (before cleaning or after) and how do you apply it? I've been using Paula's Choice CLEAR Anti-Redness Exfoliating Solution 2% Salicylic Acid for years, what's the difference between that and the 2% perfecting 2% BHA liquid? I know the latter has more BHAs and tea tree oil, but would switching make a difference?  The kiss my face is HG level for me  Good stuff here I‚Äôve been thinking about getting the cerave eye cream and Paula‚Äôs choice BHA. how does the eye cream work for puffiness? 34 male here too.  I just did 2 months of research and just placed a 321$ order a few minutes ago...but I get 18 products.  Joining AsianBeauty has opened my eyes to so many new things.  I have high hopes for the 7 skin method once I get my order...  I still look like I'm in my mid 20's but I've noticed some change in my skin and I knew that it was time for a change of routine.  I hope to treat my PIE now that I learned that I don't have PIH and have been wasting a ton of money on treating PIH.  I am jealous of the azelaic acid (in Canada and it's no longer avail here).  Even if Brandon is a tad not all there in his head, I really want that product.  I will need a prescription to get azelaic acid.  So stupid.  Oh well.  

Wishing everyone good skin health! What is azelic acid?

Is Paula‚Äôs choice just for dudes? Does it actually help with fine lines? 

Thanks! [deleted] as a guy of similar age, thanks for the info.

semi recently discovered this subreddit and so far have determined that i probably dont have fungal acne and was trying to decide what to try next. 

Sounds like you find these two work particularly well for you?

Paula‚Äôs choice clinical 1% retinol treatment

Paula‚Äôs choice skin perfecting 2% bha liquid

Do you mind sharing when about in your routine you use these?

 That Paula‚Äôs Choice 2% BHA changed my life. It‚Äôs actually magical. Love everything I try from PC. Going to buy that Clinical 1% Retinol next.  Mac prep powder, is this something u put on with a brush or does it come with a sponge and u just apply that way? Greasy here some days too and if this works throughout the day I might want to try it.  If you like how the Paula‚Äôs Choice renewal oil boost makes your skin feel but think it makes you too oily, I‚Äôd try pure Squalane oil. It‚Äôs a main ingredient in a lot of Khiel‚Äôs lotions and I liked how their body lotion made my skin feel. I first tried it alone in Peter Thomas Roth‚Äôs Oilless Oil because it was advertised as an oil suitable for oily skin and I wanted a bit more hydration than my moisturizer was providing. I really like how it makes my skin feel. According to [this article](https://beautyeditor.ca/2017/02/22/squalane) it‚Äôs also better for aging skin than a lot of the inexpensive oils in the Paula‚Äôs Choice mixture. The Ordinary sells a very inexpensive Squalane oil. 

Edit: Also, Jack Black brand has some great products and is geared toward men. Their lip balms are my favorite. I keep the Shea butter one on my bedside table to use before bed and keep another on me during the day. The beard lube shaving cream is my husband‚Äôs favorite. Their face washes aren‚Äôt stripping when I‚Äôve tried them. I recently tried a sample of the clean-break oil free moisturizer and while I didn‚Äôt love it by itself it was amazing mixed with CeraVe PM as a daytime moisturizer and I think I‚Äôm going to break down and buy a full bottle. I want the Kiss My Face! Gonna finally pull the trigger, thank you. Thanks for the details! Had to pause reading your comment to buy the retinol then come back and keep reading haha Have you tried any micellar water ? Thanks man. Man 33 here and I've been looking for a skin care regimen. Awesome stack.  [deleted] Haha I have a dopp bag I keep everything in. I‚Äôm in the same boat, tiny nyc apartment. Limited shelf space.  You could always buy a little floating wall shelf. That's what my dude uses.  They sell some nice ones at target  Check out the pantry organization sections. The tiered non slip things are good (on surface or on a floating shelf) as are the smaller lazy susan type spinning plates.  As a another 30 year old man, bought a rack just for skincare stuff. Nice catch! [fish‚Äôs eddy ](https://fishseddy.com/collections/wayne-whites-word-paintings) here in nyc has a bunch of stuff with his paintings on it I came in here to make sure that didn‚Äôt go unappreciated! I love Wayne  That was my first question too haha  I shave with an electric razor and no guard. The only thing I shave with a straight edge is my neck....and I use like...noxema shave cream.

I got the toner specifically for my beard area, oil has a way of building up there and it‚Äôs done a great job of controlling it.

Any recommendations for that? [deleted] Face wash, moisturizer and sunscreen are the absolute essentials.  An exfoliant would be really good too as it helps remove dead skin cells/cell turnover.  If you do not want to play with acids, use a gommage. I do not like manual exfoliation as it can cause microtears in the skin but a gommage is safer than let's say St-Ives apricot scrub.  Avene has a soft one. 
 Sorry, but who's Patrick Bateman? Hyaluronic acid is a great moisturizer! Keep it up!

I don‚Äôt specifically moisturize because where I live it‚Äôs fairly humid and I don‚Äôt necessarily suffer from dry skin. 

That being said, the serums, toners, spf and retinols I use all have great moisturizers in them  Oh! And to answer your question, id wash, tone, use the serums and then the gel and then add my spf on top. 

The general rule of thumb is that you build according to how thick/thin the product is.

I use the hylamide serum (the little purple dropper) to moisturize when I need to.  Yep! I‚Äôd say cleanser, toner (with a chemical exfoliant like BHA or AHA), retinol, spf

I don‚Äôt put anything on my chest, just my neck and face  Not as bad as others that I‚Äôve tried, once it dries it goes away though.  Paula‚Äôs choice products are what turned my skincare addiction on in the first place. I read on here that I needed a retinol for wrinkles, spent a good amount of leg work to try to find the best one, and Paula‚Äôs choice ended up on top. I‚Äôve tried tons of stuff and never saw results, within a week of using her retinol is became a convert, it‚Äôs phenomenal.  The retinol, it is a game changer  Everybody‚Äôs skin is different, every environment is different, every season is different. 

I can‚Äôt recommend you my regiment because I‚Äôm targeting signs of aging, large pores and discoloration. You seem to want to target acne.

Take a look at beautypedia, you can get great, inexpensive products.

You‚Äôll want a mild, non irritating cleanser, and a toner (it kinda gets applied like a clearasil pad), the issue with soap is that it washes dirt and debris off, and that‚Äôs fine, however you now have soap on your face (even if you‚Äôve washed it off it‚Äôs still there) so you need to get it off with cotton rounds, worh a few drops of toner on it to help give you skin some moisture, 

Then (if acne is an issue) you‚Äôll want to exfoliate, DO NOT GET EXFOLIATING SCRUBS they scratch your skin and make things worse, go with an aha or a bha, then get SPF and over do it.

At night do the same thing, but instead of SPF apply a retinol, which is also good for acne

If you live in a drier environment you might want a serum high in [hyaluronic acid](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/anti-aging-wrinkles/how-hyaluronic-acid-benefits-skin.html) - alternatively if you live in a high humidity environment you‚Äôll probably have a lighter skincare routine.

Hopefully that‚Äôs a good jumping off point for you  There‚Äôs maybe 4 deceim stores in nyc. 

I dunno about them though, the products are cool but I‚Äôm not seeing results [deleted] The 2&#37; BHA from Paula's Choice is what I have right now and it's *amazing*. Works wonders on my combo skin too Which one? I reapply sunscreen maybe twice after my morning routine  It‚Äôs hit or miss. The retinol and Bha are amazing. Everything else is up in the air. I keep reading about peptides and vitamin c so I gave them a shot. The toners are fine, I‚Äôve never used a non PC toner though so I don‚Äôt really know what to compare it to.

The ones that work, work really well.  If my redness is bad I have a sheer foundation from mac that I wear but the redness is starting to even out and my skin tone is appearing much more consistent now. The only makeup I wear is the finishing powder  After cleansing you get those little cotton round pads and you put a few drops of toner on it and you wipe off the excess cleanser and dirt and debris. Stuff is wonderful  I can‚Äôt tell you, I‚Äôve never had an issue with puffy eyes. However I HAVE heard that cold steel ball bearings are good for this. 

[here‚Äôs the beautypedia review for it](https://www.beautypedia.com/skin-care-reviews/by-brand/cerave/_/Eye-Repair-Cream) 

 Cerave is great but it doesn‚Äôt reduce puffiness, it just moisturizes really well.  > What is azelic acid?

It helps with rosacea and acne. [it‚Äôs derived from grains ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/azelaic-acid-for-skin.html) 

 > Is Paula‚Äôs choice just for dudes? Does it actually help with fine lines? 


Nothing is just for dudes, skin is skin and you should have products that‚Äôs address your specific skin‚Äôs issues 

Retinol helps with fine lines. Paula‚Äôs choice just has a really great formulation  I only use 4 products in my daily routine, the rest are for dry winter days, breakouts, redness, sun damage or a particularly gross day outdoors.  Some of them were skin masks.  I clearly am not going to put on 18 products in a day. Yep! I didn‚Äôt post my cleanser because it‚Äôs in the shower and didn‚Äôt feel like getting it buttttt

In the morning I cleanse (Paula‚Äôs choice foamy cleanser) and tone with some cotton rounds and my pore reducing toner, afterwards I put on the bha liquid, and the peptide booster, then I‚Äôll finish with the kiss my face spf 

In the evening I cleanse, tone, bha, peptide booster, retinol

Putting retinol on during the day, even if I put sunscreen over it, irritates my skin. 

I don‚Äôt usually have acne issues unless i eat greasy foods, but in the rare occasion I do have a breakout my routine shifts to remove all grease and excess skin, that‚Äôs when I bring in my acne.org AHA I‚Äôd second the Paula‚Äôs Choice 2% BHA liquid, I‚Äôve re-purchased this a few times and it‚Äôs not terribly expensive. A few weeks after I first started using it, people started complimenting me on my skin for the first time in my life. Total HG for my routine.  Here's some unsolicited motherly advice \- PLEASE ADD SPF to your routine if you haven't already! Yes!!!!! After a few weeks of using it I have to double check that my eyes aren‚Äôt playing tricks on me or that the lighting in the bathroom isn‚Äôt extra flattering. 

I can‚Äôt wait until you see what the retinol does. I‚Äôm so excited for you  Ummm, I got some of those powder puff applicator things that live in the compact with it.

But you can apply it with a brush too I‚Äôm sure  prep + prime doesn‚Äôt come with applicators but synthetic brushes as well as powder puffs work well on it 
beauty blenders or sponges not so much  Be careful! They have another product with a similar name, [you want this one](https://www.beautypedia.com/skin-care-reviews/by-brand/kiss-my-face/_/Face-Plus-Neck-Face-Factor-30-Broad-Spectrum-SPF-30)  What? All sunscreens are identical, it‚Äôs what manufacturers add to them that make them more/less beneficial or irritating 

Also ‚Äúyou really only need‚Äù is a bit presumptuous isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm doing far more than anti aging with my routine, sunscreen is a massive part of my day, but so is controlling my eczema and discoloration.

Also: retinol is the gold standard of ani aging with [multiple published and peer reviewed studies proving its efficacy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699641/) . Why would I stop using it? Why can‚Äôt I use both?  [deleted] Lower jaw or neck? My husband uses a physical exfoliant for his beard area, currently it's exfolikate by Kate Somerville. He also doesn't put sunscreen on his neck because he hasn't found one light enough yet. He finds it works better than only using a chemical exfoliant. Great review of products, thanks  Interesting.
I've not had a beard for many years.
I had to move away from my electric razor due to constant ingrown hairs and acne.
I moved to a double-edge razor and haven't looked back. It took a few months, but improved my skin significantly. 

When you say straight-edge, do you mean a cut-throat razor? If so, I can't help much as I haven't tried them yet. Otherwise, I find a DE (and good shave-soap) pretty effective

Good work on the toner. It's simple but underrated.

In regards to the oil-buildup: Hmmm. I'm afraid my beard was in my pre-skincare days.
But, I think /r/wetshaving and /r/wicked_edge should have some sage advice in that area.  Haha, 5 years ago all I had was face wash and lotion.  Thank you for the advice. It comes at a perfect time too, I finally sat down and started making a plan, a good exfoliant being top of the list. He‚Äôs simply not there. Look up American Psycho I‚Äôve been using TO‚Äôs retinol. I‚Äôll have to give Paula‚Äôs Choice a try.  [deleted] Wait did you say exfoliating scrubs are bad? I use a cheap Neutrogena micro dermabrasion kit I ordered off Amazon. Do you suggest I scrap it and switch to chemical? I don't have acne but I use it for targeting pores and uneven (excess?) skin texture. Would AHA work for that?  I‚Äôd also like to know this. I have both and use the AHA way more. But everyone loves the BHA. Wondering if I can use both, one AM, one PM?  Oh my now I have to go buy them all The Mac? Thanks so much! I am definitely considering the ones in your photo. :) Brilliant thanks! Have just ordered some along with your arsenal of PC products. Have been using TO but can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen much result. And what do you do after that? I tried a toner once and it made my skin very sticky, i guess it was bad :d I‚Äôm definitely going to try it then. I‚Äôve had good results with other retinoids but I‚Äôm looking for the best of the best to get even more dramatic results. And a good sunscreen of course, especially this time of year. Thanks for posting your regimen! I do first wash with oil based wash (sherbert) if I sweat or worse sunscreen or makeup.  Then I do my second wash with a gel wash.  After that, I use my preparation essence.  I go between two of them (one has mandelic acid and I do not want to use it every day).  Then I use my moisturizing toner and will do 3 skins usually.  I have 6 serums and I will go with whatever is appropriate for the time of the day and how my skin feels.  I may add an oil or not. Depending on the need, I will moisturize.  I don't usually need to in the summer.  

There are masks (sheet, washoff) and acids that need to be rotated.

There is of course sunscreen when exposed to the sun.  There's also my cushion if I need to cover something.  The masks are as needed and of course, depending on the type, it can replace a/some serums.

It's not all that many products each time.  It's about finding what is right for the season (winter is dryer, etc...) and for the day (I'm not going to do a peel every day for example and when I do, I need to skip other things that could irritate and want something more soothing.  I have been taking care of my skin since I was 12 so I'm learned quite a bit over time.  Skin needs change and I know what my issues can be depending on the day, the weather... so I try to have what I need for when I need it.  It seems like a lot if someone saw all of my products but some are used once a week.  Others when I have time (like a sheet mask).   It's different for everyone and it's about finding what works for all of us.  10 years ago, have 3 different toners in the house would have seemed stupid and a waste of money.  Now, I use one or two more often and use the other one on a specific day with a specific routine.  I'll be 35 in Sept and I'm starting to notice small changes.  I just did an overhaul of my skincare.  It's always easier to prevent problems than to treat them. There‚Äôs no point in using retinol during the day, UV rays make it useless, so keep it for nighttime only. thanks! just ordered it :P With all the controversy with the ordinary some people aren't buying their products...however if that doesn't bother you...their glycolic 7% toning solution is incredible. I switched it out for the Paul's choice bha, and have had multiple comments that my skin looks glowly. It's 7¬£ in the UK compared to ¬£26 from PC I just bought it. It's been 2 weeks I think? Already noticing a difference for sure. Would you say the liquid or gel is best? Heard good things about both.  There is an spf30 in the list for everyday.  I just ordered The a Paula‚Äôs Choice BHA from reading this positivity. I figured I might as well try it. On the site they are having a ‚Äú3 day only anniversary set deal‚Äù  of a bunch of different products. Thanks for the heads up! Always learning something ( and spending money) when I jump on here! Ok I‚Äôm a total noob at this skincare deal. What exactly does the BHA do again? I feel like I have similar skincare concerns as you (enlarged pores, uneven skin tone) would that be good for my skin concern? Just my 2 cents‚Äî I apply it with a damp beauty blender and after a few minutes, dust off any excess with a brush.  Do you purchase this product in any chain stores? Also in New York, hoping to be able to pick it up without ordering online  You are amazing! My ageless face thanks you :)  [Is this not the same product?](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0014C8COY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_z29eBb5561FZ2) Thanks for your time! [deleted] Lol? Haha Olay Whips sunscreen moisturizer is super light & might be worth a try. I am allergic to one of the ingredients but I gave it to my step dad & he loves it for his neck & under his chin. It's scent isn't the *best* but it's lighter than most SPF/moisturizers. BTW: I've found out the hard way that none of the supermarket brands of shave soap are any good for me. They all give me terrible skin irritation.
I had to follow the /r/wetshaving examples before I stopped dreading my shaves.  It's better than most people skincare routine. The ordinary has chemical exfoliants.  I prefer them to anything that you scrub on your skin because they can cause microtears.  However, if it's something that you're wanting to do, start slow.  Patch test an area of your skin to make sure that you're not reacting badly.  Also, start with the lower percentages.  THeir Mandelic Acid 10% + HA might be a good place to start.  Mandelic acid is a bigger molecule and it provides gentle exfoliation.  It would not be something to do every day.  Same thing for a gommage if you choose to go that way.  For a face wash, if you want something not too expensive that is actually good, CeraVie has ceramides, cholesterol and many other great ingredients that our skin starts to produce more slowly as we age.  Exfoliating is great but you need to keep your skin's barrier strong.  It will protect from early wrinkling and other damage that can be caused by the environment.  Sunscreen needs to be applied all the time when you go out.  Skin cancer is no joke and the sun can damage your skin and burn you pretty badly if you start to use an acid.  If you have any questions, don't be shy. You just lost me. I gotta say tho. If blackheads and sensitivity are a concern I‚Äôd go with the pore reducing toner and a trial size of the retinol. The toner is a great way to control oil and clean out blackheads, and it‚Äôs mild so it won‚Äôt irritate too much.

Good luck!  Exfoliating scrubs are usually ground up seeds or shells or sand or plastic that just kinda scratch the surface of your face, some of them are so harsh they actually cause micro tears in your skin.

You don‚Äôt have to mechanically scrub your face to rid its excess dead skin when there are perfectly formulated chemicals that do it on a deeper level for you, and are formulated with skin soothing ingredients to encourage healing.

If you routinely and regularly exfoliate (chemically) your small bumpy patch will even out over time 

Also; microdermabrasion is a procedure that should be carried out by a doctor, not a cheap amazon kit.

If price is a concern you can find a good chemical exfoliant from the ordinary, they have a peel that‚Äôs illegal in a few countries because it‚Äôs so strong, and they recommend you only do it once a week. Maybe it might be good to hyper target your patch I‚Äôve used the BHA liquids with salicylic acid and the AHA 8% with glycolic acid lotion from PC. I love them both but found that I can‚Äôt use them together ‚Äî my face feels like it‚Äôs on fire to the point where I‚Äôve felt it‚Äôs unbearable. I have found success with using the AHA e/o day and using BHA in the AM all days. On nights I use AHA I skip BHA!
Hope this was helpful :) lol! Get a good sunscreen too. Your skin \(and future younger looking you\) will thank you :\) The Mac lasts for maybe 4 hours. Which is fine Because I‚Äôm rarely shiny for longer than that  Yeah it shouldnt make your skin sticky

After that you start your regiment, starting with the most fluid textured stuff to the more thicker creams

So. Serums go on next, then oils, then spfs or retinoids  I‚Äôve heard this, I wonder (and I haven‚Äôt done my research) if it also makes your skin more susceptible to sun damage? If I wear it at all during the day I get fried by the evening. It‚Äôs like a magnifying glass What is the controversy with TO? Hmmm good to know! That‚Äôs my only complaint with PC is having to pay shipping & waiting. TO just opened a location near me so maybe I‚Äôll check out the glycolic solution.  I personally prefer the liquid. I just put 2 or 3 drops in the palm of my hand and apply it directly to my face with my fingers (so I don‚Äôt waste product using a cotton swab). A bottle of the liquid lasts me approx 3 months minimum applying it 2x a day this way.  BHA is a chemical exfoliant. As you age your natural exfoliation process slows down or even stops, so it‚Äôs important to gently help the process along, 

Exfoliating is associated with harsh scrubs and like....ground seeds and stuff. All of those things scratch the skin and can‚Äôt really dig down into the pores to get the dead skin out. BHA is oil loving and is small enough to get inside your pores to help you remove dead skin! So your pores end up smaller, you reveal more new skin cells, which  evens skin tone over time. 

It‚Äôs super important to exfoliate as you age 

[here‚Äôs an article that gives all the details ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/paulas-choice-product-tips/difference-between-aha-and-bha-exfoliants.html)  if it works for you it works for you! that‚Äôs my take on any of these things v

sounds like you‚Äôre describing a good ol‚Äô bake but id say for baking get a loose powder and then damp beauty blender etc I THINK they sell it at Whole Foods  That‚Äôs the one! You want to avoid the face factor spf50 with lavender yeah, I only have it on my temples and under my nose. I avoid using it in those areas.

hyaluronic and azelaic acid are doing wonders for it though   Any favorite soaps? I just started using some Stirling soaps and I‚Äôve been impressed. Before that I only used Arko.  Gonna scrap my kit asap. Thanks for the info!  Very helpful. Thank you! Ah yeah I am looking for a good sunscreen that doesn't make my face looks like I just leave the shower. No luck so far )):  Oh, didn‚Äôt know about that fluid order. Thanks for such advice.

I‚Äôm gonna try to start using toner and see how my pores do. Can you recommend any toner brands that are accesible in Poland? (Shipping from US is quite expensive for small things) If you‚Äôre using retinol at any moment, you have to be anal about sunscreen and sun protection. SPF 30-50, make sure you apply the appropriate amount (it seems that most people apply only about a third of it, which reduces the protection considerably) and reapply every 2 hours of cumulative sun exposure. 

I would imagine that using retinol during the day would sensitize your skin even more to sun-rays, but again, I never looked into it because I know from a dermatologist source that it‚Äôs pointless doing that. So Brandon the owner has been very expressive on both his personal and TO Instagram accounts and people don't seem to be overly pleased with the behaviour. Imo the products are great and affordable...so he should just be left to express himself (just my opinion though, I really don't want any backlash from this). Check out his ig and some of the comments if you want to look. 
There is also a whole string of things on the internet if you google Brandon/ TO  Yeah each to their own, for me their products are great. I love the bha aha peel...that works a treat, as well as the glycolic 7%... it's so cheap I literally use it at night over most of my body (wouldn't dream to do that with the pc one!) I think it is working far better than the pc if I'm honest, it's worth trying!  Awesome thanks! Definitely worth the money then if it lasts that long :) This sounds amazing! Okay, now you have me excited to try Paula‚Äôs Choice. Heres my idea on the routine I have in mind, please tell me your thoughts: 

AM:
RESIST Perfectly Balanced Foaming Cleanser
RESIST Weightless Advanced Repairing Toner
Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid
RESIST Super-Light Wrinkle Defense SPF 30

PM:
RESIST Perfectly Balanced Foaming Cleanser
RESIST Weightless Advanced Repairing Toner
RESIST Omega+ Complex Serum
RESIST Barrier Repair Moisturizer with Retinol 

Thoughts?! :) Also, do you use the BHA twice a day or just once?  [deleted] Awesome! Thanks mate. Picking it up today Lately I've been using APR and Barrister&Mann. I'm also about to order some Declation/ChatillonLux.
I'm also quite fond of ShaverHeaven and Squadron. 

I hear good things about Stirling and Arko. But, I've not used them.  The kiss my face one I have is great! If it‚Äôs too much look into primers with spf30 or above. They make the skin have a nice finish to it.

Search on beautypedia to find the best one for you and your price point  No problem! [Clinique](https://www.beautypedia.com/skin-care-reviews/by-brand/clinique/_/Even-Better-Essence-Lotion-Very-Dry-Combination)  makes a few that are well reviewed and don‚Äôt contain alcohol and fragrance. Seem to be reasonably priced as well! Good luck!  Once per day is more than enough, but make sure you build up to this, start with 2 uses/week, increase weekly until you find the sweet spot. If you introduce retinol in the evening, keep the BHA in the morning. Wow that sounds like an awesome routine! Exfoliating, moisturizing, spf and repair, You got it down. 
I think her site has a routine recommendation quiz thing too. Also! You can call them and they‚Äôll ask you questions to recommend a routine 

The key is to experiment, know what is good for your skin, and  see what works for you. Be skeptical of all claims and check beautypedia before you buy. 

Good luck! Let us know how it went  Oh; I use the BHA twice a day, my skin lets me know if I‚Äôm over exfoliating and I‚Äôll relax for a few days and switch to once a day. 

It all depends on the weather, what I‚Äôve been doing etc 
 It depends on what you‚Äôre targeting, they‚Äôre both exfoliants but they do things differently. Aha is good for surface level damage, bha is good for deeper below the surface damage 

I don‚Äôt put all of them on, my daily routine is wash, tone, bha, serum, spf/retinol 

if I spent a lot of time outdoors running or biking I‚Äôll apply the aha that evening, or if it‚Äôs a low humidity day I‚Äôll apply the oil and some hylamide for extra moisture.  Stirling is awesome! Arko smells....like a urinal cake, it lathers like a dream but damn does it make my face feel super dry afterwards.  I've had the best luck with B&M, Stirling and TOBS.  Based on performance, ease of lathering, scent and face reactions, TOBS Eton College wins but all Stirling and B&M soaps are a very near second. Thanks, I‚Äôll keep those in mind.  Thank you! Thanks a lot for help! Have a good one! Ok, great! So, you can overdo it with the BHA? What is the sweet spot for you?  Okay, thanks so much for all the info! I just recently have started caring more about my skincare (turning 30 soon) and appreciate all the advice!  Agreed about Arko. I haven‚Äôt tried TOBS, but it seems so popular I better keep some on hand just because. Stirling‚Äôs Executive Man scent is great.  Yes, you can. From my experience, PC‚Äôs BHA is very well formulated, so it‚Äôs unlikely to get irritation from it, but when I first started using it (before finding ScA), it did dry up my skin with daily use.

Now I use it about 3 times per week, but if I get some acne, I increase to daily use. It is impressive how fast it gets rid of it.  **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* What's the brush and bowl set-up used for? I love the presentation / display, very neat and clean. What kind of plant is that? This has made me realize I need a plant in my bathroom! The total price of all these products is probably close to the price of my car. where is that display stand from?? it looks great!! That‚Äôs an amazing collection! *cries in poor*

How do you find the essence from Tatcha and how do you incorporate it into your skincare routine? Over the past few years, I‚Äôve fallen in love with skincare so I wanted to display my go-to‚Äôs for my morning and night routine, along with my weeklies. 




AM Routine

Cleanse with water

COSRX Low PH Barrier Mist

Lanc√¥me Genefique Serum

Skinceuticals C E Ferulic 

Lanc√¥me Genefique Yeux Eye Cream

SK II RNA Moisturizer

Sunscreen (not pictured)






PM Routine

Huangisoo Oil Cleanser (Got this from Costco and it is the best oil cleanser I have ever used!) 

Tatcha Calming Rice Polish (The brush and bowl on the left is used for the rice polish. The brush is super soft and makes an awesome foam with the polish. The set hails from the Japanese tradition of making green tea.)

Essence/Toner (Most of the products on my shelf are essences that I have decanted into spray bottles‚ÄîI find that it preserves more product than to use a cotton pad. These include AmorePacific Vintage Green Tea, Origins Mega Mushroom, and SK II Pitera Essence.) 

Lanc√¥me Genefique Serum

Creme de La Mer

Glow Recipe Avocado Melt Retinol Eye Sleeping Mask

Laniege Lip Sleeping Mask 






Products that I use once a week or rotate in from time to time:

Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Night Serum

BR P50V 1970 (The more sensitive formula) 

Peter Thomas Roth Niacinamide Discoloration Treatment

Tatcha the Water Gel (Mostly in the summer)

La Mer the Treatment Lotion

AmorePacific Sleeping Recovery Mask (The best!) I love the toner in the little spray bottles. I love this idea! Do you remember where you got those spray bottles? They are so sleek and pretty!

ETA: I'm talking about the 3 bottles on the right on the middle shelf. I hate myself for loving the TLC serum but I just can‚Äôt find anything that works like it. Awesome! Which product would you say is your HG or the one that absolutely made the biggest difference for your skin? This post called me broke in 20 different languages Esthetician here! I‚Äôm OBSESSED with the skinceuticals ce ferulic. I‚Äôve tried probably 15 other vitamin c serums and none compare. That said- I wish it didn‚Äôt smell like hot dog water! That‚Äôs the most off putting part to me and my clients- imagine the end of a lovely, relaxing facial, only to have your person start rubbing in a liquid with a similar aroma to the inside of a weinerschnitzel. this is goals. 

where did you get the shelf? Cries in poor Gosh this picture makes me so happy lol. Nothing better than being organized + skincare It‚Äôs beautiful omg Wow! Do you find spending $350+ on a tiny moisturizer to be worth it? Where did you get your spray bottles from? I adore your little shelf and the brush hanger-upperer thingie! I have clear plastic shelf but it has compartments and I much prefer yours. How do you like the Peter Thomas Roth niacinamide discoloration treatment? I‚Äôve been hesitating to buy it! yayyy someone else who loves the TLC serum!! its been a staple in my skincare ever since it came out :D especially cause i haven't found anything that works as well as it does for me lol I bought the Tatcha Essence on a whim and then had immediate regret like wtf did I spend that much on something I‚Äôll probably never use. 

Turns out it‚Äôs one of my absolute favorite products! Your stash looks a lot like mine, I love it! Fuck me. This post just spit on me and called me poor Tatcha üòç Does this actually make a difference from a basic face wash and moisturiser? Wow, your setup looks amazing!  Much more organized than mine üòÖüòÖ This is major goals You‚Äôre speaking my language here!!!! I love this!! Do you like the Tatcha essence more than SKII?You decant your SKII essence in the spray bottles???? Why....have I never thought to do this. Also how do you apply the BR P50? I‚Äôve been using a shiseido cotton square but recently read you‚Äôre supposed to pat it in ü§î Love the display and very curious about some of these products.

Don't understand why people are being so annoying with the price of products. I'm sure if we all could afford them we'd all want to try them. Personally I've had the opportunity to try some high end products like Sisley and Sensai and even though most of my routine is made by low-mid range products, you really get what you pay for with some products. People can spend their money how they want, OP is not shoving it in your face, but sharing her passion like anybody else on this sub. You just inspired me to organise my products like this too! Had to DIY the elevated bits but it's looking nice :) Is the stand where you hang the tatcha brush from amazon or does it come in a set? üß° love the set up I zoomed in and started humming the Halo theme lol This shelfie calls me poor üòÖ You don‚Äôt put any of your products in the fridge? Just asking cause I keep some like Vit C and retinol in the fridge(I got one for my room so I don‚Äôt have to go all the way downstairs) Your set up is so beautiful! Beautiful! This is honestly goals. whew this post just told me how broke I am üòÄüòÇ Where did you get this lovely stand from?üòç Second, I want to know where it‚Äôs from lol! Is the tatcha brush bowl worth it ?? Where did you get those pump bottles? Gorgeous! I'm relaxed just looking at your spa for skincare! üòª PTR treatment review? My heart literally skipped a beat when I saw this picture!! üòõ Wow everything is beautiful! The brush and bowl makes it look extra fancy for some reason The PTR niacinamide is amazing This Shelfie is a dream omg Hey! I‚Äôd love to hear what you think of avocado retinol eye cream! Changes you noticed? How long you‚Äôve been using it for? - anything else you might think is relevant ü•∞ That is so very satisfying, clean, and tidy.  Though it kind of makes me feel cheap about the products I use now.. The one thing I want is the TLC exfoliate serum I wish I had that much shelf space üò≠ love the amore pacific mist! so fresh and smells amazing this is so zen This is art. Also, how do you like the PTR discoloration treatment? I‚Äôve had my eye on that This is beautiful. I am inspired. This photo has excellent lighting Do you like the PTR niacinamide? ID on the liquids in the bottles? oh god, it all looks so magnificent! I've never had shelfie envy... until now. Nice collection! Hey! How do you think Tasha's the essence is helping your skin? I have that product but I haven't been using it lately. maybe your comments would help me to be more diligent‚ò∫Ô∏è this picture called me poor lol All those daily??? I just want to say this is so beautiful. It's set up like art and I would love to do my ritual there. 

My little cupboard will suffice for now, but this picture is goals. Nice collection but maaaaaaybe tone it down a bit for the sake of your wallet, time, and long term skin health? *Cries in college student poor* this photo called me poor üò≠‚ù§ I love that plant! What‚Äôs your face look like though? Isn‚Äôt that the point of this sub? To see what you had going on and what fixed it? I‚Äôm not trying to sound mean or negative, maybe I should see myself out ok. I just don‚Äôt see how this these posts genuinely help anyone except to make them feel inadequate and poor. Maybe I missed a clause in the bylines for show and tell. The Brush of Damoclese hangs above the Bowl of Peril as a warning against complacency. It‚Äôs from Tatcha to use with their rice powder. You add a bit of powder to the bowl, bit of water, then froth it up with the brush and use it. I bought it when it launched a few years back. It was OK but felt next level cheap. Came to ask the same thing Tatcha sells it as a cleansing brush Rice polish Haha to be quite honest, it‚Äôs fake and from Ikea! I‚Äôm not good at keeping things alive. I think the plant with the white pot came to $10? Good buy IMO. Try a ZZ or Sansevieria in your bathroom, they love low light and require little watering! Looks like bay laurel to me :) Look into low light houseplants unless you have good lighting in your bathrooms! It looks like it‚Äôs a spice rack! The kind that looks like a set of steps

Edit: [shelf organizer](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.ca/store/product/copco-non-skid-shelf-organizer/3336196?skuId=12180896&mcid=OS_googlepla&mcid=PS_googlepla_nonbrand__&product_id=12180896&enginename=google&adpos=&creative=340470882603&device=m&matchtype=&network=g&utm_campaignid=71700000049834620&utm_adgroupid=58700004900601667&targetid=92700042356593539&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvb_kpMvV7AIVT_DACh3e_g6HEAQYASABEgLkn_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) cries in poor is too real That is a new buy! I cycle through my essences and it depends on my mood. Usually after I cleanse, I throw on an essence immediately so that my skin is always hydrated‚ÄîAM and PM. So far, the texture is silky and it absorbs nicely. I‚Äôll let you know how it goes after a few more weeks and if I see any difference! That skinceuticals CE+ Ferulic needs to come before the serum. It‚Äôs meant to go on bare skin immediately after washing. If you like the Lanc√¥me Genefique, you should give the Missha Time Revolution Night Repair Probio Ampoule a try. It‚Äôs a fraction of the price and the ingredients are very similar. I actually prefer it to the Lanc√¥me or the EL Advanced Night Repair. So affordable! Lol. Im jealous! How do you find the PTR treatment? I‚Äôve been thinking about grabbing it but haven‚Äôt heard many reviews The brush set reminds me of shaving gear! I might try using my shaving brush with my dermalogica powder exfoliant haha

Also matcha is made using a bamboo whisk called a chasen! Not a brush How‚Äôs the SKII RNA moisturiser? I love the whole aesthetic of your skincare shelf by the way, fantastic job! Was looking for those bottles as well! Searched on amazon for skincare spray bottles and found some that looked similar to OP‚Äôs! [similar spray bottles](https://www.amazon.com/Refillable-Containers-Skincare-Perfumes-Cosmetic/dp/B07TBLJFJM/ref=sr_1_51?dchild=1&keywords=skin+care+spray+bottles&qid=1603825843&sr=8-51) Yep, they‚Äôre from Amazon! They‚Äôre nice little bottles and the spray is pretty fine. Not exactly the same but I bought a little amethyst serum roller from sephora and put my caffeine solution in it. I love it, it's gentler than massaging my undereyes with my pinky finger. Pretty sure I have the same ones. Just look for spray bottles on amazon :) super affordable I love it too but it‚Äôs a little strong for me. I use it maybe once a week or two. Especially when I feel like my pores are congested. I wanted to love it so much but DE products irritated my skin. Same. It just works SO well for me. I can use it multiple times per week with no issues and my skin is super smooth where I'd normally break out. Sadly, the Skinceuticals C E Ferulic I think is awesome and the best vitamin C that I‚Äôve ever used. I definitely can see a difference. It makes my skin more even-toned and gives me a glow. It also does not irritate my sensitive skin. I say sadly because the price point is ridiculous‚Äîhence why I have little samples. (Shoutout to my facialist for hooking me up with free samples every time! Lol) Also, it smells like hot dog water. But anything for a glow, amirite?

I also love the COSRX Low PH Barrier Mist. It‚Äôs soothing, moisturizing and protective. I go through these little misters like water.

I really like the Tatcha Calming Rice Polish too. I was hesitant because I don‚Äôt like physical exfoliants. However, this powder is so fine, I feel no grit or anything while washing my face. It also does not dry out my skin. I find it to be a great second step to my oil cleanse. 

Lastly, the Lanc√¥me Genefique Serum has been one of my favorite serums ever and now my daily. It‚Äôs hydrating and brightening with a unique ingredient: bifidus prebiotics (yes, like in yogurt). I‚Äôm not quite sure why but I feel like it‚Äôs made my skin healthier over the past year. Lmao literally same.

I've been on this sub for about 2 years and am still having such a hard time with my face and really cannot afford any of this stuff - although it calls out to my soul! 

Taking a break right now from actives and am just cleansing and moisturizing to try to start fresh. LOL Search ‚Äúspice shelf‚Äù on Amazon. Following to find out My mom loves the La Mer cream but I told her to purchase the European Nivea Cream and she says it feels the same and wants to submerge her whole body in it lol This is an age old La Mer question. Lol I really do like it and keep coming back to it because it‚Äôs so thick and my skin is crazy dry in the winter. It‚Äôs totally not a necessity though! They look similar to ones I got on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CQH4LN9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_4NhMFbZB56G2J?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1 It definitely does for me. It‚Äôs also part of my rituals in the morning and at night. It‚Äôs kind of just simple ‚Äúme‚Äù time as cheesy as that sounds. Yes, I do with the SK II! It‚Äôs super easy and I feel like less product is wasted. The Tatcha Essence is new so that‚Äôs still up for verdict! However, you know how the SK II has a kind of weird smell? (I mean it is fermented) The Tatcha Essence smells really clean (barely a scent to me) so that‚Äôs a plus. For the P50, I still use the Shiseido cotton pad! My facialist does the same except she folds it in half and uses this fancy swiping motion that‚Äôs really quick and rapid over the skin (kind of like quick dabs all over) so I think you‚Äôre fine! The spa that I go to where my facialist works specializes in BR products so if it works for them, it should work for us! It‚Äôs from Tatcha! It‚Äôs def a splurge as with anything Tatcha but it‚Äôs really beautiful. I‚Äôve thought about it! How do you like it? Amazon! I think like $20? Lol I love it. I‚Äôve been using it more than my Foreo. It does take more time though but I only really cleanse at night. It was packaged so beautifully too! I really like it for the creamy texture and how so little of it goes a long way. I‚Äôve had this jar since March and prob have a month of product left. I‚Äôm still fairly young so I don‚Äôt suffer from crows feet or fine lines around my eyes. I mostly use it for preventative/maintenance. I do think it helps smooth my eyes out in the morning and reduces puffiness and bags. The retinol is strong though so if you are super sensitive, you should work your way up to every night. Not OP, but I notice that my skin is noticeably less hydrated when I don't use it. I‚Äôm genuinely curious if you‚Äôd say the same thing to someone who enjoys expensive wine, or someone who loves to cook with wagyu beef and other premium ingredients, or someone who creates fresh flower arrangements for herself every week?

OP probably spends $1,000-$2,000 a year on beauty. Is that a lot? Sure. But you can spend that much in just a few months on all the other hobbies I mentioned, and all of those involve time, money and packaging waste. 

Maybe skincare brings her the same joy that expensive wine or truffle pasta or rare orchids bring to someone else. Let people enjoy things. Can you explain how this collection affects long term skin health? don't know why you're being downvoted absolutely nobody should be using this amount of stuff I'm removing the majority of this comment chain for veering off-topic. Haha I was there not too long ago! Hang in there and make your dreams come true. no. this sub is to post anything skincare related. I don't need to see someone's face to read opinions and experiences with a product or different routines. would you have made the same comment if the products OP showed weren't high end? This is poetry. Underrated comment Oh woe is me, my life is a misery! That ain't no crime! üé∂ I thought it was a genius brush drying set up. Interesting - thanks for the full explanation! What's the rice powder/froth supposed to do? Says it‚Äôs for rice polish Yep, it‚Äôs from Amazon! Not to sound dumb but why? I use a SkinCeuticals dupe üôà but should I be doing the same thing? I always thought vit c needs to go on bare skin, then I got prescribed a vit c essence from my dermatologist who told me it would go after my toner/essence. There are days I question it too but she‚Äôs the derm so *shug*. Thanks for that rec! I‚Äôve heard great things about Missha but have only tried their mugwort essence. I will def check this out. I‚Äôm also very curious. I‚Äôve had my eye on their different ‚Äúpro strength‚Äù items Ooh thank you! Those are super cute too! Hi, can you please share how you clean the bottles before you put the essences in there? I'm interested in decanting my own essences but am not sure how to sanitize the bottles beforehand. What does it mean when you say your pores feel congested? Or what does it look like? I‚Äôm still new to a good skincare routine lol Since you mentioned a facialist, I was wondering how often you get a facial and what kind, and if you see a dermatologist for procedures as well? And does your facialist hook you up with Skinceuticals enough so that you never have to buy it on your own? If so thats a really good deal! Does the Skinceuticals C E Ferulic smell bad?  I‚Äôve been wanting to incorporate a vitamin C into my routine but I find myself buying them and not using them because I can‚Äôt stand my face smelling like old sausages. I get samples from the girls that work at my derm, and am VERY grateful lol, 3 or 4 last me a long time. That said, after years of CE ferulic from Skinceuticals, Maelove‚Äôs version is nearly identical with added moisturizers(a proprietary blend), the PH, everything the same. They got out of being sued by adding the ‚Äúproprietary blend‚Äù. Worth checking out at $30. :) Thanks! How often do you find yourself running out and having to replace it? Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I feel more confident, self cared for, happier, more feminine. It‚Äôs more than just facial cleansing/moisturizing for me. üòä That's really interesting...I've been taught by several aesthies to never swipe or rub P50 on, but to pat it in. I also used Shiseido cottons or the similar ones from Muji, but now I just use my fingers. Thanks for the detailed response! I've been using the Indie Lee CoQ-10 spray and I love it so much. I think one of the reasons is because it's in the spray format. Need to look into that for my SKII. Ah my friend and I have been dying to go to a BR spa but the closest one is like an hour and a half away. And yes I agree with you, I feel like when I use the cotton it is helping to remove stuff from my face. Great to hear, thanks again! It looks so pretty tbh but i dont think i have enough reasons to splurge on it. I keep my vit C eye cream in the fridge. Feels nice on the ole peepers They sure do go above and beyond with packaging.  It might take more time but it makes it an experience! I need more rice powder so I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhmmmm maybe I should get the bowl too‚Äù. That may be true, granted wanting to use products that are strictly intended as a solution to some physical blemish or ailment as a hobby, it‚Äôs like if I took the steroid cream I use for my psioriasis and applied it for fun or cause it made me ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù outside of its intended benefit, skincare is meant to be a form of self treating OTC medication to treat certain skin problems, overusing it can lead to health detriments, just like over use of anything else, wagyu beef is something someone spends on once a month MAYBE at most, same with expensive wine, and those are indulgences that aren‚Äôt had every day, or else you‚Äôd be an alcoholic or have high cholesterol, and they don‚Äôt pretend to treat any kind of ailment, this subreddit, the reason I‚Äôm on it, is to educate myself on what‚Äôs good and bad for my skin, whether it be through addition or hopefully more often subtraction, not to glorify consumerism in the form of fancy OTC medication, which is unfortunately what this subreddit is sort of becoming with these ‚Äúshelfies‚Äù and designer highly sought after brands like tatcha, even if they are effective, they become an object of desire rather than ‚Äúwill this work for my skin‚Äù and the train of thought becomes ‚Äúcan I add another thing to feed my skincare addiction to correct this insignificant problem or still use it and see no change?‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt that seem like a shit ton of stuff to be rubbing on your face in a daily basis? Your skin has a natural balance of bacteria and oils, and a lot of it can just be very chemically abrasive and all that skincare could seriously disrupt that, I‚Äôm all for a good routine, but a lot of routines I see are just excessive and I always wonder how people arrive at needing this much, it‚Äôll make your skin look great short term but long term it‚Äôs not sustainable [removed] Same Provide some sort of manual exfoliation. It‚Äôs pretty gentle and didn‚Äôt do much tbh Do you have a link by chance? Your skin needs to be a certain PH for the vitamin C to work well as it‚Äôs very unstable. It‚Äôs best to apply skinceuticals immediately after using a gentle cleanser so that it will react well with your skin & will actually work. What‚Äôs the dupe that you use if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? This is interesting! I think I started doing it as a buffer because other vitamin C‚Äôs have been so irritating for me. Like made my face super itchy! But after trying it later in my routine, I didn‚Äôt feel any of that and I still noticed a difference! The Pro Strength line is a game changer. This is the strongest Niacinamide that I have ever used and it works wonders to lighten dark spots for me‚Äîmostly old acne scars. Have you guys ever tried the Ordinary‚Äôs? This is 100x better in my opinion. And I think it‚Äôs fast acting too! This is actually my second bottle for this year. Downside is price but the first one lasted me from February until July. Wash them with soap, let dry over night. Then spray some alcohol in and let that completely dry before putting the product in the bottle. After I started using AHA I realized that open, fresh skin can actually have a breathing sensation. I notice a very nice, pleasant, sort of absorbing sensation when I apply products (especially amino acids-feels so good) and an open, airy sensation. I don't know how to describe it but I notice most the day after AHA application. Usually, little bumps and texture! I go once a quarter and I usually just get their basic facial but my facialist also adds on dermabrasion for free. And yes, she gave me 10 last time lol so I think that‚Äôll definitely last me a long time! Yes, it smells like hotdog water. But I don‚Äôt notice it once it‚Äôs on my skin! I use the Mad Hippie Vitamin C. I think it's effective and it doesn't smell bad. The Timeless vitamin C doesn't smell like anything to me! If there was a lawsuit and it was that close then I‚Äôm there! Thanks for the rec! I use Maelove when I‚Äôm too broke for SkinCeuticals. I think the $90 jar lasts me 3 months. So prob around $30 a month for the La Mer if I use it religiously. Normally, that‚Äôs only during the winter months. Have you ever noticed how gross the cotton pad is sometimes after using P50? I think that‚Äôs a benefit of using the pad for me! Haha >never swipe or rub P50 on, but to pat it in

Okay so I tried this last night and I like it!! I soaked my cotton pad and then pressed it into my skin and I feel like my skin responded better! Thanks for mentioning this Yeah, totally not a necessity! I‚Äôm sure there are other sets out there that you can substitute for way less. This is def a splurge. The bowl is made of thin wood and covered in a resin outer layer. The brush is made by an ancient Japanese brush maker and the bristles have been trimmed with a razor. I think the loop that you use to hang the brush is gold-plated. 

The bristles feel amazing on the skin. It‚Äôs different than anything I‚Äôve used before. It does a great job at cleansing. I totally fail to understand your logic here. So it‚Äôs okay to indulge in a $150 steak or bottle of wine once a month, but it‚Äôs not okay to spend that much on a serum that will last you 6 months. You‚Äôre spewing total nonsense here. People have different indulgences and that‚Äôs okay. Skincare can absolutely be a hobby, you're kinda gatekeeping here. Doesn't matter the reason why *you* do skincare, or how you think it should be done. 

I agree the sub can get obsessive but this overly condescending and judgy series of comments is not the way to contribute. Says who? You? She‚Äôs not using every item every day though. Plenty people have 5-8 step routines. Just saying [removed] [deleted] I never liked it for my face, but I did absolutely love it mixed into my body wash in the shower. 
But I could never justify the cost for something I ended up using such a large quantity of in the shower. Ah ok. Thanks! Looks like it could be this one: [link](https://www.amazon.com/Copco-2555-0189-Non-Skid-Kitchen-Organizer/dp/B0036OQU4C/ref=zg_bs_510156_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B88VKTNCQ07ZM1284KKS) But you can put on toner first? Or better to wait until after? It‚Äôs not an exact dupe but the C15 booster from Paula‚Äôs Choice Drunk Elephant C-Firma is the closest dupe you can find, it's amazing BTW, SkinCeuticals took Drunk Elephant to court over that Vitamin C serum. I mix mine with B-Hydra and my face drinks it up! I use Timeless Vit C! It's meant to be the best cheap dupe (I got it for $36/4 oz) but it honestly doesn't work too well for me. I use Drunk Elephant's C-Firma (dupe for SkinCeuticals, Drunk Elephant was taken to court over the vitamin C serum being a copy of theirs, fyi) mixed in with B-Hydra then slather Lala Retro over that. Maybe you could mix in something with it to make it less irritating, but still first in your skin care steps. Just a suggestion! You've convinced me! The Ordinary one did very little for me but I have good results from K beauty niacinamide serums. I'll get this one next, thanks! I've only been using it a couple months but it's miles better than the ordinary! A bit pricey but my skin is so much more even, and my stubborn hyper pigmentation is starting to fade. Thanks! What type of soap do you use? I've used dish soap or hand soap, then washed again with a face soap I don't like, for some jars before. Is this okay? Is it inappropriate to ask you to recommend me your facialist (': My cat is always like WHAT IS ON YOUR FACE lol Do you notice any difference? I hate to say it, bc ive didn‚Äôt do much money on skinceuticals, but I really think maelove is just as good, if not better. I used to double cleanse using the rice polish as a second cleanse but I have to admit when I switched to a gel second cleanse, I had little to no residue on the cotton pad, so I stopped using them. You‚Äôre welcome, I‚Äôm glad to hear it :) Again, this particular ‚Äúindulgence‚Äù is meant to be medication, not a spa day, you take care of your problem with it then done, and you don‚Äôt add on useless products on top of that, hoping it‚Äôll make you pretty enough to feel confident, skincare works to a point, but seriously, enough is enough, skincare is a functional thing that the cosmetics industry capitalized on because they realized they could get people to buy overpriced useless junk in excess, the difference is wine and steak are purely indulgences that are enjoyed occasionally, skincare is something that‚Äôs meant to be functional that people have really perverted into a fun ‚Äúhobby‚Äù and all that does is promote wasteful spending and bad health habits because too much skincare is in fact BAD for you, no matter how clear your skin looks I think there‚Äôs a line between judgey and critical, just because criticism doesn‚Äôt sound nice doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs overly judgmental, but why are you defending the habit of buying a metric shit ton of skin care and making it ok by calling it a hobby? What does your routine look like? Mine is just cleansing, moisturizing, and sunscreen on appropriate days once daily, I used to have the same ideas of ‚Äúskincare is fun! I‚Äôm doing this for my health!‚Äù But I kinda realized overtime it was useless and honestly made my skin worse, a drain on my bank account, and was really just me defending consumeristic habits, so I just don‚Äôt know what you, or anyone else who I‚Äôve been downvoted by, is defending other than a bad habit Well yes me, but there‚Äôs a lot of new research coming out on the skin microbiome and how skincare, especially a lot of it, horribly disrupts it, and it‚Äôs actually part of the reason I‚Äôll see acne in the developed world but hardly ever in more tribal populations of human like certain tribes of Africans, and besides, let me ask the opposite question, who says that much skincare is GOOD for you? Did a dermatologist recommend all those brands? And where‚Äôs the research that say that much skincare isn‚Äôt harmful? I have a hard time believing any human needs THAT many products just to have a clear face, you weren‚Äôt born with terrible skin that was lacking in each of those specific things you purchased off a shelf, it‚Äôs more like you‚Äôve adapted yourself to needing each one of those things and you‚Äôve formed a growing dependence on them just for your skin to look average, and without them your skin would look terrible for a while but then probably revert back to being normal, with or without a very minimal amount of skincare Yeah I get that, but fuck it‚Äôs still so much
And even 5-8 step routines seem excessive, me personally I get congested pores and zits way worse when I try and add products (and after I have passed the purging period) and found a simple cleanse and moisturize with sunscreen when appropriate is the best (again for me personally), like it‚Äôs an outrageous amount of money to correct what are often tiny problems, again, I appreciate a healthy and simpler than anything routine, but we aren‚Äôt chemists or dermatologists, and most people just go with trial and error, that many different chemicals and substances on just your face is a wild guess at what it will do to you long term, or if it even is what really works or if something much simpler will work [removed] Yup, I‚Äôm on this subreddit cause I wanted to become more informed on some surface level dermatology and brands that actually work at a good price, also how to strip away elements of my routine to make it simpler and less toxic, and some people here definitely do do that and are great, but posts like this are glorified consumerism hiding behind a veil of science and dermatology The idea is that vit c needs to be at a pH of <4 in order to work. Toners/essences are usually at pH5.5-6. So vit c should in theory go first. Thanks for the reply! I‚Äôve never tried anything from PC and have always been curious‚Äîperhaps I will give this a try. Now that‚Äôs some interesting info. V-persuasive Thank you for this thoughtful reply! I‚Äôve actually tried c-firma and my skin hated it for some reason, but I also wasn‚Äôt very educated in the use of vitamin c when I had been using it. I actually enjoyed b-hydra and think it would definitely work well in conjunction because c-firma made my skin feel very taught. I‚Äôll have to try the sample DE kit and see how my skin handles it this time. Thanks again! Well you have to be really careful with cocktails. Most experts condemn drunk elephant (and now the ordinary) for encouraging consumers to mix things together like that. Your hands aren‚Äôt an industrial mixer and it‚Äôs almost impossible for you to actually distribute the product evenly. So what might happen is you have a concentration of vit C on one area of your face and none on the other, which leads to patchy application and irritation on random parts of your face. So mixing actives with other products isn‚Äôt usually recommended, even if it‚Äôs worked for you so far. I‚Äôve heard good things about Timeless but I‚Äôve never looked into them for a vitamin c serum. I honestly can see how it‚Äôs difficult to find a good dupe because vitamin c is such a finicky ingredient. I feel like I never use it correctly. Any soap would work even shampoo. I just use dawn dish soap with warm water. Rinse them thoroughly until I can‚Äôt smell the soap and let them dry. Never had a problem. SkinCeuticals formula has a longer shelf life- vitamin C is usually very unstable. I can buy SkinCeuticals and make it last for 6 months and I will still get the same results from the first day I buy it. Maelove will start going bad much sooner. 

But in terms of skin results, they‚Äôre almost identical. I would recommend Maelove if SkinCeuticals is too expensive. Those who want to try SkinCeuticals, Dermstore.com has 15% off sales on SkinCeuticals products in February, April, June and September. Sign up for their newsletter. And why the hell can‚Äôt it be a spa day? You‚Äôre gatekeeping how people choose to enjoy their lives. Not everyone uses skincare for medical purposes, nor does everything in life have to be functional. Sometimes people just want to do a nice thing for themselves after a stressful day. You're really marching against the grain here in a sub called skincare *addiction* hah. Though your sentiments I do very much agree with in that there's a line between functional and excess, plus plenty of products are glorified, grossly overpriced moisturizers, sometimes *at best*. 
Still, how can YOU personally really tell if someone's overdoing anything? And which products are or aren't worth their price? You've probably neither used that many, if any, of OPs products, *nor* do you have their skin to evaluate by. It doesn't matter what my routine is, or if I "approve" of someone else's business. It doesn't matter where *you* draw the line between functional and useless, or when skincare becomes a  "bad habit" . 

Your comments are all focused on how everyone else is wrong because they don't ascribe to the same ideas as you - *that's* judgey, *that's* non-constructive criticism. 

Glad you found a routine / skincare philosophy that works for you - that's the essence of YMMV, it's different for everyone. 

Not interested in arguing further, I don't think this is a productive conversation. [removed] Also that La mer cream. My god. You can get a better moisturiser for a fraction of the price of that. People literally buy this stuff because it's pricey and they think that equals better. Some of the folks on this sub reddit need to watch Hyram's videos on YouTube!! Actually, you can put on Toner first. From the Skinceuticals website:

"In the morning after **cleansing and toning,** apply 4-5 drops to a dry face, neck, and chest before other anti-aging skincare products. "

I said "bare skin" initially because I don't tone, and OP uses a serum before it (not a toner). The CE + Ferulic should go after toner (if you use toner) but **before** any serums.

ETA: I went on Skinceuticals chat feature (they connect you with a live aesthetician immediately--it's awesome) and the aesthetician confirmed that you apply toner first. I specifically asked about P50V, but she said it applies for all toners. However, any serum should come afterwards. But how do you even get your skin pH at <4 when you put on Vitamin C? I'm washing off my cleanser with water (pH 7) and putting vitamin C on my skin (pH 5) I started out trying to use C-Firma by itself, as well, and I would end up using 3 pumps to cover my entire face, it didn't go well as you can imagine. I read on their website about making "cocktails" for your face. One pump C-Firma, one pump B-Hydra, one pump Lala Retro and apply. That was way too much applied at once, so I finally found the best way for my skin to absorb the Vitamin C without feeling like all the moisture was sucked out of my body and my skin actually loved it! Also, check out Poshmark or Mercari, especially this time of year, everyone sells their Drunk Elephant stuff that comes in kits that they don't like or use, and you can get bottles for less than half of retail. Very good information to know! Thank you! I'll try to start layering instead. The vitamin C seems to not go as far if it isn't mixed with the vitamin B. I may try to layer B, then C, then moisturize. Thats good, thanks again! **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

No, I think we overestimate how much we really need as humans, cause humans evolved without skincare, we‚Äôre pretty ok Pretty sure he‚Äôs a dude and this is a classic example of mansplaining. You‚Äôre confusing being judge mental with having an opinion like everyone else, obviously you‚Äôre going to criticize someone when you think they‚Äôre doing something wrong and potentially unhealthy, you could argue you‚Äôre doing the same thing with me and being equally ‚Äújudgey‚Äù of me criticizing people because I‚Äôm concerned of the direction this subreddit takes people 
Comments are open on a post to post your thoughts, good or bad as long as they‚Äôre not hateful or downright mean, not just the positive ‚Äúomg I love your shelfie!‚Äù I was never mean or anything like that, again all I‚Äôve been saying is TOO MUCH CAN BE TOO MUCH, seriously if you think that‚Äôs being so judgey then grow a spine and don‚Äôt take shit personally, I‚Äôm allowed to put my two cents into something I see a problem with without getting called judgey and a ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù over and over again [removed] I actually watch Hyram and understand his point of view as well as everyone else‚Äôs here. I think all of your opinions are valid and it‚Äôs good to have a discussion. 

The La Mer is always going to be controversial because of its price point. I like it but it‚Äôs totally not a necessity. I bought it more to try and see for myself. I know I‚Äôm lucky to be able to do that. 

I see skincare as my hobby and I really enjoy it. I use products that benefit my skin through trial and error‚Äîand I find it a lot of fun! I try to stay informed by watching labmuffin or Dr. Dray. I read about ingredients and check all of my product labels. I also have a dermatologist and a facialist who I discuss my routines with every few months. Lately, my skin‚Äôs been the best it‚Äôs been all of my life. 

I posted this photo because I was proud‚ÄîI just moved into a new place and wanted to have my bathroom be like a mini spa, my own little sanctuary from my crazy stressful life. So I set up a little spa station‚Äîthis subreddit actually gave me this idea‚Äîand it‚Äôs made me really happy. No mission to promote consumerism here. üôÇ Hyram isn‚Äôt a dermatologist, aesthetician, chemist or anything that even works in the field lmao. He‚Äôs someone who enjoys skincare and posts *his* beliefs about it on youtube...just like OP is doing. which is totally fine. i don‚Äôt agree with Hyram sometimes and he‚Äôs certainly not who i‚Äôd ever turn to for actual skincare advice so idk why you‚Äôre advocating for him but yet shaming OP lol I do love Hyram, my only issue with a lot of skincare YouTubers is overexposure of products, they‚Äôll rave about certain products that you don‚Äôt have and a the benefits and it gives viewers the ‚Äúfear of missing out‚Äù when their skincare routine is working perfectly fine as is, but instead they feel compelled to change something or add something unnecessary It might be worth noting that skinceuticals only sells exfoliating toners. The pH of water varies depending on where you live and most cleansers have a pH of around 5-6. Skinceuticals CE ferulic is pH 2.5-3. If you're using a vitamin c with ascorbic acid, the product needs to have a ph of less than 4 to be effective. No problem! Layering is right way to go. I would suggest you the the vit c before B though so the pH of B doesn‚Äôt negatively affect C. Good bot Honestly I can see that fitting here, super self-righteous. Bless the block button! [removed] You don't need to defend your choices, how you spend your money, or how you enjoy your hobby. Glad you found products / a routine that works for you :) [deleted] It took many dermatologist appointments, a lot of trial and error products, until I found this subreddit and finally found the products and routine that have made my skin and soul so happy! 

Skintype: Combination, hyperpigmentation, hormonal breakouts 

AM Routine:

CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser: does not dry out my skin like most facial cleansers. Leaves my skin hydrated and soft.¬†

TO's Niacinamide 10% and Zinc 1%: HG! I use it every morning after washing my face and it definitely helps me not break out.¬†

Laneige Emulsion: I use this as my moisturizer, it is super hydrating and light. It doesn't feel heavy and is perfect to mix with oils.

Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment: I use this as a sunscreen and it helps with redness.¬†

PM Routine:

up&up Micellar Cleansing Water: I've used different brands, and they all work just the same for me to remove makeup.

CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser

TO's Azalaic Acid:¬†I LOVE the consistency of this. It almost feels like a primer, makes my face feel moisturized and soft, and for an acid that's kind of a rarity.¬†

TO's Glycolic Acid: I switch from Axalaic Acis to this every other night, however I haven't really felt or seen any drastic¬†changes with this one, so I may discontinue it.¬†

TO's 100% Rose Hip Seed Oil: HG! I've only been using this one for a few weeks, but I almost immediately felt the difference with this. My face feels super soft with this! I like to mix it with¬†Laneige Emulsion¬†lotion. Love that Cicapair line from Dr. Jart. A total miracle product for me! Does anyone else have any issues with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser not cleaning your face well? Am  I missing something?  I have the same skin type! I'd love to see a before and after photo!  I have the Cicapair cream as well - I LOVE it! I hardly wear makeup anymore, only this, as it evens me out and gives me SPF. My new fav product üòç Which product(s) do you use for hyperpigmentation? Just ordered the Azelaic Acid and Niacinamide/Zinc!  Thanks for your post didn‚Äôt realize how cheap these products were also. Any recommendations here for how to fix redness in the face? I want an even skin tone. I saw OP posted that one of their products helped with redness  I use 3 of those products and love them! Wow your skin description and routine are both very similar to mine! The combo of TO glycolic toner, niacinamide, and azeliac acid has so changed my skin. Maybe incorporate some vitamin C on nights where you aren‚Äôt using the acids or niacinamide! It‚Äôs worked wonders for my hyperpigmentation, i just use the TO one with HA spheres.  Is there anything out there like the Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment without its grapefruit peel oil, lavender oil, and rosewood oil? My skin is extremely sensitive, easily shows red because I'm a ginger and pasty white, and I'm on Accutane for another month or so. I don't use products that have fragrances or sensitizing ingredients like grapefruit peel oil or lavender as a policy, but this product seems so cool and perfect for me besides those ingredient  :(  Do you mix your TO niacinamide or apply it as is onto your face? What does the azalaic do? How has the azaliac acid changed your skin? I‚Äôm really interested in this stuff  [deleted] Nice little collection you have there. Also btw happy cake day! i love the ordinary foundation. this post makes me want to try more or their products !!!! thank you :) I use the same TO Niacinamide, Azalaic Acid, and Rosehip Seed Oil! Your routine is super similar to mine.

Couple questions:

Have you considered adding Vit C to your routine?

And if you cut the TO Glycolic Acid, will you use the Azalaic Acid every single night or continue to use it every other night? Congratulations on conquering your skin! Thanks for sharing! Just ordered TO's niacinamide, rosehip seed oil, hyaluronic acid, and azelaic acid. Just have to do a bit more reading to make sure I incorporate them properly into routine. Any tips from anyone would definitely be appreciated. Love it, but just a recommendation, you should really use spf I‚Äôm the morning! Especially with all those actives.
Edit: I‚Äôm silly didn‚Äôt realize the color corrector had spf ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Do you find that using the Laneige prevents the Cicapair cream from clinging to dry patches? I tried using it on its own as a moisturizer and I found that it clinged to any dry patch.  I use the same TO products! Happy for you :) Goals!!!! Congrats!!!! I see so many of my HG products here! I also left the house without foundation this weekend üòä congratulations!!! [deleted] Wow thats awesome! I think really need to try some How long after I apply the acids are you suppose to wait before applying the moisturizer? I have almost an identical routine but have always wondered if I‚Äôm doing it right.  Dream shelf!!! Is the azelic acid for chemical exfoliation? Right now I am using Pixi glycolic but I‚Äôm interested in learning about different ones! Thanks! Interested in your thoughts on The Ordinary 7% Glycolic Acid toner. Just picked it up recently to try and reverse some hyperpigmentation and shrink some pores. What are your thoughts on it's efficacy?  What do you suggest for hyperpigmentation correction? I've stopped my chest breakouts but I have the residual marks that may as well be active they're so annoying. Help? Okay I love the idea of the nozzle top on your TO Glycolic! I‚Äôm going to change out my bottle‚Äôs cap  Do you suffer from oily acne prone skin? If so i might try these products too As someone new here who only uses the cerave moisturizing cream what should I add next in my routine? I was dumb when I was in high school and didn't wear much sunscreen and am trying to do the best I can now. I need to adopt a face care regimen so bad. My face isn‚Äôt bad but it could be clearer.  I love laniege. I feel like not enough people talk about them-maybe because they are semi expensive, but every time I run out and go without for awhile my skin misses it.  Have you tried Cerave's foam cleanser? The one for normal to oily? Everyone seems to use the hydrating one but I'm a combination to oily person, I haven't seen anyone review it yet here. [deleted] I use some of those products in my routine and looking to add a few more TO products. What order do you use those products? Amazing! So happy for you! Does the tiger cream have long term effects or does your skins redness come back once you wash it off?  Omg I literally just ordered rose hip oil from Sephora. It will be my first time using the brand and product. Ive read positive reviews about the oil .  [removed] Happy to hear about that, i personally use lucent skin anti aging because of my wrinkles and it worked pretty well for my skin type, most products does'nt worked for me in the past but now i have complete range of daily skin care, you can learn more https://www.healthplusbeauty.tk/ This looks mad expensive Does the TO Azelaic Acid cause visible peeling?  Where dyou get your cicapair tiger grass color corrector???? Sephora doesnt sell it anymore! [deleted] So far the azaleic acid! Although I hear vit c helps a lot for that, I just need to find myself a new one because the one I had been using was too oily for me.  The rosehip oil is so good and so cheap! I almost cried when I ran out of a Belif one I got in SK that they don't sell in the West and this is just as good.  Any tips for using the TO azelaic acid? Just bought some for the first time today and going to try it tonight!  Never used azelaic acid before.

EDIT: Should it be used before or after moisturizer? I haven‚Äôt heard of using the Tiger Grass as a sunscreen but that‚Äôs a great idea. It goes on so well. Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream is my go-to moisturizer but it doesn‚Äôt have SPF and I‚Äôve been looking for an SPF that doesn‚Äôt mess with the really nice finish the Ceramidin cream leaves on my face.  How long did it take you to notice visible differences? I have the same issues as you and I started using TO products a couple weeks ago. My face feels softer but I don‚Äôt see visible improvements yet. Definitely too early to notice any but maybe your input can give me an idea.  Is this the order you use the products as well? If so, why use the Azalaic Acid before the Glycolic acid and the Rose Hip Seed Oil?  Hey OP, what specifically helped you with hyperpigmentation? I have this and have been using TO's lactic acid but I haven't noticed any changes since I started using it in July.  What‚Äôs the azalaic acid good for? About to place an order with TO so just wanna grab some recc stuff that I‚Äôve been reading about Do you have more input on your experiences with and/or info about it? Aw dang. I've never seen that glycolic acid suspension from them and I had high hopes after eyeing it in the picture.

Glycolic acid has always done so well with my skin, I was hoping it was working for you! I also have combo skin and hormonal outbreaks. (brb getting rose hip oil) This is almost my exact routine, minus the Rose Hip Oil and the Laneige. Will add!!!  Thanks for this great write up. I‚Äôm really interested in trying the azalaic acid and rise hip seed oil!
 I see the difference with glycolic acid. Maybe give it some time or get higher % . So do you apply the azaliac acid, wait for it to sink in then apply rose-hip and ur Mouturiser?  What does the Rose hip oil do? Also, since you mentioned azelaic acid helps a lot with discoloration...can you go into more detail with this?

Are you a person of color, or do you have rosacea? 

And what other stuff have you tried for hyperpigmentation? Was your dermatologist willing to write you a prescription for any skin care? And if so what was it 4 + was it reasonable? Where‚Äôs the sunscreen? I am convinced that this product single-handedly cleared my skin up. I am in love. Ahh I‚Äôve been really curious about it! I currently use the ceramidin liquid and cream (old formula) but I‚Äôm almost out. No, I agree. I use a cleansing balm first, then I use the Cerave Hydrating Cleanser. Feels much more effective as a second cleanser  Same! It feels very subtle which is why I use the micellar water first to remove makeup. It makes me break out like crazy and feels kind of slimy on my skin.  I sometimes love this cleanser, but other times it stings the living shit out of my eyelids, or other places where I have dryness or eczema flares.... anyone able to relate/provide insight about this??  [deleted] I agree, I use it in the mornings when I feel I don't need a stronger cleanser You're not alone, I don't care for it either I double-cleanse with an oil cleanser first, and never have any makeup left over. Maybe that would help?  You could try using a cleansing oil before cleanser. I hear hada labo makes an excellent one, and it's affordable. I personally haven't used it though. Edit: So for some reason I thought I had tried *Cerave Hydrating Cleanser* but in reality it was *Neutrogena Ultra Hydrating Cleanser* that I tried, so I gusss this whole comment is unrelated lol. Well whatever. I'll leave it anyways and maybe someone will know what I'm rambling about.


I feel like it doesn't actually *clean* my face but leaves a slight waxy feeling‚Äîsimilar to bar soap‚Äîthat when dragging a finger across the face in the shower the finger will skip slightly across the skin because of the waxy feel.

I also notice the already prominent sebaceous filaments on my nose to look worse, little tiny blackheads on my forehead, and blackheads on my chin which make some big whiteheads if I don't carefully unclog them manually with tools‚Äîwhich only works about half the time. I never took before pics because I was so self conscious! But I'll take one now and update it later!! I definitely still have some hyperpigmentation so it'll be nice to see improvements!  Is it basically used as moisturizer with spf? This may sound silly, but how do you apply yours? I got it recently and I somehow made myself look streaky! From what I can see:


Glycolic acid


Azelaic acid


Possibly niacinide I'm guessing the azelaic acid did most of the work. that's my experience.  I discovered it on this sub! So happy they're so affordable! How long before you saw results? Ohhhh I'm glad it's worked for you!! I had one of TOs VitC but it was too oily for me..but I wanted to try the one with the ha spheres, so if it worked for you it's possible it might for me as well. Will be giving it a go! Do you use it after the azelaic acid? And how is it's consistency?  try Avene cicalfate! It's really soothing and good for sensitive skin I don‚Äôt have a suggestion but I just wanted to say I wouldn‚Äôt  suggest the tiger grass CC treatment if you‚Äôre super pale. It‚Äôs one of my HG products but it‚Äôs just a smidge too dark on my skin (NW13 for reference)  if there was a similar product without the EOs and a little lighter that would be amazing  Just as is :) I usually wait a minute before applying the next product. It does feel a bit tad sticky after but it usually goes away after applying my mositurizer.   Brightens skin and diminishes acne and redness Not OP, but I have super sensitive skin, and it shrinks any active pimple I have without drying my skin out. And prevents breakouts. 

My only complaint is that you have to wait a few minutes before applying your next product  Same!! It helped me get a little confidence to go out without foundation.  Thank you! :) Ohh!! I have yet to try their foundation. Do you find it has good coverage?  Do you mind sharing your routine how you use the 3 things you mentioned? Thank you! üíó Use the oil at the end! Preferably at night. The website has a lot of details on how to use them correctly! Hehe no problem! I'm sure it may be helping someone else reading these to make sure they are using spf! I gathered all my info from comments like these! :)  I usually wait a couple of minutes before I apply the cicapair cream, this usually let's my skin "soak up" the Laneige, but I haven't had that experience. I do feel like the cicapair takes some time to settle in, but that feeling usually goes away by the time I leave the house. If u had to choose between both though, I would definitely choose Laneige since it makes my skin feel so hydrated without feeling heavy like the cicapair does. Thank you!!! :) Congrats to you too!! Such a freeing feeling!  That's what I've begun to do now! I even use a makeup brush to put it on üòÇ I don't think there's a set time, I just wait until I feel that the product has settled..almost like it's dry enough that if I put on the moisturizer it's not getting mixed as I apply it. For me it takes about 1mim for the azaleic acid and about 40 seconds for the glycolic acid. It really depends on your skin.  Yes it is! I switch back and forth every night between the two (the glycolic acid I have from TO is supposed to be a pixi doup as you probably know). I didn't see drastic changes with the glycolic acid and it does sting a little. However, I like the azaleic one more so I may just use that one primarily once I run out of the glycolic acid.  The ordinary's price tag is worth it if you're looking for something new.  (Plus free shipping at $25)

I have stupid-sensitive skin (combination/acne prone) and it's made the biggest difference in my skin care routine. It does brighten up a little, but nothing too drastic. As for shrinking pores it did not work for that..at least for me. The azaleic acid for sure! Just gotta stick to it for at least 3 months. Also, vitamin c! I've heard it's great for it I just have to switch the one I was previously using because it was too oily for me.  That's how it came! Lol Yes! Mostly hormonal acne, but combo. My cheek area is my oily zone Vitamin C! And definitely sunscreen, specially if you use the VitC. Other than that it really depends on your skin type It doesn't even have to be long and complicated. If you at least make sure it's hydrated usually that alone improves some problem areas. :) Yes! It's the best for keeping my skin hydrated! I used only Laneige for one entire year a couple years ago and I feel like it brought my face to a clearer canvas in order to start incorporating all these other actives.  Is there any specific products of laneige you recommend? (I have a lot of toners and emulsifiers so maybe anything but those) I haven't! I was on the fence between the two and chose this one since it was the one well reviewed lol I might give it a ago after this one runs out and I'll come back to this post and update! üòÅ I have and it did nothing for my breakouts Hi! I do have some before so but they're like yeeeeee old. I was so self conscious I didn't take any recent before ones without makeup üò£ I will now..it won't be as noticable maybe but I plan on doing it again in a year to see if there's any improvements The way they are pictured! And written in my comment if you look in the thread ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è It does calm my redness even after removing it, but since it has a green tint to it, its even less noticable when it's on.  Yay! Hope you like it! I wake up with super soft skin from it ‚ò∫Ô∏è Hi there,

For more information, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_4._no_blog_or_company_spam).  Most of these are under $10 each! :)  Nah, TO and CeraVe are dirt cheap Its  very gentle with a big pay off in my opinion. Doesn't feel like an acid on your skin or react that way. My husband, 3 sisters, and best friend also now use it and they haven't ever had issues with peeling. And we range from oily to dry as a bone It hasn't for me :) I use the same stuff, and my skin is so sensitive, I only ever noticed slight pealing on my nose, and so slight my primer/foundation covers it.   I got it at Sephora. Oh no! Now I have to start searching too! Ah yes! Thanks! üòÖ I can recommend Timeless. It doesn't grease  I've found Silk Naturals products to have a nice consistency - I've been using the facelift serum.  Yes! I'm so so happy with it! I also love that it doesn't feel extremely oily, as it has with other oils I've tried from TO. What is the rosehip oil for?  I got a bottle as a gift and haven't used it too much I use it before kinda like an acid. So I use it than will let it sink in for 15 minutes than use a moisturizer .  In my short time with it, I‚Äôve had trouble spreading it around my face without using a ton of product. (it sets kind of quickly and mattes down a bit). I‚Äôve since incorporated the Hada Labo Premium Lotion as a hydrating toner, which I use after cleansing and before the TO Azelaic Suspension. It makes it much easier to spread around and I don‚Äôt have to use as much product! Moisturizer should come after this and any other treatments, and before sunscreen.  I use it before so the active ingredient can really reach the skin..the moisturizer might work as a barrier and therefore may not be as effective.  I hate most sunscreens so I usually try to get my soft from creams like these or in my foundation. :)  I use very similar to OP (everything except Cicapair and Laneige, and I might try the Cicapair). The rosehip oil difference I noticed pretty quickly (but you have to leave it on overnight in my case, in the evening it looks like an oily mess but in the morning my skin looks and feels amazing), but the rest took a few months to really make a noticeable difference.

But it did make a pretty damn good difference in the end, especially the hyper-pigmentation I have is a lot better and my skin tone is smoother, and I very rarely get acne that usually clears up quickly. I would say about 6 months at least, but I mean everyone's skin is different so it could be a shorter or longer time for you to notice it.  I don't use the acids together, I take turns one night with one the next with the other. I use the oil at the end since it's a heavier product and the acids won't be as effective if you use it after an oil...occlusives (ie. Oils) should be last.  And yes! In that order :) The azelaic acid has helped me the most. I did want to try lactic acid next if I don't see any more improvements. Some products just work better on some than others. Maybe you can incorporate it and use both? Like one day one the other day the other one?  Helping with redness + even clearing up acne. It‚Äôs more gentle bc it‚Äôs already found in the skin. 

If you have time Dr Dray has a [great video ](https://youtu.be/ARIK9RdXPJ0) explaining it, she emphasizes that it takes a while to really work (3 + months). Just mentioning bc I notice a lot of people seem to quit it after a few weeks or before it has time to work.  Hope it works well for you! :) Yeah I'll definitely not stop until the bottle runs out. Do you know any brands with higher %?  Yup! I mix the oil with the mositurizer so it can be spread more.easily and evenly.  Evens skin tones/brightens and helps with spots, like sun spots or aging spots and moisturizes.  I've also read from other people's comments that it's helped them with acne. I just love how hydrated and soft it makes my skin feel.  No rosacea, I have Hispanic brown skin color, if that helps. I've also tried VitC, but not long enough to cause much difference, I do plan on finding a new one as the one I was previously using was too oily for me.  I had cystic acne during my teenage years, they went as far as prescribing accutane...with blood draws and birth control and all the purging I became super depressed so I stopped taking it. I probably could have gotten rid of it if I continued and I probably should have, but I just couldn't at the time. It could be that I'm older now with more balanced hormones, but  after finding this subreddit and finding products that worked for my skin, I'm finally finding the light at the end of the tunnel!  OP uses Dr. Jart Cicapair color correcting treatment, which is SPF 30. Huge Dr Jart+ fan here, and I use the Ceramidin Cream and Tiger Grass Color Corrector during the day instead of foundation, and the Cicapair Tiger Grass Re.Pair Serum and Nightly Mask in the evening. It helps A TON with my redness and angry skin (I‚Äôm pretty fair and susceptible to hormonal acne and flush cheeks). I‚Äôd say adding the Tiger Grass (Cicapair) products to my regimen has 100% improved my skin. I would highly recommend nabbing some samples from your local Sephora if you can.  If you can get a sample from your local sephora I'd try Cicapair for sure. Clears up my pimples in days What type of cleansing balm do you recommend? Do you use it on wet skin and wash it off with a wet washcloth? I read a theory somewhere that said it stings where your moisture barrier is weak because of the fatty acids. Not sure how accurate that is, but I get the same stinging sensation when I don't take great care of my skin and then use the cleanser.  I agree completely. My skin doesn't feel dry and tight so I love that.  I was thinking of trying a different one, but its just so soothing to my skin. I don‚Äôt actually wear a lot of makeup, but when I do I use the Purity cleanser by Philosophy followed by Cerave Foaming Cleanser. Another good oil based cleanser is the Cleansing oil by Dermalogica followed by their cleanser. 

The Cerave Hydrating cleanser was lovely for about two days, then white little bumps appeared on my skin; Maybe due to less cleansing power that my skin needs. Went back to their foaming cleanser and haven‚Äôt any problems since day one of using it.

Best of luck with everything!

 I use mine like a foundation tbh. It‚Äôs a little green at first to help with redness but when you rub it in it goes beige - the perfect shade of beige for me to even help reduce the appearance of pimples or the bags under my eyes. It‚Äôs a multi-feature product, as I like to describe it.

It has light coverage for those wanting to hide some imperfections but not go too heavy, it‚Äôs deeply moisturizing (which is perfect for me as I live in a high altitude city and suffer from dry skin) AND it has SPF 30! It‚Äôs amazing! I use my fingers and just blend it in really well.  I use a make up brush to apply it kind of like foundation.  I put small dots over my face and just rub in with my fingers reaaally well in circular motions. It‚Äôs thick so it takes a minute but it blends in with the skin tone quickly and if you blend it in with your fingers or a blender, it‚Äôll be just fine! Less is more! I had this issue at first too and cut back on how much I use and it goes on so much more even now Thank you! I‚Äôve been using 2% hydroquinone and though it works, it burns my skin Thank you! Will check these out Honestly I can notice a bit of fading and a lot of smoothness overnight. Significant results come in 2-3 month increments I‚Äôd say I don‚Äôt use it with the azeliac acid, I think it‚Äôs safe to do so but it would just get too pill-y. I use it at night only because it pills under makeup and follow it with cosrx snail mucin essence, squalane, and moisturizer  How many drops do you use? And do you rub your hands together and then apply it on your face? Sorry for the questions, I want to add it into my skincare and want your input.  Is it better than salicylic acid? [deleted] For sure:

Niacinamide in the morning followed by moisturizer and sunscreen

Azalaic Acid in the evening followed by the Rosehip Seed Oil Ok, will do, thanks!  Yeah I‚Äôve heard so many good things about it but I still get overwhelmed at the variety of products! Is there any product in your pic that you would recommend that is more effective at clearing hyperpigmentation? Thank you so much I thought I just had to live with it or consider microdermabrasion.. what's your opinion on that? What the heck! I missed out haha. Mine arrived with a regular silver cap.  ok i‚Äôll definitely try some of these thanks! I like anything from their water bank line. Usually use their toner, essence, emulsion, and cream.  I'll have this post saved for any updates lol hahaha [deleted] Honestly, the ever-so-slight peeling was worth it, as the azelaic acid made such a huuuuge improvement to my skin/acne.  As of 9:57pm on Feb 4, 2019, it‚Äôs still available on the Sephora US website. If it does go away you can get the Korean export from Amazon.  Thanks for the recommendation! I‚Äôve been reading the FAQ and trying to decide how to start getting help for this. I have such a horrible habit of picking at my skin and I‚Äôm trying so hard not to. For me, I get cysts that are very painful and I pick to relieve the pain. I‚Äôm lucky in that my skin tends to bounce back and eventually the hyperpigmentation lightens, but it‚Äôs so bad this time, that I need help and I want to do right by my skin.  Thanks! üòä I use this. The smell is horrible, it's all metallic. Anyone else? I ordered from the website directly. Oh thank you! I'll look into their vit c for sure! I think it's the only other product I need to incorporate! Exactly! Also, if you really like an oil but it's "too oily" on it's own, try mixing it with your moisturizer. That's what I do for rose hip in the morning and the TO marula at night.  Have you found that it has helped to fade any scarring you might have had? This is a huge issue for me and I've heard it recommended for that before. It adds extra hydration and brightness to your skin. You can apply it post night time moisturizer on it's own as an added step or mix a few drops into your moisturizer if you don't love that all over oil feeling. I personally mix mine in my moisturizer in the morning and then use TO marula oil at night.  You don‚Äôt need that waiting time for it. It‚Äôs not a retinoid like tretinoin. Do you mix the HL with the Azelaic acid to make it more spreadable or just apply it before? I gave it a try this morning and so far so good!  Great! Thank you! I‚Äôll stick to the products then  What %? Ah, I just started this a couple weeks ago and was wondering how long it was supposed to take. Thanks!

EDIT: What's interesting is that it seems the size of the bottle is not big enough to last the 3+ months that it would take to see results. I can imagine folks going through the whole bottle and thinking it did nothing, so not purchasing it again. thanks for your reply & tip! appreciate it Thanks a lot! Is ur skin sensitive? Thanks!
 Ohhh

Thanks!
I was using the TO's Ascorbic Acid 8% +Aloha Arbutin 2%...without much effect. It was only too 

I have read that hyperpigmentation takes time especially with the one I was using.

I plan on trying the one with HA spheres or the Ascorbic Powder Oh, so your derm didnt prescribe or recommend skin care? It doesn‚Äôt mention that in the description. Nice to hear it works wonders! I'll grab a sample as soon as I can :) plus my birthday is coming up so more reason to splurge lol I have used the Clinique balm (Take The Day Away)but I am currently using Palmer‚Äôs Cleansing Oil.  I ordered it from Target.  Stay away from Burt‚Äôs Bees - it was so irritating to my eyes!!

 Currently using the Banila Co Clean It Zero (Purifying version). Seems to pair fairly well with the Cerave so far I do. The normal cleansing face wash works better for me.  Yes! Ill be using it as if it was my foundation as it does help with the redness and not makes me feel too insecure about some of the hyperpigmentation left. Does it have actual long term effects or is it just a foundation/sunscreen? Make sure you use it as directed, you might need to space out the applications. Don‚Äôt use other actives until the burning sensation goes away. Be super careful with the sun now, sunscreen and definitely hats while outside. And remember to take a break after 3-4 months of use! The glycolic acid gives me a tiny bit of a stinging at first, which has gone away with time..but the azaleic acid feels so smooth and non-irritating, so if you have sensitive skin I would suggest to try that over glycolic acid. :) This junk changed my skin care game. I usually rub my hands together and then apply to my face. (As much as the dropper can hold)

Wait about 15-30 seconds, then moisturize. 

My skin is combination and acne prone, and I'm surprised, even my SO commented on how clear my skin is.  I would say about 4 drops..however it's kind of thick so it doesn't really come out in a way to count the drops. Basically just enough to cover your face. And yeah I just rub it in with my finger tips, kind of massaging it in.  AzA takes longer to see results, salicylic will be better at taming active breakouts and AzA at preventing them. It also helps prevent and heal PIH/PIE quicker. I've had the best results using both.   Yes! I even started to use a makeup brush to help blend it üòÇ Thank you so much! You can talk to their specialists and they'll be able to recommend what will most likely work for you! Their affordability makes it easy to switch after you finish products and want to try new ones  Azelaic acid! Make sure you try it at least 3 months before you decide if it does or doesn't work for you though!  I haven't really looked too much into it, but I do hope to go the laser treatment option for those deep big pore scars in hope that they reduce the size. I know it's pretty pricey, so I'll be saving up for it. However, with these products it's improved my skin about 75% I'd say :) so not too bad considering most of these are pretty affordable!  I just remembered why I also chose this one over the other one! The other one has niacinamide which I'm already getting from the ordinary so I probably didn't want to overdo it..I think if you're not using that already it would probably be a good product. I'll get a small bottle.next time and experiment hehe Thank you! üòä I live in canada and when i looked it wasn't available anymore! And they no longer sell it in stores q.q. i found it on amazon u.s.a but again... canada and my u.s prime doesnt transfer to prime canada. Yes! I mix it with the Laneige lotion pictured :) I haven't tried the Marula oil yet, but my best friend who's a skincare enthusiast swears by it, so I'll definitely be trying it! How does it compare to the rose hip oil?  not OP but I had pretty rough scarring on my cheeks and within 2 weeks of using azelaic acid they were significantly less noticeable. I don‚Äôt use it very often anymore, but about 6 months of 5x/week use and my scars are almost completely gone.  I haven't used it long enough to say it will drastically help but considering the short amount of time I've used it it's definitely good for scarring/hyperpigmentation! Highly recommend! Thank you!  I was told you have to wait 30 mins for acids to do their job effectively. After I started waiting, my skin seemed a lot softer and fresh, so I just go with it.  I hadn‚Äôt thought about mixing it, but maybe that would be better! I normally just apply them separately. If you have any oil treatments in your routine I would definitely apply the Azelaic Suspension afterward.

Lol who made the rule that so much skincare only comes in 1oz. Makes sense for some things like vitamin c, oils, and eye creams but others things, not so much. 

Tbh that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger on buying it yet. I‚Äôve done my research but I‚Äôm cringing on the price for the size (the PC one is $36) considering as you said I‚Äôd probably need at least 2 tubes to give it a fair shot. I might end up buying the TO one but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd be into the silicone base (not against the ingredient just not into the texture/having to re order my routine I guess). 

Glad I could share though, Dr Dray is great at these overviews. hope the azelaic works out for you :)  Seriously! After realizing how little it was I wish I wouldn't have purchased a few more lol No problem! :)  When it came to products my dermatologist prescribed I was, however none of these and other over the counter ones I've tried have given me any bad side affects, so in general I would say no.  That's the exact one I was using! Haha and plan on trying the HA one too! üòÜ  Not the products pictured. The ones they gave me all made my skin worse  It does  I‚Äôve only been using it for about a month so I couldn‚Äôt personally say whether or not it has long term effects. Yes, right now, I‚Äôm just taking a break! I‚Äôve been putting aquaphor since it dried my skin really bad. New to all this! I‚Äôll definitely check these out. My skin is really sensitive. My dermatologist prescribed 4% hydroquinone, but I can‚Äôt even imagine what that‚Äôll do to my skin i was wondering if i could get some advice! i recently bought the niacinamide and zinc and it broke out my cheeks and forehead. regular acne on top of some small bumps on my forehead. :(  had to stop using it immediately and now stick to hyaluronic acid. do you have any idea as to why this happened?  Do you mind me to ask.. how do you use them? One AM one PM or both AM/PM?  [deleted] Hmmm.. on the "treating hyperpigmentation" thread on the sidebar it says that Glycolic Acid is effect at treating it. That's also what the product is advertised to do. How long did you use it? Maybe it differs from person to person? That‚Äôs such a bummer, I‚Äôm really sorry! I think they are both equally good I just like to use as many good ingredients as possible and like to spread the oil love around. I use rose hip in the morning as to me it feels more brightening and marula at night because it feels more like a night time oil if that makes any sense lol  thank you so much! my scarring is on my cheeks as well. Iirc TO has azeliac acid as well. glad you could fade your scars. I know that must have felt like quite an achievement! thank you so much!! congrats on finding a routine that‚Äôs working for you ‚ò∫Ô∏è As long as you see a positive difference in your skin, you do you! I personally haven‚Äôt noticed any in mine. Thanks for the link! Amazing! Thanks do you use the azeliac acid everyday? Wow hahaa Dang.  Oops. I was looking for the SPF protection number. Thanks! How well does it blend in and does it look cakey?  My skin didn't like it either :( I was sad considering the rave reviews this item gets. Yeah I've read some people break out from it. It's like your skin either loves it or hates it.  It might be the zinc. The same thing happened to me and took a month for my skin to recover.  I have no idea what could cause this. Have you out ruled purging and skin sensitivities?  So much better right?! I hated having to use extra soup to remove from my fingers after  It did help a little but not as drastic as the azaleic did for me. This is my second bottle..so it's been about 8 months I believe. It's possible I need a higher percentage, every person's skin is different so I'm sure its more effective on some people than others. Haha yes! Ohh! I might try that! I don't use any oils in the morning so I can just incorporate one of the two there. :)  it was the TO azelaic acid! it has really changed the way I see myself. i‚Äôm not trying to hide my skin all the time. i hope it has the same effect for you!  Thank you! üòä Maybe it's just skin type or difference in skincare habits and history. Maybe it's in my head. Either way my skin feels softer than baby butt.  No since I'm using the glycolic acid I switch every night between the two, but if I end up not using glycolic anymore then yes, I'd use it every night. :) It blends in really well for me. I don‚Äôt use a whole lot - a little goes a long way. I use it as base coverage for every day but if I ever wanna cover up more I just put a little concealer on under my eyes/on darker spots. 

I found myself when I first got it going really heavy handed and using a ton. It really isn‚Äôt necessary. Believe me when I say a little goes a long way! I‚Äôve had it about a month and I‚Äôm not even halfway done with it yet. Start with a little and work your way up is my best advice for it not looking too cakey.

I definitely wouldn‚Äôt put it on top of anything either, only as a base. And some foundations that I put on top of it caused some separation. I was using it as a base and putting Tarte‚Äôs Rainforest of the Sea foundation on top for more full-coverage and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because ROTS is a water-based foundation but it made me look hella cakey and gross. That‚Äôs why I switched to a light concealer instead of foundation and it‚Äôs made a huge difference. If you are putting on makeup make sure to give the mix time to absorb though. I don't wear makeup most days so it doesn't bother me but one the occasion that I've done my makeup right after I just have to use more powder than normal or adjust the number of drops of oil I use.  Thanks!!!!  Thanks a lot! Have you noticed it actually helping your acne/redness or is it just helpful for the moment it‚Äôs on?  Ah good to know! Thank you! üòä Both! My acne has pretty much disappeared since I‚Äôve started using it and it takes redness away immediately. I see you stopped using the 10 in 1 products [deleted] one of us one of us  Oh thank god!  Colgate is a great moisturiser :) Don't forget the sunscreen! The most important skin care step of them all! Unpopular opinion; If the shower gel was working and you weren‚Äôt having any actual problems, I genuinely don‚Äôt see the issue üòÖ

I *wish* I could wash my face with shower gel! I‚Äôd save so much money.  Goodness, now if I could convince my Mr to stop using the zest bar on his face.  Jesus Christ, I cringed as I read this notification on my phone.  Please help.. is the Cerave really good as people say? :( I feel like shit  My husband actually did not know women have to take their makeup off each night and cleanse until we got married.  His way of washing his face is to let the shampoo drip down his face.  I would love for him to learn skincare is not just a woman thing. how funny I just started using this cleanser as a shower gel as I find it too drying! 

ps get sunscreen, do ya hear? My face felt tight and dry after reading this Congragifuckinglations I recently bought this cleanser as well. My skin is doing so much better lately. Hope you have good results! I bought that for my husband after he asked me for help with his acne, put it over next to his body wash in the shower where he couldn't miss it, and I'm not sure he's used a drop ... Maybe he'll pick it up one day. What‚Äôs that tube next to your cleanser called? I used it before and it‚Äôs good but can‚Äôt remember the name  lmao are you me. used to be one of those guys who thought a shampoo-conditioner-body wash combo was brilliant. and totally acceptable for use on my face.  I‚Äôll never forget the day I switched to Colgate. Really refreshing ya know? Hooray! :) Next step moisturizer!  Shower gel as cleanser?! Omg that just made me cringe so bad 

Didn‚Äôt your face feel like a giant dried out nast?!?! Congratulations. I think if the shower gel was working then you‚Äôre okay, everyone‚Äôs skin is different. Make sure not to overdo it with cleanser, that cleanser was still very drying for my face so I switched to the hydrating version instead. [deleted] This is how it starts.... ha Oddly enough, I actually use a low-ph cleanser as my shower gel! Praise be! My husband uses shampoo... this is the one thing that has really improved my acne, using an actual face wash (micellular water gel) instead of just my body wash.  Is cerave good?
 I have the exact same CeraVe cleanser that I stopped using because it dries out my face too much, and yet I still use bar soap on my body. Thank you for the new idea :)  Yay! May I recommend a fabulous moisturizer with sunscreen from Lush... Cosmetic Lad & Celestial are incredible‚ò∫Ô∏è I'm still waiting for my boyfriend to say these words  Is this shit supposed to be really good? I've never seen it in Canada I used to use shower gel as a cleanser too! The laziness gets to you lol It‚Äôs taken me years to convince my husband to switch from whichever-shower-gel-is-on-offer, to Aveeno which is specially formulated for psoriasis sufferers like him. I feel like convincing him to use an actual cleanser would take several lifetimes.
 You can use Cetaphil for face and body tho. [deleted] ... okay so the people from ScA told me to do this and since this is basically the most Internet famous I'll ever become here we go people.

I got hella oily skin, like oils for days. I'm talking come back from a long uni day and windshield wipe that layer off your forehead. Pro tip for you lassies, USE MOISTURISER. What's that? You think adding moisturiser will be too much oil on you skin? That's why you're pores are working overtime to quench your thirsty skin honey. Don't repeat my mistakes. Moisturise. 

AM

used to be Sanex, now it's Cera Ve foaming cleanser 

Nivea soft moisturiser

PM

Again, used to beSanex shower gel, now its Cera Ve foaming cleanser 

Nivea soft moisturiser 

Now please don't crucify me for the fact that I don't have a sunscreen. I ordered the Kao Biore UV aqua rich watery essence one today. 

Also the Nivea soft moisturiser is pretty good ngl. I see you there, my little broke college student chomping down on a bowl of 80 cent ramen. It does the job for a cheap price and doesn't feel taky, or maybe that's my opinion cause I went from using a product that was like 80% propolis to this and that stuff just sat on your face. 




 More shelfies like this, please.  [deleted] Now we need to get you some nice lip balm, a tinted moisturizer, and some light coverage concealer!  You will soon be kpop ready! You mean like 10 in 1 shampoo, shave gel, bodywash, car cleaner, dishwasher soap, window cleaner, fabric softener, tick repellent, oven cleaner, lube, that smells like Cobra venom cigar smoke? Who wouldn't want that ?! I used to know a girl, she had a dozen moisturizers...one of them found out about it, broke her out so bad she ended up in a dermatologist's office on Guerrero Street. Definitely don't sleep on the moisturizers!! I only used wash for years and saw dramatic changes when I started to use both  Honestly they smell good and ladies love it so üòå Gooba-gooble, gooba-gobble! One of us
One of us
One of us Yall have converted me Oh man it's the best! All the youtube life hack tutorials are using it bro better jump on that bandwagon!  Maybe I haven‚Äôt found the right one, but the few I‚Äôve tried have me feeling like my face is completely clogged.  So I just use regular 
non-SPF YES! Sunscreen is by far the most important step! Oil-free if possible  I concur A moisturizer with sunscreen is a must I almost had a heart attack yersteday . I‚Äôm on holiday and I thought I forgot my sunscreen. I was like ‚ÄúOMG!!! What do my skincareaddiction people will think of me now ?!‚Äù Yep, I have 4 of them lol but I think I finally found my sunscreen I just buy body wash with spf nowadays What product do you use?  I haven‚Äôt found one I‚Äôd like to wear every day.   A lot of dudes do that with 0 issue. I get a pimple simply by sleeping on the same pillow for too long smh  I think it‚Äôs more a matter of potential long term damage. It might seem fine now but shower gel is generally pretty harsh for the face and you could see the effects later on down the line. It‚Äôs one of those things where (in my opinion) it‚Äôs better to just be safer now than have to deal with it later.  I buy a shower gel in bulk for my face that is four to five times more expensive than Dove when both are purchased at the lowest possible price from an official distributor. But it means that it's a cheap face wash for the whole family! It's QV gentle wash, an Australian product available in South East Asia. It's 15% glycerin and uses only mild surfactants, so I feel fine using it. Yeah I had a friend who broke out from using fave wash but face cleared up after using body soap  I use my Mario Badescu shower gel on my face when I'm showering. Nothing bad has happened yet.  Mine uses Irish spring (and I know it's not quite the sub, but uses 3-in-1 body wash, shampoo, and conditioner on his curly hair). Refuses to change, cause he doesn't really care, it cleans. My SO uses Dial. Drives me nuts. I have extra cleansers he can use, but he refuses. He calls all my skincare products my ‚Äúpotions,‚Äù like I‚Äôm a witch or something üòÇ In my experience, yes. It's a line of high quality products that are available in drugstores and are formulated with some skincare holy grail ingredients and, in my experience, fragrance free.

For example, the AM lotion is SPF 30 but is moisturizing and doesn't smell like SPF. It's a little thick and takes some rubbing in, but it does what it says it does on the bottle and saves you a step in your morning routine.

The PM lotion is a lot of people's favorite moisturizer. Like many of their other products it contains hyaluronic acid and 3 types of ceramides, it has few or none filler ingredients, it's fragrance free, lightweight, and wears well all night.


When I had closed comedies a couple years ago I switched to their daily lotion (the bottle used to say non comedogenic) and it greatly helped reduce my CCs.


I recently bought their SA cream in the tub. I'm having second thoughts because it seems pretty thick and they actually make a thinner lotion which might be better for the face. The tub just seemed more bang for your buck since it contains more product. It's also so thick that you can be conservative with your application and it'll go a long way.


All in all, yes, CeraVe is usually a very good line of products. Especially for those wanting to keep a simple and efficient regimen.  It's really not. Breaks me out, over dries my skin while not feeling like it was rinsed off.  I'll do a week trial and update you on my experience if that'll help It's the Nivea soft moisturiser I think it's with vitamin E and jojoba oil and yea I love it Oof tell me about it, keeps you're skin minty fresh Tube right beside it is Nivea soft moisturiser, seems to be working aight
 Shower gel is made for your body, not your face. So it‚Äôll be too harsh for your face and may dry your skin out or even compromise your moisture barrier.  The pH may be too high for your facial skin! Ideally, you want something gentle for your face.  Shower gel usually has fragrance, which many people here want to avoid.  Also, the pH might be too high; you want something with a pH around 5.5.

Shower gel isn't inherently bad.  There are companies that make good shower gels like CeraVe and Paula's Choice and those can be used on your face. Because even if it doesn't cause comodones or dehydrated skin right now, it can cause damage to your epidermis over time because of the harshness of the sulfates. 
Mind you an easy fix to this is simply opting for liquid or bar CLEANSERS instead of regular soap because it's less sulfates and a better ph balance. Dove or Cetaphil bars are a great example of an "all in one" soap for the skin that you can also use on the face.  Do you watch Handmaids Tale lol No! I actually gasped at this Micellar Yes, very good. [deleted] You unfortunately need to invest in order to find the right one  I also love ultra bland cleanser!!!! It‚Äôs available in Canada. Ive seen it at Shoppers Drug Mart (in the regular skincare aisle) and Walmart (usually in pharmacy skincare section).  It‚Äôs basically the best drugstore cleanser. It‚Äôs not packed with nasty shit that most drugstore products have, it‚Äôs fairly cheap, and it‚Äôs readily available in a lot of places (at least in the US and I think Europe).  I can only use it on my body. It dries the f out of my face.  It really depends on the shower gel (and on your skin). In general fragrances are not so great for your facial skin and the foaming agents in shower gel may be to harsh for your face. Cerave is rather gentle. you really did that didn‚Äôt you I laughed, the bar is set low Different strokes for different folks my man Haha what a story Mark Moisturizers as in lotion? I‚Äôm new here  Oh I should stop using the fragrance- free ones then  I was converted a couple months ago... gl mate, next you‚Äôre gonna have 7 moisturizers sitting on your shelf. CeraVe AM moisturizer with sunscreen does the trick for me. It actually helps me prevent breakouts from rosacea and sun exposure.  Asian sunscreens are where it‚Äôs at tbh. My favorite is Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk because it‚Äôs alcohol and fragrance free, but people also love Biore, Missha, etc. Some that I've tried that I like are:

Olay Complete Sensitive Daily Moisturizer with Sunscreen (SPF 15 or 30)

CeraVe AM Moisturizer (SPF 30)

The Ordinary Mineral UV Filters SFP 30 (WARNING: this is a physical sunscreen and leaves whitecast)

Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch SPF 30 (has other SPF options from 15 to 55) 

&#x200B;

I change it up depending what's on sale, whether I'm wearing makeup, and what season it is. In wintertime I'm basically never outside when the sun is up so I stick with the Olay 15, but in the summer I use an SPF 30 and reapply at least once throughout the day. Try Biore sunscreens from Japan. Light and completely absorb in with no residue. Supergoop invisible shield! Omg. I hate sunscreen & it always breaks me out. But my friend recommended this and it just feels like a silicone primer (if you‚Äôve ever used one). Doesn‚Äôt smell like sunscreen at all. Goes on dry and keeps my oil free  I literally just use Neutrogena clear face (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called) and it feels so lightweight on my skin.  Jack Black double duty moisturizer has broad spectrum spf in it. It's prob the only one i've used that felt lightweight.  Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel checking in. SPF50, has a pump + cover, and comes with a good amount!  Thanks everyone!  You‚Äôre the best! I bought a 24pack of pillowcases from a hospitality supply place online so I can change mine daily/every other day without having to do excessive amounts of laundry. No regrets. My eczema can flare (no exaggeration, unfortunately) from lighting a fragrant candle.. body wash would wreck me ._. But power to the ones who can! So jealous  Me too. Just change the sheets once a week and I'm golden. Always shower and moisturise before bed. Do ya'll sleep face down on your pillow or something... Isn‚Äôt the issue just that a harsher shower gel strips away oils and dries out your skin? If your skin doesn‚Äôt feel dry then I don‚Äôt see any long term damage occuring Is there supposed to be a problem with using shower gel for the rest of your body? I‚Äôve been doing that for years, but I wash my face with some Cerave cleanser.  Maybe try a facial bar from Shea Moisture, the black one smells somewhat ‚Äúmanly‚Äù Ugh I can feel my skin drying out just hearing it's name. We bought a Costco box of them once and gave it away after a week  If you check out /r/haircarescience I think 2in1s are actually suggested.  Politely inform him that, statistically, in 20 years time, if you are still a smooth-skinned voodoo priestess and he looks like a bag of old spanners left out in the rain, your eye may begin to wonder... What's wrong with regular Ivory soap for your skin?! Thank you so much for your reply!

So if I understand correctly I should get the following products;

- AM lotion 30 spf (moisterizer)
- PM lotion (moisterizer)
- SA cream in a tub

I see, is it also good for my oily skin? I also have some rosacea on the places right beside my nose on the left and right. Should I also rub it on that? Since when I put moisterizer on those spots it gets really red. 

I also have bumps on my forehead, they‚Äôre fairly small and depends on the light but somewhat noticeable. They are not white or blackheads.. just bumps :(

I‚Äôll visit the drugstore tomorrow! Thank you! Curious how you will experience it :) Awesome! Moist skin is happy skin! üòå Would that still hold true for the gels that are for body+face? Paula‚Äôs choice has amazing skin care products Ill try it, my face is pretty bad I just got the same one! It doesn't seem to dry my skin out as much as the CeraVe just like you've found. Thumbs up so far! The CeraVe is just kinda sitting in the shower... Ultrabland is the stuff of gods! I usually do ultra bland/buche de noel in the winter & fresh pharmacy/angels on bare skin in the summer. Lush is the best for skincare imo (mainly skin sensitive to chemicals like benzoyl peroxide & what not) Ah makes sense, I don't have a shoppers in my town Damn that‚Äôs too bad Anyway how's your sex life? Yes! Usually a lighter-weight lotion specifically designed for your face that won‚Äôt clog your pores. CeraVe and Cetaphil both make pretty gentle moisturizers that you can buy at any drug/grocery store, if you‚Äôre looking for a place to start.  Yes!, Many guys like me that were new to this whole skincare thing believed that "if my skin is oily, I shouldn't use moisturizer, that's for people with dry skin" which is very untrue! Your skin produces more oil because you're not moisturizing! Blew my mind  Still early initiate, why 7 different ones? I recently found out that I have rosacea but I had no idea this would help prevent breakouts? If anything I thought the sunscreen in it may make it worse. If you don‚Äôt mind could you expand a bit on what exactly helps you prevent the breakouts with this! I‚Äôm new and would appreciate some more information so much as I‚Äôve been eyeing the CeraVe am moisturizer for a while now!  This is the first one that's worked for me as well.  Tiny bit of whitecast (and I'm pretty white already), but it goes away easily. I had such high hopes for that one since I have a really red face but it just makes my face redder :((  I never thought to try that one!  I‚Äôm using the ceravePM moisturizer for day and night, lol. How does it help prevent rosacea breakouts if you don't mind me asking? Belief is really nice too Wow thanks!!! I have the UV perfect milk and I hate it. Maybe if I used makeup it would be fine, but it leaves enough of a white cast that I can use it to hide in snow.  üëçüèºüëçüèº Holy shit this is genius. I think my pillowcases are what‚Äôs causing me to still get the occasional cystic acne sprouts on my chin about once or twice a month, but I definitely don‚Äôt want to wash them 2-3 times a week. I‚Äôm definitely looking into this! Brilliant!  I feel like the 'long term damage' is probably just normal ageing. So idk maybe you'll get wrinkles before others. Which makes sense if that's gonna bother you, change from shower gel cleanser to a gentle routine with sunscreen. But that's more lack of prevention than damage in my eyes.  That one can be drying for face and body! Just FYI It depends on the 2 in 1, because there are two distinct types:

2-in-1 shampoo and conditioners? Boo, bad.

2-in-1 *cleansing* conditioners? Woohoo, wonderful, possibly what your hair has been dreaming of. It's about eliminating the surfactant and foaming agents in most shampoos that make conditioners necessary in the first place.

I don't think that there's any of the second type that would also work on the body. Don't know if this is a rhetorical question but one way that soap kills bacteria is by having a high, alkaline pH (9-10). Which is fine for your body, but if you're acne-prone this might cause problems because your skin has an "acid mantle" that maintains a slightly acidic pH of 5.5 to keep bacteria and other contaminants out. No problem. Everyone on this sub is united in knowing how genuinely and deeply upsetting poor skin can be, so I am very glad to be of any help.


I didn't mens to imply you should grab those products specifically asap, nor that those were the best of the CeraVe line, nor that CeraVe was the only line worth buying from. What you buy should be tailored to your needs. For example, if you sleep in your makeup, eat like shit, and have never used a moisturizer but you have flawless skin, I'm not going to arbitrarily recommend CeraVe or anything else to you. Everything in your routine should be tailored for you, what you like, and what your skin reacts positively to. Unfortunately it's largely trial and error and a lot of time spent with your skin to know what it likes or doesn't like. Thankfully, drugstores have a 30 day return or exchange policy so if something doesn't work for you for over 2 weeks, return or exchange it for something that may work better.


I have normal skin (neither oily or dry) so I would be able to tell you what's best for that. However, I have heard a lot of praise for:

- The wonders of oil cleansing

- Adding oil to your moisturizer

- Using cold water to wash instead of hot

- Using a hyaluronic acid serum in your regimen

- Not drying out your skin unnecessarily with stripping foaming cleansers or oil-free products

- Opting for a non greasy day moisturizer and sunscreen 

- Carrying blotting papers 


All to be wonderful steps towards making your skin produce less oil long term.


I also don't have roaacea and I really know nothing about it. It seems you and I have very different skin with very different concerns so I'd recommend that you continue your research and perhaps make some personal posts looking for others with skin like yours to give you advice that works for them.


Your forehead issue does sound like the one thing we may have in common. Those skin coloured bumps are often either fungal acne or closed comedones. I had those bumps too and like I said, switching to the CeraVe daily lotion helped me a lot. Something I think is important to distinguish however is that I bought that lotion when the bottle still said "non comedogenic." I haven't seen that bottle around lately so I'm not sure if they've reformulated that product.


Some other things I did at the time that got rid of my CCs were adding a few drops of tea tree oil to my lotion. You'll know you've done too much when it stings and burns. Tea tree oil must be diluted (which is why I used it in my lotion) before application. Or it can further irritation. I also toned my face after washing with pure witch hazel on a cotton pad. Yes, this isn't a great idea and it definitely did strip my face of oils. I'd recommend something like Trader Joe's or Thayer's witch hazel toner instead which is formulated with witch hsdel as a main ingredient but it's also made to actually be used on your face.  Since you have oily skin, you might be better off getting the Daily Moisturizing Lotion in the pump. The CeraVe in the tub is pretty thick and heavy. I have extremely oily skin, and the pump is what I use, along with the Foaming Cleanser (the one in OP's picture). Oookay so one week has almost passed. I like it so far. It didn't seem to break me out. Now my skin is mainly oily in my T zone and chin but my cheeks are normal.

First of all, the cleanser doesn't feel stripping. I mean that after I use it my face doesn't feel extremely dried out and tight. Obviously I use a moisturiser but the cleanser itself did feel gentle, in my experience. I found that my cheek acne is clearing up, slowly, but I feel like a change is starting to take place in the right direction. I can't expect much progress from a week haha but I do see a good change. 

So for me this cleanser is a good option. No new acne has popped up on my face for the past week which is a good sign plus it is gentle. I think the best way to figure out if it suits you is to try it out but before that maybe research other brands and products as well and do a comparison just in case there are other cleansers that suit your face type better.

Good luck in your searches!  TBH skincare is the only context in which someone can say "moist" and I don't recoil in terror. Likely, especially if they're male targeted. I dislike how the male hygiene products put using quality ingredients low on the importance list. 

It's not skincare but my bf just started using my really nice shampoo and conditioner for his long hair instead of his single tub of soap for everything. His hair looks 100x better now for using something created specifically for that unique body part. Check the sidebar for the basic sca routine and follow that. It will likely do wonders. I agree! It smells food, feels good, derived from good stuff, company takes care of environment, and their products are fresh.  [I'm assuming you mean this link for the lotion?](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_194_tr_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=1CBGD899X8XCP81EC49M)

and should I get a facial cleanser(like the picture), or is soap + lotion fine? Trying out different stuff when you're starting out can be a good idea. (but don't forget to patch test)  exerggerating, I just got really into skincare after I started :/// When you have rosacea, anything that causes inflammation can trigger a flare up, which can cause acne-like spots. Sun exposure causes inflammation, ergo, sunscreen helps prevent rosacea flare ups.

Also, the CeraVe one has a handful of highly effective, soothing ingredients in it. It doesn't work under makeup for me or it's all I'd wear. Have you tried a physical sunscreen, or one for sensitive skin? I'm allergic to avobenzene and it irritates my skin, so I stick to ones without it.

&#x200B; The AM one is so nice. It‚Äôs still moisturizing but pretty light so you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre just wearing a mask, lol.  Sun exposure is a trigger  for rosacea.  Dry skin is a trigger for pimples in general. This stuff handles both for very well.  Have you tried Biore Aqua Rich instead? Doesn't seem to have the white cast issues. Have you considered sleeping with a [silicone face mask on?](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Reusable-Silicon-Nutrition-Evaporation/dp/B077TNGBC1)
They can be easily washed every day and will stop your face touching the pillow! If you use two pillows, it can just be as simple as sleeping on a different side of one everyday. You just gotta buy a couple more and that'll last you for a whole week.  Yes it has anti acne properties. Depends on your skin type if it‚Äôll dry it out or not. 
It's not as harsh as cleansers with acne medication in them. Thank you so much for the detailed explanation and advice! Really appreciate it. 

I saved your comment, I‚Äôll research the products and see what‚Äôll work best for me!

I might buy the daily lotion 30 spf for the bumps on my forehead and the foaming cleanser as someone in this thread recommended it for oily skin! And indeed, if it isn‚Äôt effective for me I‚Äôll bring it back to the store.

Thank you so much for the tips! I see! Is the daily moisterizer lotion also 30 spf?
Thank you so much, i‚Äôll check those two products today.  Lol and why is that?  Lush is truly the best. There is nothing not to love in there. They‚Äôre the friendliest people ever, looove to give out free samples, & everything you said. The smell & their dedication to the environment are top notch. I have to go this week to exchange some empty black pots for a free face mask!  i forgot to patch test. Everything worked out though lol. Why doesn't it work under makeup?  I have and I like it more. Unfortunately I have seborrheic dermatitis, and it could potentially make me break out.  I have, actually, but I never looked it up, I believed I was making up the whole ‚Äúmask while you sleep‚Äù thing haha. Now that I know I‚Äôm not, DEFINITELY looking this up, too. Thanks!! No, it isn't unfortunately. I use the AM lotion in the morning (obviously), which is 30 spf, and I use the Daily Moisturizing Lotion at night. I've never tried the PM Lotion, but I've heard good things about it, as well. For some, it causes the makeup to pill or not apply nicely. There are Japanese sunscreens that are formulated to act as primers, so some prefer those to CeraVe or other American formulations. I see! Thanks for the reply.. read some reviews about both.. bought the AM facial moisterizer lotion 25 SPF (they didn‚Äôt had 30 spf :( ) 

Will get the foaming cleanser tomorrow and perhaps the night lotion too! Omg, I occasionally use a light foundation, just to even out my skin tone, etc. and I‚Äôve been wondering what was causing it to apply so poorly sometimes, but totally okay other times. And now that I‚Äôm thinking abut it, it only applies poorly in the morning after I used my AM lotion! 

Do you have any recommendations for an AM lotion/sunscreen that works as primer as well?  Biore watery essence works well for a lot of people, especially those w oily skin. It has alcohol in it so only try if that doesn't irritate your skin. **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* This photo called me poor The first time I spent the night at my boyfriend‚Äôs house early into our relationship, he walked me through his Tatcha routine before we went to bed and I nearly wept with happiness after dating so many dudes who scoffed at moisturizer.

Now we‚Äôre dabbling together into more Korean skincare brands. I stan a dude with good taste in skincare products!! My Routine:

1. Morning: Tatcha Deep Cleanse, Tatcha The Essence, Tatcha Water Cream, Tatcha Silk Peony Eye Cream, 3 Drops of Tatcha Camelia Beauty Oil in my beard
2. Evening: Tatcha Rice Polish, Tatcha The Essence, Tatcha Violet-C Brightening Serum, Tatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Night Concentrate,

* I Went into Sephora about a year ago to see if there was a solution for my oily face, I hated it and I looked really "shiny" and red all of the time. After a couple of weeks with this routine both the redness and oil problem were a fraction of what they once were. I have a 95% tatcha routine as well. I get most of mine from qvc where I can break up payments and once a year the routine is a special that you can get auto delivered all year. Gonna put my oily boyfriend on Tatcha. He‚Äôs getting close to 50 and is face is oily with minor acne. What kinda job do you work LOL. Y‚Äôall hiring?That shelf looks amazing!! Great collection! Couple products that has helped me a ton with oily skin is Biologique Recherces P50 and Masque Vivant. P50 exfoliates and masque vivant really cleans out the skin. Can‚Äôt recommend enough üôÇ If you like tatcha‚Äôs vitamin C serum I highly recommend the vitamin C mask as well. It‚Äôs pretty pricey like all their products but hands down one of the best masks I‚Äôve ever used! I gotta say their lip mask is one of my favorites. It's definitely a luxe spend but the little spatula that comes with it is sooo handy. ooooh so pretty what‚Äôs your favourite product on ur shelfie?? do you find that the essence has made a big difference in your skincare routine? been eyeing it for a while but hesitate at the price point lol Can we please stop commenting about people's financial situation? There is nothing charming about a sea of people commenting on how poor they are and saying OP's skincare could pay X bills, etc. I'm sure any of us would have more expensive stuff if we could afford it, as would any sane person. Have a little grace and be happy for people who are fortunate enough to have nice things, that they likely worked hard to have. 

Done ranting. I could pay my student loans with that shelf Everyone loves this essence! I‚Äôm so curious about it I‚Äôm debating about the night cream during Sephora‚Äôs sale. Can you live without it or is it amazing? I used to use all the Tatcha products also. But honestly, for the money you are paying for that there's much more effective and affordable products out there. Tatcha has cute packaging for sure. What do you think of their water cream? I just ran out of drunk elephant protini and am looking to try another product. I found the protini to be overly heavy. Love that you even splurged on the lip mask Have you tried the Indigo cream? If so what do you think? How‚Äôs the lip mask? I‚Äôve been using various kinds of chapstick every day for years now. I‚Äôd love to shake the habit but no product has helped long term. I‚Äôm not very familiar with tat how but I have the dewy face lotion and my skin absolutely loves it. And I do. Looks like I‚Äôll be getting more samples Can you post a picture of what your skin looks like? How do you know it's for guys if you don't have it sharpied on the bottles? OP, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre getting a lot of negative comments about the cost of the items you use. If they work, don‚Äôt cause a financial burden to you, and you enjoy them ‚Äî then you just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. I think it‚Äôs wonderful that you‚Äôve found products that have given you the skin you desire. So many times, people (myself included, at times) will constantly try the ‚Äúnext best thing‚Äù, when what they had worked fine, and they end up wasting more money in the long run. Your shelf is lovely, and I‚Äôm glad your routine is working for you! Why all Tatcha though? If it's for the luxe experience then fair enough, but if you're looking for an outcomes based routine there are much, much better options. Tatcha has pretty packaging but the silicone, fragrance and phenoxyethanol are a no no for my sensitive skin. I like the Benton green tea line instead. I also love tatcha! Glad you found a routine that works for you, I was blown away by the small amount I could use to get the job done, definitely makes the price worth while. Do you mind telling which ones are your favorite products and why? May I ask if you struggled with acne and dryness too? Last year I changed my skincare routine to Tatcha way too suddenly (out of excitement to enjoy all their products). It didn‚Äôt go well, as soon as I changed it I started breaking out and I couldn‚Äôt figure out if it was a reaction to a particular product or to the lack of proper transition (or both). It took me months to realize the essence wasn‚Äôt working for me. I really wanted to love Tatcha, but sadly can‚Äôt stand the serum üòî. I am now using a new routine mix of Tatcha and Biossence. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the extra cash. How do you feel about their lip balm? Was wondering about it when I saw it in Sephora but it seems pretty goopy and messy. Have you tried the silk canvas? You mentioned oil slick....I use it as a primer and it's amazing. I can go a full 10hr shift with a mask on and I'm still matte. It's white in the container but colorless on the skin. Did you experiment with difference brands or just decided on tatcha after research? Tatcha is infused with more Japanese ingredients not Korean. Also yes, it‚Äôs not even a Japanese brand, founded by a Taiwanese American Nice AD omg i loooove Tatcha and their products! Especially their Water Cream and Rice Wash but holy I wish it wasn‚Äôt so expensive This is awesome! I‚Äôve been looking into getting some of their products (specifically a moisturizer) but I wasn‚Äôt sure which to get. Which would you say is more hydrating; the water cream or dewy skin cream? Unfortunately I currently have the opposite problem of what yours is (dry skin).

Edit: I went online and bought a lipstick on sale for seven dollars so I could use my pints to get a free sample of the water cream and pore cleanser. Super excited to try both, and thank you for everyone‚Äôs input! I‚Äôm really happy to see a post about Tatcha. The majority of my routine is Tatcha. I can‚Äôt say enough about their products. The products do last a long time and QVC has some awesome deals. Sephora and Tatcha also have some great sets for holiday. So I'm guessing you like Tatcha? hahahah 

What do you like about it? I'm not much for brand loyalty, but I'd love to know more about this specific brand. I've seen it here and there. What does that shelfe cost? Asking for a friend- ha! I tried tatcha, unfortunately it didn't go very well at all. I had a pretty severe reaction to the cream and I ended up returning about $600 worth of their products :( glad it's working for you though. I love their sunscreen and essence. Sir you are a fancy man üé© lmfao i wonder what your favourite brand is!! i'm super glad you have a single brand that's a consistent and solid hit for you :D im curious though, have you had a product from them that hasnt resulted in a pleasant experience? :0 For some reason I kept reading VIOLENT-C brightening serum and decided I need this type of product in my lifeüòÇ I got a sample of the tatcha dewy skin cream and it smells amazing and made my face silky soft, but unfortunately my skin doesn‚Äôt like it because I broke out a day after trying it. I tried 3 separate times and it was the same result every time. I use it for hand cream at night but I am so bummed that I can‚Äôt use it on my face. How do you like the sunscreen? Would you repurchase? y‚Äôall don‚Äôt need to be assholes about it. if it‚Äôs in someone‚Äôs price range to use expensive products and the products end up working really well for them, that‚Äôs their business why does everyone on this sub praise men who take care of their skin So much. like obvi this guy is doing the most but some men are like ‚Äúthinking of trying face wash‚Äù and they get like a thousand upvotes. like ladies pls support one another with the same level of enthusiasm Is your hair also oily? What do you use to stop that, my boyfriend's is SOOOO oily. Did this routine clear up acne for you, possibly? These are his problems. Ah this is such a gorgeous shelfie!! I love a good shelfie with all or most of the same brand something about that is just so pleasing. Curious about trying the Camellia Oil serum and the Kissu Lip mask... anything i should know before trying? How long did it take for your skin to stop producing as much oil? The whole year or did you notice it earlier?

Also, I can‚Äôt understand why everyone is commenting on the price. I wish I had a single solid routine rather than spending all of my money trying a bunch of stuff that doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm glad you found something that you like and that works for you! That is one aesthetically pleasing shelfie. My mishmash of products scattered on my sink vanity are jealous. I wish we could date so we could share.......... oof das espensive Wow very attractive !!! I really hope you tried a million other brands before arriving at Tatcha being your only option mr moneybags over here üëà Where can I find a man dedicated to facial cleansing Ah yes I love spending hella money for piss poor ingredients Oh, you got money. Jealous of your routine. I would love to have all these products! oh im trynna be like this i feel like a peasant lookin at this pic Someone please jerk this also Oh damn son your got Tatcha money 

You single? üëÄüëÄ Oh okay üòí This is so fucking expensive that my Ordinary bottles are protesting. Hi there,

Thank you! [deleted] It looked at my bank account and snorted The financial outlay when I started was a bit frightening, especially if it turned out not helping my skin. I started with the smallest size of everything and even some samples, and once proven I buy the biggest one when the small one runs out (better value with volume). Since they don't typically all run out at once it is fairly manageable. I also don't really need to use very much for it to work its magic. For example, the original jar of the Dewy Skin Night Concentrate lasted almost a full year using it nightly. I expect the big water cream to last me about a year at the rate I've been using it. ikr I usually just call myself poor but now I feel personally attacked My feelings exactly!  
I bought the Sephora value pack that had Tatcha Dewy Skin and considering getting the full size but lawd, this is a pricey shelfie! A man with a skincare routine....that‚Äôs a panty dropper Ughhhh my husband washes his face with shampoo. And he uses my fucking kerastase shampoo but thats a whole other fiasco. I would be so happy if I met a man with a skincare routine. My god. I‚Äôd really live up to my username for them. I aspire for this in my relationship. If the average guy only knew how attractive skincare routines are lol we‚Äôd be seeing ‚Äúloves tatcha‚Äù in tinder bios, and everyone wins! I got my boyfriend to finally use sunscreen every day and I‚Äôm very proud of that! Working on getting him to cleanse and moisturize now. Wish more guys would just do skincare... I don't see why it's seen as feminine, imo I think it's a basic step of taking care of urself. Introduced bha, cleanser and moisturiser to my s/o  which I think he sticks to sometimes so yay... Tatcha isn‚Äôt truly a korean skincare brand. It‚Äôs founded by a Taiwanese American born in Missouri. Based out of San Francisco. I had to beg my boyfriend to stop using a bar of soap on his face only. Now he uses a real face wash and sometimes moisturises! Feels. And of course his skin looks so much better than mine (and I have an actual routine). He‚Äôs a keeper! Do you have sebaceous filaments? If so, did this routine help with that? I‚Äôm a huge fan of the camellia oil cleanser. As someone who used to have bad acne (did 2 rounds of accutane), putting oil on my face was super scary. But I swear by this cleanser. It‚Äôs so gentle and lasts for a long time, so the price is more manageable. Okay, I thought the ‚ÄúOoh a man with a skincare routine, so sexy‚Äù comments were a little silly, but then I read the phrase ‚Äú3 Drops of Tatcha Camellia Beauty Oil in my beard‚Äù

*fans self* üòÖ

(Seriously though, this sounds like a really aesthetically satisfying routine!) Which components do you think have the greatest impact or could not be replaced by an alternative? Wondering if I could get some benefit without the full set. If you still get flare ups of the redness or if it's not completely resolved, try switching one of your cleansers for one without physical exfoliants. That might let things calm down the rest of the way. Everybody's skin is different but twice a day is a lot for most people, especially when dealing with redness. No sunscreen? I‚Äôm going to get that Violet-C Brightening serum. I‚Äôve almost pulled the trigger so many times. I know it‚Äôs what I need. Speaking as a guy who has combo skin (oily in summer, dry in winter) and fights redness as well this setup looks amazing and might want to emulate a similar setup! Currently I‚Äôm using also a super expensive Keilh‚Äôs calendula water cream to keep the redness at bay but if I deviate at all it seems to come back; Maybe Tatcha water cream might be a good alternative. I also have some dryness in my beard - do you find the Camelia Beauty Oil helps in this regard at all? Thanks for this awesome post shelfie! A healthy shine I like, but I feel you on the oil control. Took me a long time to find my combination for it too. However, I can‚Äôt seem to shake the red, and if this mugwort essence I have coming doesn‚Äôt help, I‚Äôd be willing to try some Tatcha. I was thinking of the Indigo cream, though I love my Hado Labo ‚Äî first gel I ever found that felt good and not greasy. What would you say helped with the red? That‚Äôs great! Just keep in mind that most 
Tatcha products have fragrance and flower extracts, which may cause contact dermatitis down the road (even if it‚Äôs been a year and you‚Äôre totally fine). You should try switching out the product you love the least with a fragrance-free and essential oil-free alternative. You could slowly repeat this process with the other products in your routine so your routine is less likely to work against your skin in the future (key word is slowly).

Edit: Why am I getting downvoted all of a sudden? Was it because I was glad someone found products that worked for them? Or was it because I gave advice supported by most dermatologists? Downvoting isn‚Äôt useful if you don‚Äôt explain what‚Äôs wrong. I'll have to look into this! Damn, I must be sleeping on QVC. Great tip The staff at Sephora were extremely helpful in diagnosing my issues and the product combo that would work. Apparently Tatcha sends trainers into the stores on a regular basis to educate them on the product line and what works for what. Try the balancing line for oily skin; green packaging it‚Äôs amazing! You can try my combination of severe depression + financial instability.

I don't recommend it. Really appreciate the tips, looking into this! Appreciate the tip, ordering now! Are skin care spatulas you can buy in bulk off amazon/eBay not the same thing? The Essence and The Water Cream TBH this is the only skincare routine I've ever had besides soap and water, but I do notice a big (negative) difference if I don't use it for a few days. I think they have a travel version that you could try out and see how it works for you. \*claps\* agreed! It's just not necessary! Let's just be excited for people for having a routine that they are proud of and is working! I'm sure it doesn't feel great for OP to be judged for their products, it's not fair. I wish my student loans were the price of skin care products üò≠ Give it a shot, takes like 20 seconds to apply. Think they have a travel version that makes it less of a financial commitment. It's pretty fucking amazing. And if you use it as recommended it lasts a year. What are your favorite alternatives for the Tatcha products? I‚Äôve been using protini for the past two years and just got a sample of the water cream. I personally like protini more because the water cream felt too light for me. If you find protini too heavy, then you might like the water cream more! If you have enough points and are a VIB member, you can redeem a sample of the water cream and cleanser at Sephora! That‚Äôs how I got my sample. water cream is very light, although i have oily skin and felt like it didn't sink in that nicely. same with Tidal from sunday riley - very similar feel. I haven't tried the protini, but the water cream is pretty light. I have a small container of the indigo cream that I use when I'm especially red in place of the water cream. It works very well for this. It's great, I apply it in the morning and don't need lip balm for the rest of the day. I'm in a fairly humid climate (Southern California). Doubt this would be the case in an arid climate. I was using the Leneige sleeping mask for a while, and while it was great for overnight, the Tatcha does just about the same with a far less sticky and thick formula. I use the Tatcha all the time now, day and night, and I *adore* it! Try Bag Balm. It's fantastic Tatcha‚Äôs Kissu lip mask point of differences from most other lip masks
1. No wax
2. Not only softens lips - it actually works to heal them üëÑ Agree! OP is not forcing people to buy these things. There will always be people wbo can afford more or afford less than we do. TBH I had no experience with skincare, and was extremely grateful that the sales rep at Sephora solved my problem so I continue to return to that Sephora and buy from that rep. I'm sure I could keep the oil and redness at bay with a different combo from other vendors but I enjoy supporting the people who've helped me. As I said in an earlier comment, once you have your collection it's not terribly expensive to maintain it as things run out. Oo! I was looking at those! If I were to only get one, should I get the toner, serum, or lotion? I love it, not goopy or messy if you use the spatula they give you. I could see it being goopy and messy without the spatula, perhaps. Not OP but I love silk canvas. It makes my makeup go on so smooth and it lasts longer than precious primers. Definitely the dewy skin cream. It is so nice. It feels like Tatcha puts a lot of thought into their product line. I have dry skin also. Unlike the OP, I don't really find that The Essence makes much of a difference for me. But Tatcha's moisturizer and sunscreen I find to be some of the best on the market for my skin type (dry/aging/somewhat sensitive). the water cream is nice, but it's light. see if your local sephora has sample packets they can give you to test out, everyone's skin is so different. The dewy cream! I have super picky dry skin and it responds really well to the dewy cream The dewy is DEF for dry skin. I am combo leaning dehydrated and it was too much for me still. My mom loves it though. I really enjoyed the indigo cream, which was a bit more oomph than the water cream, but not as much as the dewy. Dewy skin cream !!! I don't use the dewy skin cream, but I'd say the Luminous Dewy Night Concentrate is more hydrating than the Water Cream. This is purely anecdotal. I just like that it works. As mentioned in another comment, I'm sure I could find an effective combination from other vendors but Tatcha solved my problems so I'll stick with them. Like 500 dollars.

I bought 4 of the products in here and it's about 300 bucks. Yes, it's very light and once it's on you don't really think about it Notice the thirst upvotes anytime a relatively normal-looking man posts? Ha. I always supervise my GF when she's using my shelf. She thinks she needs way more than necessary. The great thing about Tatcha is that a little bit goes a long way! For the moderators:
Morning: Tatcha Deep Cleanse (I use this because it feels gentle and exfoliates), Tatcha The Essence (use this because my skin gets oily and red again after a few days of not using it), Tatcha Water Cream (use because it‚Äôs light and hydrating), Tatcha Silk Peony Eye Cream (use because it helps the bags under my eyes) , 3 Drops of Tatcha Camelia Beauty Oil in my beard (makes my beard glisten and hydrates the skin underneath)

Evening: Tatcha Rice Polish (use because it calms and exfoliates my face), Tatcha The Essence (use this because my skin gets oily and red again after a few days of not using it), Tatcha Violet-C Brightening Serum (use because It feels nourishing), Tatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Night Concentrate (use because it does a great job of hydrating and smells nice)

Top 3 products. These products are in my top 3 because I could likely only use these and would still be able to keep the oil slicks and redness at bay.

Deep Cleanse
Beautiful packaging with detailed ‚Äúbox within a box‚Äù and instructions on really nice paper. Easy to control the amount of product released from bottle.
Feels and smells light, ground luffa fruit fibers do a great job exfoliating
Positive effects are light feel and superb exfoliation
No negative effects
Does exactly what it says it does
Easy to use and does great job cleansing and exfoliating

The Essence
Same beautiful packaging with detailed ‚Äúbox within a box‚Äù and instructions on really nice paper. ‚ÄúDropper‚Äù makes it easy to control how much product comes out
Feels light and hydrating, my skin ‚Äúdrinks‚Äù it right up
Positive effects are excellent moisturizing properties
No negative effects
Does exactly what it says it does
Easy to apply, absorbs quickly and does its job

Water Cream
Same beautiful packaging with detailed ‚Äúbox within a box‚Äù and instructions on really nice paper. Golden spoon allows you to measure exactly how much you need.
Feels light and hydrating, once it‚Äôs absorbed you don‚Äôt really think about it being there.
Positive effects are effective hydration without promoting oil build up
No negative effects
Does exactly what it says it does
Easy to apply, absorbs quicky and does its job Step it up then sis Girl, this is such a sexist/trash comment. A lot of men have a lot of face products? Yeah im still too poor for this You don‚Äôt need to justify how you spend your money to other people. The people commenting about the expense are really rude. Use what you like! Tatcha makes great products that are a joy to use. I'm glad it works for you, I love hearing when people find a routine that works üòä What do you do for a living though? I‚Äôm still on the lookout for ideas How much is this shelfie worth, ya think? A $700 shelfie to be exact.. And that too a bougie brand like tatcha. Like, men know what that is?? Ugggh my husband never washes his face, never. He doesn‚Äôt put moisturizer on, nothing. Just sunscreen in the summer. And has the most perfect skin ever, it‚Äôs a beautiful perfect even tone and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs had a pimple since we met. üò° I would be livid! My girlfriend washes everything with dawn dish soap. My ex would use the dog shampoo if I left it in the shower after bathing the dogs. 

I have literally screamed. üëãüëã

Lol. Username possibly checks out. My husband uses bar soap to wash his face normally. When I got ipsy for awhile, he did use one of my face washes he liked so now I buy him that. He hates lotion or any type of product that makes him feel "goopy" or "slippery" lol. It's a process. But he is using facd wash now so we are on the right track. Only took me 6 years. yes for sure, a skincare routine should be gender neutral I think they might mean more korean skincare as in other types of asian skincare. Tatcha may be American but it's marketed as Japanese-inspired :) Tatcha is a Japanese brand - made and inspired.  The founder is an Asian American who went to Kyoto and healed her skin and her soul- she was inspired to create Tatcha using Japanese concepts for wellness.  She‚Äôs an amazing human- Vicky Tsai check her out ! I've had them in the past, but it was never a huge issue for me. The biggest problem I had was with the oilyness, the way the person at Sephora explained it to me was that once you give your skin what it needs it doesn't produce as much excess oil and it appears to be working. The redness was a secondary problem, but the routine has helped with this significantly. The Deep Cleanse product is good for this. I don't use it on the daily though, and a little goes a long way.

Also for the price people complain about the packaging, I just keep it upside down in the back of the shower. Yes!!!! I've tried so many other oil cleansers (cocokind, DHC,  boscia, mad hippie, dermalogica) and this is the best one of all!! Great question. I've noticed that when I go without the essence or water cream for a few days the oilyness/redness come right back. Yo bro! It's worth checking the water cream out, I think you can get the travel size without paying an arm and a leg. The Camelia Oil is the best beard oil I've ever used (even though it's not the intended purpose). It's helped me with dryness under the beard. My dad tried it and said the same thing. A bottle lasts me about a year using 3-4 drops a day, so it makes the cost less of a sting. I think the essence and water cream help most with the red, but when I'm especially red I use the indigo cream in place of the water cream and it works like a charm. That's a great tip, I'll give it a shot! An Estee Lauder serum gave me horrible contact dermititis followed by fungal acne. I think it's important to remember that price doesn't equal a good fit for all...but this is working for him, so I'd say leave this dude alone. lol QVC has such great deals in tatcha!! It‚Äôs literally buy 1 get 1 with some things, that‚Äôs how I tried the silk cream and I blew through it, it was so wonderful!! They have a beauty month where they have great deals, but you can catch good prices here and there, especially into the holiday season. I think it was 140 last year for the rice powder cleanser, eye cream, face cream and serum stick. It usually has essence in there but with covid they may not have been able to get the supply Oh yeah, the Q has awesome deals on Tatcha sets a few times a year. I think you can maybe sign up online for when they will be having shows, which is usually when they have the best deals. I found Tatcha prior to them airing on QVC (probably 8-9 years ago ‚Äî well before it was in Sephora, etc). They had some fabulous kits back when they first aired and kind of took off, but the line has expanded substantially, and I haven‚Äôt tried many of the newer products. Hopefully you‚Äôll score some good deals. üòä Everyone thinks ‚Äúold ladies buying random stuff they don‚Äôt need‚Äù when they think about QVC, but they have some awesome deals, especially on beauty. And they have WAY more brands on there than they used to. But BareMinerals, Tatcha, Smashbox, etc have all been on QVC, and some of the kits are great! Thats so cool!!! From Tatcha? I read this and literally throught I wrote it... Ariana said "retail therapy" and goddamn do I stand behind it. Oh and if you are looking for a tube container form lip balm to throw in the bag for outside use Jack Black is awesome! Also OP- you should be using a sunscreen- and the Tatcha‚Äôs sunscreen is perhaps my most favourite skincare product ever! I actually will splurge on the Essence and the sunscreen and then make up the rest of my routine with alternative products. But the sunscreen is amazing- you can‚Äôt see it and it blurs your skin like magic. I've been using a plastic knife as a spatula. Yes they are, really recommend if you wanna make any pot skin care feel nice and luxury, alongside make it easier to apply. But to be fair any plastic shape small enough works lol I may have to give it a go! Thanks! Yessss, agreed :) 

I was also thinking about how it is unfair for OP to be judged for their shelfie; I feel like sometimes people don't realize their comments come off as judgmental, but they totally do. Same. lol üò≠ I try not to think about it It prob will be if he uses it consistently for another 10 years or so Thank you :D Sold! Tell me you may take advantage of the Sephora sale with the gift sets? There are a ton. I love tatcha too and I‚Äôm trying to find some Korean skincare to incorporate but some things I‚Äôll stay with tatcha Let me suggest some other brands; the ordinary, Purito, Cosrx, Etude House. 

There is a whole subreddit for this: r/Asianbeauty Good idea. I'll redeem points for a sample. Thank you. Try the silk cream for normal skin or the dewy skin cream for drier skin both amazing!! I'll give it a try, thank you! I shop like that too. I know it‚Äôs their job to sell but you can also tell when someone is really passionate about the products and solving your problems. I return to the same people/products. That's fair enough, but the Sephora rep is not helping you out of the kindness of their heart, they're "helping" you because it's their job to sell you products. Because it seems like you don't mind the price tag, you enjoy the routine and it works for you then all's well that ends well! But just wanted to let you know you could be getting more for less (or even at a similar price point if you wanted, with brands like Skinceuticals) Hmmm it depends on what you need most out of a product right now. I do like the serum best because it has a few ingredients that the lotion doesn't have - namely hyaluronic acid and madecassoside, the later of which is very soothing. Plus I mix the serum with a different moisturizer at night and it mixes well. The toner is the consistency of water and feels refreshing and calming, but I wouldn't repurchase because I like a toner that moisturizes more and nothing can replace the Klairs Supple Preparation toner for me. I hope that helps :) Thank you! I normally am combo but recently have been getting dry patches around my mouth and nose, possibly due to either my pimple/black head spot treatments or the weather (there‚Äôs heavy snow where I am) Did you use it under your eyes too? Did you find that it was effective as an ‚Äúeye cream‚Äù? Since it‚Äôs so thick Wow, out of my alley, but what a great way to take care of yourself. Thank you for the info. Lol I better get a professional treatment with that money like laser resurfacing instead of skincare products that gonna have little to no effect on my skin Sure thing! They aren't rude, they're broke and wish they could join the fun! Lol. I'm currently laid off due to COVID so I had to switch to very basic skin care items. Really missing Drunk Elephant. Is tatcha that expensive? I mean compared to most skincare? I saw their starter kit was like $68. That‚Äôs not much at all compared to skinceuticals & BR, which I thought were the gold standard around here I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rude! And I don‚Äôt think a skin care shelf necessarily tells you how rich a person is anyway. Even when I was a broke student, I prioritized skin care. So my shelfie ‚Äúlooked‚Äù like a rich person‚Äôs even when I was living off tofu and ramen noodles. I make much better money now but actually spend less on skin care, since I was able to experiment over the years and find great quality products at a lower price point (thanks CeraVe!) Yeah, we do My father used foaming antibacterial hand soap as face wash for a year before my mom realized. His skin still looked fine. It‚Äôs not fair. Yeah I'm always like uhhhhhh do you know how spendy that shit is? Like way to make fun of me for how much I spend on my skincare then turn around and use my even more expensive shampoo on your face. Jenneiferlawrensokay.gif DISH SOAP? I‚Äôm so glad you pointed that out. üòÇ Lawd Cera Ve makes a bar soap! Maybe you can just switch it out and he won‚Äôt even notice lol My a/o has the same problem, says its too sticky for him and he doesn't like it, idk what to do about that, I love the feeling of feeling like a snail!! I started out thinking Tatcha was korean for sure. I knew Koreans who thought it was Korean. I think they market it as such, and think they might want to know. I was glad to know, I like it all right. I‚Äôm more apt to skip it because it‚Äôs now owned by Unilever. Wait could you go through your old routine before you got introduced to Tatcha products? And do you know if you have rosacea? I've heard a little goes a long way with all of tatcha's products so I'm not scoffing at the price like most people. I just want something that works for these annoying sebaceous filaments. Yeah, I use a pearl-sized amount and the big bottle of it lasts me almost a year. Adding origins to this list I think I‚Äôm gonna try a sample and see how it reacts with my skin! Even if I can‚Äôt use it every day, it looks like it would be great for emergencies. Thanks for your reply. For sure! Just don‚Äôt overwhelm your skin with new products (space each new one out by at least a month) because you don‚Äôt want to hurt the progress you‚Äôve already made!

Edit: Don‚Äôt downvote if you don‚Äôt want to explain what‚Äôs wrong. What does anything I said have to do with price? I‚Äôm just glad something worked for him because I‚Äôm sure lots of people on this sub spent lots of money without success in search of the right products.

And I never mentioned about Est√©e Lauder/luxury brands‚Äî most of their products have fragrance and color anyways. Yeah the have Lancer, Perricone, all the big names and the splitting of payments is the best. This is also where I found my love for IT cosmetics This is my mother buying all these packages from QVC ... AND SHE DONT NEED ANY OF IT. She has too much as it is Yes If you ever need someone to talk to reach out. We can get clear skin and through our dark days together‚ù§ Is it a chemical or mineral sunscreen? What is the spf? That IS better for the environment for sure ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pro tip: since it‚Äôs so expensive, ditch the cotton pads and just put it directly on to your face by slightly tipping the bottle. Or pour it into your palm and apply it with your fingers. Essences in general are kind of a more expensive product and cotton pads eat it up so easily since it‚Äôs a thinner product. This is what I do with all mine to save product lol No it's more like ten years of a brand new luxury car.. every year.. Yes the Tatcha sets at Sephora that contain the full size water cream or full size dewy skin cream are a HUGE value!  If you can buy during the upcoming promotion even better.  (You get the full size cream and for $4 more an eye cream and cleanser travel sizes )üî• Seconding Purito specifically. I have been very underwhelmed with the ordinary. Yup, back when I worked at victoria's secret ages ago I'd have my regular's that would only want my help lol. If you are actually a caring person people can sense that too I think. I work in sales myself, so I appreciate a respectful and consultative sales rep. Thanks for the info, maybe I'll check some other things out. Thank you!! I use almost all my moisturizers under my eyes because I get milia really easily from eye cream. If you mean indigo, if you just tried a tester, it might have gotten thicker from being out/age. Mine was creamier at the start of it's life than the end(\~1yr). Indigo didn't feel thick on either, it rubbed in to my skin well. Dewy didn't feel thick either, it has that nice almost gel cream texture, but it just didn't sink into my skin fully. I mean, you do you. Sometimes you need a little luxury in your life. For me, I spend my day covered in vomit and shit while getting screamed at by customers as well as my baby. 

If a couple hundred makes me feel good, I'mma do it.

In any case, precovid I spent that money on my hair, so it's actually cheaper to do the skincare since I don't need a new tub every 5-8 weeks. This. Nothing rude about it they are just telling the truth. I mean I couldn‚Äôt afford drunk elephant pre pandemic with my job. It‚Äôs all about perspective. I think this is a good perspective, but tell it to the SCA jerk people who got mad at the last tatcha routine post. People definitely get judgey at others for how they spend their disposable income. I'm glad there are basic options out there though!

In a perfect world, we'd seize the means of production *and* skincare. Sigh. They way they phrased it was definitely rude. And even if it is true, their finances aren‚Äôt relevant to this post at all- and people shouldn‚Äôt post comments like that. Your comment would be a much more appropriate one, because it is skin care relevant. I‚Äôm sure many people had to make changes due to finances, but to say nothing but ‚Äúthis called me poor‚Äù contributes nothing to the conversation and was made to make OP feel guilty and low key shamed. Yes, exactly! People have different priorities as spend money in different ways- and that is perfectly ok. There are good cheap products and there are good expensive products. This is a skin care sub not a finance one. Well we love to see it sir Gotta find him a face wash that is as easy to use as the shampoo is for him, Kerastase pricing is no joke! But it works soooo well.... Yep. It drives me insane. Lol good advice I will give that a try!! You must not have cats Lactic acid helps mine. I just use the ordinary Oh, same!! I have so many IT brushes from kits on there, and their brushes are some of my absolute favorites! Silken pore perfecting SPF is a chemical and physical sun block PA+++ which means broad spectrum protection - its for the person who hates the feel of sunblock - completely non greasy and feels amazing.  Has Japanese wild rose to keep the pores clear too! SPF 35. I believe it‚Äôs a combo but it‚Äôs mainly zinc oxide. That's what I do, it always goes directly on my hand from the bottle, then to my face. That's how the Sephora rep demonstrated it. I agree 100%, I've never applied it with a cotton pad. Straight into the palm and lightly rub it into my face. It absorbs fairly quickly. Couldn't imagine using a cotton pad, I'd be thinking about how much I was wasting the whole time. What are some of their products you‚Äôd recommend aside from the sunscreen? I‚Äôm excluding the sunscreen because it‚Äôs the one I see recommended the most so I already know it‚Äôs bomb lol I definitely find products a hit or miss. I really love a few products, and the rest are meh. I get what you mean but I still doubt if it‚Äôs worth spending that amount of money on one skincare brand like that, especially when you know there are a lot better and maybe cheaper thing you can get with that money I‚Äôm going copy/paste what I said to someone else.


They way they phrased it was definitely rude. And even if it is true, their finances aren‚Äôt relevant to this post at all- and people shouldn‚Äôt post comments like that. Comments should be skin care relevant. I‚Äôm sure many people had to make changes due to finances, but to say nothing but ‚Äúthis called me poor‚Äù contributes nothing to the conversation and was made to make OP feel guilty and low key shamed. Exactly, it‚Äôs really about priorities. As I‚Äôve gotten older my income has increased but so have my expenses, and I‚Äôm less interested in buying every  trendy product that catches my eye and more with developing a streamlined routine that makes my skin look consistently good. If I can find a product that works great for $10, why would I blow $50 on a fancy one that looks good on my shelf but does nothing for my face? But if the $50 product works way better, why would I skimp on a less effective $10 one? Everyone has different priorities, everyone‚Äôs skin has different needs, and you can‚Äôt really determine someone‚Äôs finances just by looking at a shelfie. If the expensive Tatcha routine is the only thing that clears up OP‚Äôs acne, I‚Äôm sure he finds it worth skipping a few meals out or other unnecessary splurges for great skin. Lmao thanks! Oh, he has his own. I buy him his own lol. "I like how this one feels" yeah because its infused with money probably. 

Kerastatse and olaplex are the only reasons I can be going back to blonde after having dark burgundy brown hair for the last 5 years. I won't even try any other brands because I know those two worrrrrrrk. In fact, I do :) Personal favorites so far are the Centella Unscented Serum and Cream, but I‚Äôm still working my way through trying their stuff. Honestly it‚Äôs incredible how cheap the serum is given how good it is, it‚Äôs a really excellent peptide/barrier repair/soothing serum. (The cream is great too, I‚Äôm just always sort of amazed by the serum, haha). Maybe not but it's my money.

I never said the products were good or bad or the best choice. I was just saying how much it costs and that I personally like them. I don't think its rude at all. It was funny and self deprecating. Y'all need to lighten up. Agreed. Does OP owe any of these people money? If not than they have zero reason to be judging how it‚Äôs  spent. It just comes off as snarky and jealous. [deleted] Team Olaplex over here. 

That would frustrate me to no end, maybe he needs to pay for it then? Lololol well I am a stay at home mom so he kind of does I guess

Olaplex is amazing. I got the new No. 0 sephora has and omgggggggg its amazing. Ooooh. That looks good. Have you tried No. 7? I like it more than the oil I was using from Kerastase! I havent yet!! Its on my list for my next round of beauty things. I have No. 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (haven't used it yet though) and have been very impressed with all of them so far. I use the blonde shampoo and the cinent anti-usure conditioner from kerastase. Ive never had any luck keeping my hair healthy when I lighten it but this time its stayed strong. It is flamazing! Can we be sisters so I can borrow your stuff?  How do you like the TLC Babyfacial? I have the Framboos and was thinking about trying that.  I am living for the pastel colored theme but also THANK YOU for your honest feedback on Glossier skin care. That brand just rubs me the wrong way and after their IG story bs, I don't feel the need to take them too seriously with their skin care. But I still really wanna try their cloud paint blush and boy brow lmao.  It‚Äôs it a true Shelfie if it doesn‚Äôt have the Ordinary, Drunk Elephannt, and Glossier. Thoughts on glossier? How do you feel about The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution?

I'm a noob and have been trying to work out how to put together a routine via the sidebar. That product is the one I was thinking of purchasing first.

I have dry skin and blemishes on my cheeks due to PCOS acne - I don't have any more breakouts after being put on the pill. Just blemishes (acne scars?) left and the odd, small spot. How do you like your Drunk Elephant products? How do you use your French Girl facial polish/how often? I have it too, but I hardly ever use it? Omg your collection is beautiful  This is beautiful. So much money in such a small cabinet, hah. I‚Äôm envious. I don‚Äôt even know what half of this does!!!  This is the dream. Jealous of how much stuff you have from The Ordinary. [deleted] This is my aesthetic. Just throw in some Fresh products and you‚Äôve got my ideal shelfie.  It's so pretty! üòç How do you feel about the Glossier Invisible shield? I was hearing some _really_ positive things about it for awhile, but then that kind of died out, plus i'm on an "as cheap as humanly possible while still being ok for my skin" kinda budget right now haha I have the French girl scrub and I HATE it! It‚Äôs so sharp, worse than st Ives lol. I threw it out after two uses. [deleted] How do you like the Framboos? And how many times you apply it?? As an Australian (whom cannot get a hold of Glossier locally), is the brand *that* good?  
For reference, I have dry/normal skin prone to hormonal acne.  It's... a pastelfie shelfie! :-) I like looking at peoples pics so I get to know products I otherwise wouldn'tve heard of. ..do you keep the TLC and C-firma bottles open like that 24/7?  You have good taste I mean same tbh üòÇ What a fine shelf!!!  OMG... this looks amazing! The ordinary have great INCIs, from what I've heard! What products from your shelf do you like most? Routine?? I'm from AB and almost all the products I use are AB products...but that French Girl Facial Polish piqued my interest!  It is so pretty!

I looked it up and found out it has rose in it!  How do you like it?  Does it have a strong rose scent (which would be amazing!)? 

Really nice organized shelf by the way...looks very pretty(: Skin care products and organizational goals.  Your shelf is 100% goals and I love the splash of colour those bottle caps are adding to the whole thing! Love love love :D ‚ù§Ô∏è TO I feel like I have my life together just by looking at this.  Is the Ordinary Glycol toner for acne marks and how well does it work? thoughts on TO‚Äôs Glycolic Acid? we have the exact same taste/shelves minus two. soulmates! how is the babyfacial?  I love glycolic acid. How is the ordinarys glycolic toner treating you?  Your thoughts on the glossier moisturizer and the priming moisturizer rich?

Edit: product name  I‚Äôm seriously drooling  Looks super neat but how do you survive with only one cleanser? I want the DE babyfacial so bad but we can't get it here in Canada because of silly restrictions!! Gorgeous shelfie Lol, shelfie So jealous! Im gonna save up for some Drunk Elephant!  How do you use the salicylic acid and the niacinamide?  Thoughts on the Glossier serums? This is all so beautiful and I want to buy it all love I have Glossier daily sunscreen and TO Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution too! But for brightening products I recommend Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate 3% from BFFECT because it‚Äôs not that sensitive but effective as well :) GIRL you got MONEY 
https://imgur.com/a/jDz0r Pretty but throw out all that glossier  Do any of those work? I'm not trying to hate, but I have a question? For all the money spent on skin care you could buy HGH and nix about 3/4 of that stuff, so my question is how many people on here use HGH, or have even considered it? [removed] [removed] Yes absolutely I like it a lot! To me, it‚Äôs more of an indulgence than an essential but it does make your skin so soft and smooth that you won‚Äôt want to stop touching it If you have a Sephora nearby, you can ask for a sample. My sample of Babyfacial lasted a month (one use per week), which allowed me to really test it out before purchasing.  Not OP but I used both TO version and the DE version and IMO the DE version is far superior for me at least.  My skin is super used to acids though, so perhaps the TO one is too weak.  Obviously there is a major major price difference so that is a consideration as well. However man the DE Babyfacial is a HG item for me. I use 1-2x a week, followed by a sheet mask and marula oil and the Aquaphor #sluglife ya know. My face frigging GLOWS the next day. Amazing. I love this shit. 

FWIW my skin is dry and sorta acne prone, but I was on Accutane for a year so its not really an issue any longer(also why I am now dry AF). Mostly my skin just is dry and gets flaky or sad looking, this makes it look luminousssss.  10/10  I like it, to be fair I'm a dude and my facial hair can sometimes get in the uncomfortable with heavier masques. What was their IG story bs?  I tried their boy brow and it‚Äôs super waxy-feeling‚Äî I‚Äôm a bigger fan of ABH‚Äôs clear brow gel imo  I LOVE THEIR CLOUD PAINTS!!!! Only thing I've tried from them that I actually liked haha they're so pretty and natural-looking. If you want to try a dupe for Boy Brow, I use the Essence ‚ÄúMake Me Brow‚Äù and I love it. It‚Äôs roughly $3 at Ulta! I‚Äôve tried the Boy Brow, and although it‚Äôs a great product - I just feel like it‚Äôs not worth the splurge.  The cloud paint blushes are seriously worth it. It‚Äôs the perfect, natural blush. I also really like their concealer.  > cloud paint blush and boy brow 

these are the two products that i LOVE, but i also want to move away from this brand and dont know where to find replacements for these guys. after trying and HATING milky jelly and seeing that insta story, ive decided that im over glossier. Since when is Glossier a must have for skin care? But they're all over Pinterest so they must be good right? /s Honestly there was a time when I was using all glossier products and didn‚Äôt realize how much they weren‚Äôt working for me. I would recommend only the cleanser and moisturizer, I like both of them and they are gentle and easy on my skin which is nice given that I use a lot of more active products I don‚Äôt have anything to add to the product reviews as I think they‚Äôre pretty spot on, but I want to add that their customer service is top notch. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of their sunscreen (stupidly bought it without reading the info and seeing it had a scent), inquired about a return, and they gave me a full refund without asking me to return it. Also, I recently bought another milky jelly cleanser (maybe my favorite skincare item from glossier) and inexplicably also received a new boy brow (in my shade) and a cloud paint in a color I didn‚Äôt have. Didn‚Äôt pay for either of them. Once again contacted customer service, assuming my order had gotten mixed up, and they told me not to worry and keep the extra product. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

Tl;dr if you do try something and hate it, it‚Äôs not a hassle to get a full refund. I was a big Glossier fan in the past but now I found my skincare favorites from them, which has been narrowed down to just the Face Wash, Skin Tint, Boy Brow and Balm Dotcom.

Priming moisturizer had terrible packaging and would leak everytime I use it. The face mist STUNG my eyes everytime I used it even if I shut my eyes closed tight. It had a nice smell though, but I prefer my Mario Badescu one.

Haloscope was a bit on the greasy side and has like no lasting power. Gen G had a decent formula but my lipstick cap cracked after a few weeks of traveling in my tote. I am so/so on the concealer because it blends so seamlessly but it does need to be set with powder. Greens Galaxy mask is one of my HG masks. On days where I‚Äôm breaking out hormonally or just feeling ruddy and blah, it makes my skin feel so refreshed and bright. Moon Mask is also decent, I continually repurchase it Their skincare stuff doesn't work for me (breaks me out) and is quite average otherwise IMO. Their make up is awesome and natural looking. I've loved every make up item I've bought (several lipsticks, highlighter, concealers, blushes, boy brow) and disliked/mehed every skincare item (cleanser, priming moisturizer, mask duo)  So personally, I started using the solution recently and it has caused a tiny bit of purging where I usually get acne. Not big bumps, just little ones that don‚Äôt bother me. I haven‚Äôt yet gotten to the point where those have completely cleared up, but I do think that the quality of my skin is a lot better. It definitely has brightened up some of my acne spots for sure, I would definitely recommend. I started using it about 3 weeks ago and also went through a little purge, but when I came out on the other side, it was glorious. It‚Äôs an essential for me now. I like to use it after moisturizer and prior to the TO granactive retinoid.  (i love your username) I‚Äôm a huge fan. I didn‚Äôt realize what I was missing until I tried them, and I was definitely reluctant to believe the hype, but it‚Äôs really that good! I was given it as a gift and I only use it on occasion, maybe once a week or so. I just dump a little pile into my hand and then squirt some cleanser on top, rub my hands together, and massage my skin like I normally do when I cleanse. I (and I think a lot of other people on this sub) am more of a fan of chemical exfoliation than physical, so I use the scrub sparingly, but it definitely is nice to do on sundays to treat yourself. Not OP, but this made me break out. The vitamin F (not actually a vitamin) comes from coconut oil so if coconut oil breaks you out, tread carefully You don‚Äôt need it! Regardless of your budget, it‚Äôs just ok. To some extent, I feel like sunscreen is sunscreen, and this one is light and feels nice, but it‚Äôs really not worth the money. They recently lowered the price and have been pushing it on social media because I think people came to realize that it‚Äôs just not worth it. Save that money and get some of that sweet sweet Neutrogena SPF, which I love Amazing! I love it. Definitely does its job well and to some extent keeps skin clear. Obviously it‚Äôs only an accessory type product, and you would get best results from an active that you can put all over, but it‚Äôs great for spot-treating and making sure that the pesky always-clogged pores stay clear Framboos is my favorite product that I use! It has cleared up my skin immeasurably. I use it once at night, layered underneath the marula oil Would also be keen to hear about this!  It‚Äôs obviously got great packaging and the stuff has good textures and smells nice. For acne, don‚Äôt bother. I have mild to medium acne and glossier never could make a dent in clearing up my skin. I do love the cleanser and moisturizers. Both are nice and simple and do their job well. Don‚Äôt worry! Kept them open for the picture, but no I do know to close them after use! I don‚Äôt even use those products and that was the first thing that came to mind. Yes! I thought I might be wasting seconds every day by opening and closing my DE products.  wait is that a bad thing because this morning in my half asleep & hungover routine i tried to yank the cap off instead of twisting üôà & after i put everything back together there is a tiny part of the pump that is still visible & won‚Äôt go all the way back down  Both my DE serums are amazing, I couldn‚Äôt choose which one I like more. I also really like the Glossier cleanser and TO n + z serum. Mario Badescu drying lotion is also really good, but since I‚Äôve been using drunk elephant I‚Äôm happy to report I don‚Äôt really have many zits that need drying AM
Cleanse with Milky Jelly, TO n+z serum, DE C-Firma serum, Glossier priming moisturizer 

PM
Cleanse with Milky Jelly, TO Glycolic Toner, DE Framboos, DE marula oil

Three or four times a week I use GM Collin deep cleansing solution at night after regular cleanser which I love, and I use DE babyfacial once a week or so.

Keep in mind that this is what works for me, and has turned my rubber, porous skin into a cloud of glowing porelessness

 Smell is not very strong but is definitely there. To me, it‚Äôs not as obviously rose and smells more like essential oils for some reason, which is great because I love the smell. Nice and rich, not too sweet or perfume-y The glycolic acid you mean? It works really well! Remember to use spf daily alongside it Priming moisturizer I use everyday. It‚Äôs nice and light, you can rub it in and your skin feels moisturized but also as if there‚Äôs nothing on it. The rich version smells incredible and is very moisturizing, so much so that it leaves a glossy finish on your skin when you first put it on. For me, it‚Äôs a bit too much, because that nice sheen can turn into a bit of an overly-shiny mask, but the moisturizer itself is nice and simple and gentle. In the morning after cleansing I use a small amount before my vitamin C serum  Definitely not worth the money, considering you can get way better ones from The Ordinary at half the price. They‚Äôre fine but won‚Äôt really make a big change in your skin What is HGH? I've had to remove your comment because it breaks Rule 1: Be kind and respectful.

EDIT:  Sigma Chi Alpha?   I might try The Ordinary‚Äôs version of this and see if my skin likes it before I spend 80 just to have my skin fall off lol! I just liked that this was a bit lower of an AHA %, the Ordinary‚Äôs is 30%.  But then I'll break out üò≠ Wow, you got a really generous sampler! I've been using the TO version and frankly, aside from some tingling, I don't see any difference. It's too bad that the DE Babyfacial isn't available in Canada (none of these products are, really...) but I think I will splurge on it next time I'm in the states. I WANT A GLOW. My skin has a weird texture post-acne... not scarring or anything and it's really mild... I can just tell it's not as nice as it used to be. Has this item had any noticeable effect on your skin texture? They posted an instagram story where they compared their new Glossier Solution to P50, Paula's Choice BHA, and Pixi Glow Tonic. They kind of presented the information in a misleading way intended to make their product look like the superior one, when the products mentioned on the story are arguably superior.  I straight up use a less than $10 brow mascara thing from cover girl. It‚Äôs great. As long as I maintain my eyebrows (shout-out to the benefit brow bar) it works really well.  I do feel like I‚Äôm seeing these three plus MB a lot recently. Or maybe it was just two idk. it‚Äôs what the cool kids use though They do have legitimately good products Thanks! Do you also use their makeup? You dropped this \ 
 *** 
 ^^To ^^prevent ^^any ^^more ^^lost ^^limbs ^^throughout ^^Reddit, ^^correctly ^^escape ^^the ^^arms ^^and ^^shoulders ^^by ^^typing ^^the ^^shrug ^^as ^^`¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø` I just started using this within the last week, and am also going through a purge phase too. Again, nothing crazy. Curious to see what it‚Äôll do for my skin in the long run but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve noticed a difference just yet. I would definitely recommend cleaner -> toner -> serums -> moisturizer.  Wait you use it after moisturizer!? Are you supposed to? Just asking because I use it before!  Ahh thank you! I‚Äôm a sucker for pretty packaging, so this has been tempting me for soooooo loooong. Thank you for an honest review!

Which Neutrogena one do you recommend? (And do you use it under makeup perchance?) Every night? Thank you! And any fragrance? Your shelfie might‚Äôve convinced me otherwise to pick up some more glossier stuff üòÖ  I'm not a fan of Deciem, but thanks for the feedback on the Glossier ones! Seems like they're a one-hit wonder with the cleanser [deleted] SCA was a great touch  [deleted] which product of The Ordinary's is comparable to Babyfacial? I'd totally rather try it out before splurging on the real thing! The ordinary also has a 8% percent version if I rmbr right I got lucky with some Sunday Riley samples at Sephora a little while ago. Asked for a sample of Good Genes, they pumped the sample clamshell completely full and then gave me some foils they had in the drawer. Lasted me more than two months. 

Worked, though- I saw results and then bought the full size $100+ bottle.  If you dig around in some of the drawers at Sephora you can find the sample containers and fill your own.  The TO version is great for removing cuticles fwiw. I use it on my feet for 20-30 minutes :)  So my acne was cystic, so it left those horrible rolling scars...I have been on Retin A .05% for a year now, that + sunscreen every day has seemed to do the most for it.  Chemical exfoliation in general has been a big help to me. I still have the scars, and may look into lasers or something when I can afford it.  But my skin def has improved texture wise with the Retin A and obviously always use sunscreen.  The DE Babyfacial has helped with the dullness I seem to be plagued with, and it makes my face so soft. 

I also want to find a Vit C I like but so far have not found one... It's laughable the claim that their solution is superior to P50. The amount of Sodium Hydroxide is pretty much caustic to skin.  I‚Äôve been wondering about the pixi glow tonic - have you used it and did you like it? If so what kind of skin do you have? I‚Äôm combo but starting to think my oil is coming from dehydration.  I recently converted to Elf brow products. They're like $2 and work so well that I can't justify buying expensive brow things anymore. Yeah I have some of their makeup. I have oily skin so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the concealer or skin tint, but I swear by their cloud paint blush, which is unbelievably pigmented and blends so well, and pretty much any lip product, especially the lip gloss. Boy brow is also amazing if you don‚Äôt need a lot of tint to tame your brows Not OP but tbh I've enjoyed all the makeup I've tried from glossier, I like their wash & priming moisturizer too but haven't tried any other skincare from them.  

Stretch Concealer: I've historically hated concealers & decided to stop purchasing them last summer.  However, this came in a bundle I purchased off MUE so I decided to try it since it was already her and I love it.  I don't use it for my under eyes so I can't speak to that, but I use it on my chin (problem area), and on my cheekbones to brighten them up.  It's not a 100% coverage concealer and it isn't matte so if you're looking for that I wouldn't recommend, but for my super dry skin it tones everything down & doesn't get cakey or dry mid day.  

Generation G is definitely more of a balm / stain than a lipstick and I only have one (Leo), but that stuff is effortlessly pretty.  It doesn't slide around or dry out your lips, and on me is shows up as a barely perceptible no brainer nude.  

Haloscope is the only one I've tried that I'm lukewarm on, I love the look / effect it has but the bulky white plastic container looks sharp for approximately 5 minutes, or until you touch it.  I'll probably de-pot it into something else before I'm done and if it doesn't mess it up I'll consider repurchasing because the formula really is that Dewey sheen ideal, but damn the packaging just kills it for me. 

Boy brow (how could I forget?) I really do love this, my natural brows are a good shape and density but the hair is so light they disappear on my face.  This corrects that without over correcting, it's easy, it's perfect for me.  

I think their makeup really is great for that natural wash look, but you don't have to be a cool girl natural model like most people talk about to enjoy it.  I consider myself average at best and their makeup does just enough to accentuate my natural features that I feel a little more pretty than plain.   I was also on the Glossier hype train until recently when I realized that not all of their products really worked for me. I do swear by their lip products, cloud paint, milky jelly cleanser, and boy brow! 

Other products I've tried..
- Priming moisturizer: works well in the summer for me, but not good enough for my skin the rest of the year. I live in the midwest. 
- Wowder: meh. Your face looks good right after you put it on, but it doesn't last long. 
- Stretch concealer: meh. I use it under my eyes sometimes. Not much staying power. 
- Skin tint: I only wear this when I need my skin to look just a bit better than usual, since I don't normally wear foundation. It evens out your skin tone, but it's subtle. 
- Body hero: Both the oil wash and the cream smell SO good but idk if it's worth the price. They don't make a huge difference for me. 
- Haloscope: It's a highlighter and it does the job, but I ended up not really using this very much...
- Invisible shield: I used this for a while, but it's not the strongest sunscreen and it always left my face feeling oily after the fact. I was relieved when I finished the bottle lol.  Good bot. it was always my understanding that you go from the most liquidy product to the thickest. so a toner should really be towards the beginning and a moisturizer should be towards the end. why put on a moisturizer if you're just going to wipe it off by putting on toner? I'm wondering this too 'cause based on my travels in the sidebar the product would be in the exfoliator category which in the example is before moisturiser... but maybe you can swap things about! It‚Äôs an active and a toner, so it should be used before. The only reason I can think of to use it after is if your skin is too sensitive, but I don‚Äôt think it would be as effective that way. I am so sorry, I totally meant after my CLEANSER. I was half asleep when writing this! Don‚Äôt reddit while tired I guess.  I switch between Neutrogena clear face and Elta MD clear, which is way more expensive but IMO worth it if you‚Äôre willing to splurge on sunscreen. When I wear it during the day (I‚Äôm guilty of forgetting during the winter) I generally will not wear anything over it. They‚Äôre both thick enough that you might not want to because it will feel too heavy I use it every night, but if your skin is sensitive I wouldn‚Äôt. I started off once every three nights, then two, so the transition was easier. Every other night will probably work just fine  Not OP, but priming moisturizer has a couple obscure flower and leaf extracts. I have not had any problems with it and any scented product (synthetic or natural fragrance) gives me  a reaction so I would say it‚Äôs safe in that respect!  Lol WTF Where do they have a mini size? Havent found one in sephora or DE website [This one! ](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-aha-30pct-bha-2pct-peeling-solution-30ml?redir=1)  I got good genes as a sample twice (just can't resist when I'm in Sephora) one time they pumped literally a sad baby pump, the next time it was filled up & I wanted to HUG the employee. With products like that a full sample can really give you a good idea on your compatibility with the product.  My Babyfacial sample only lasted 2 maybeee 3 uses, but at 1x/wk it's still worth trying out.  Yeah no. This isn‚Äôt good advice at all.  Well, I wouldnt recommend that at all, BUT, you could bring in an old one from home and use that if you really didnt want to ask anyone. Hah! This is kind of hilarious but also very useful to know. If I tired of using it on my face I will remember this. ;) Thank you! Completely agreed. Bad PR move on their part, and sadly it has misinformed a lot of people. I've gone through 2 bottles and so far I really like it! My skin is combo-oily and I used to use it twice a day, but I've had to reduce it to once at night only because the winter has made my skin drier than normal. I think it's a great product though; it keeps blackheads under control and it's fairly gentle. I love elf! It sounds weird but I love how ABH‚Äôs gel kinda makes my eyebrows stiff after using it- I‚Äôll definitely check out elf if their brow stuff does the same thing üòÇ Wow, I‚Äôll have to check them out! Thanks.  Yes! I have always LOVED Elf's brow products! I much prefer the 2$ wax/powder duo to the ABH dipbrow. But if you're a dipbrow fan Elf has a pomade (haven't tried). I do like the ABH powder but it's not worth it as the results are basically identical. Elf's brow pencils are awesome too, even the chubby guy. At 2$ I practically have one in all my bags, never know! The cloud paint is amazing. I feel like a tube of it is going to last me like two years because I can use such tiny amounts of it with great results. ooh glad to hear that about the Cloud paint!!! I'm absolutely stuck on which colors to buy... Love this. Thanks, guys. Been debating buying their products for ages.  Leo is the best!!!! It's my work go-to.

LOL I was really tired last night. Lesson learned, don‚Äôt reddit while half asleep!  You definitely can‚Äôt, I meant cleanser LOL. I was exhausted last night I guess. üò´ Hahaha it‚Äôs ok!! I just wanted to make sure, I was like oh NO I‚Äôve been doing it wrong!  Elta MD UV Clear was a game-changing item for me.  I work in derm and had been kicking myself for being unable to tolerate higher SPF products on my face because they always felt so goopy by the end of the day (oily skin type).  The rep for Elta came by and I splurged on it after feeling how light and silky it felt on my skin.  It doesn't break my face out and I feel more comfortable facing the sweltering southern summers with this stuff on.  Highly recommend this product!!  Have gotten several members of my family hooked on Elta sunscreens too. Thank you! ‚ô•Ô∏è I have it from a holiday duo with a mini marula. I got it to go along with "the littles" set to try everything out & I'm pretty bummed I'm nearing the end of all of them now =(  I agree it is more of an indulgence, but dangg it makes my skin SO smooth. Definitely try out TO first, I feel like if I never tried DE Babyfacial maybe I would've been content with TO. The only real differences for me were ease of application & product texture (TO being more liquidy/messy and DE being a more luxe cream) and my face felt a little tight from TO and not AS smooth where DE felt supple, smooth and glowy right off the bat.  Mind you, I only used TO twice before I started the DE but I'll be going back soon, hoping with continued use the results will be comparable as the price difference is so massive it's worth the effort.  Yeah it's crazy because part of me is like 'um okay you just gave me $10 worth of product, Sephora must have rules on how much they give as a sample' (I don't know if that's true but it seems like it should be) but joke's on me, because now I buy that $100+ product a few times a year from them. And you're right, especially with skincare it can take a few regular uses to see if you like it, if it works, if it reacts with your skin, etc. I do it all the time.  Good to know, thanks!  Ulta‚Äôs brow gel is the strongest, stiffest gel i have ever used and it‚Äôs only $7. I have really course curly brow hairs, and this is the only gel that has done anything for my brows As a counterpoint to OP, I find that the Cloud Paints look very pigmented out of the tube but blend out pretty sheer on my skin (NC30). Haze especially looks like a violent fuchsia upon first squeeze but blends out to a rosy pinkish color on my cheeks. It really will depend on your skin tone, but just keep in mind that it‚Äôs mega pigmented and bright, so whatever color you choose is the color that will show up on your cheeks. The darker colors, for example, are way too much for me, because they‚Äôre so pigmented I can barely blend them out to not look slightly clownish. My favorite is beam, the slightly peachy one My sister in law was a manager at sephora, at least at her store, there was no technical limit on the number you can give. They actually encouraged her to give them out bc that usually leads to more interaction/ inc likelihood of spending etc. She would always fill the shell up (unless it's a really small product and that would be a big chunk of it). The general rule was to feel out the customer, if they are actually interested in purchasing things vs comes in on their break everyday and asks for samples. I don't think I ever asked for one prior to this knowledge bc I felt so uncomfortable asking. But everyone, within reason of course, should take advantage!  Which totally makes it acceptable to do then, of course.  imma check it out! thank you so much!  I‚Äôm an NW25 and have the same experience with Haze (and I also have it in Beam). The first time I used it I put on way too much and was like oh lord, but now I have learned to put a tiny bit on my finger, then dab half of it on another finger on the other hand, then pat out one finger per cheek, if that makes any sense. It‚Äôs a method that has worked really well for me and I get pretty consistent results. I can build it up when I want a more dramatic look, but it‚Äôs definitely subtle enough for everyday.  I‚Äôm getting it when I have to order new cleanser! Gotta get that free shipping. [removed] [removed] Alright, I've removed this entire comment thread because it was getting nowhere.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Man honestly as an oily-skinned lady I used to looooove that dual action moisturizer, but I agree now that I take a medication that makes my skin more sensitive I can't tolerate it! not sure how to do an image and text together, so my apologies for the comment

here‚Äôs my thoughts on everything pictured:

\*\* note: all ratings are based on MY experience with the product

&#x200B;

BEFORE products (left to right)

* neutrogena hydro boost eye cream - i don‚Äôt think this really did much for me, and i‚Äôve also heard it has exactly the same formula as the moisturizer just more expensive 4/10
* neutrogena oil free acne wash - i have dry skin and mild acne, so this product really wasn‚Äôt for me at all. it made me so dry and i thought that‚Äôs what cleansers were supposed to do. 0/10
* clean & clear hydrating morning burst cleanser okay please don‚Äôt crucify me for this but i still actually like this cleanser, and i used it until very recently when i ran out and decided to switch to something different. it was never drying for me at all like some of the other morning burst cleansers supposedly are. it has fragrance but the fragrance smells really good and was never an issue for me. honestly... 8/10
* primark purifying tea tree & witch hazel toner - yeah again no idea why i bought this. it was really sticky and didnt do anything. 0/10
* clean & clear dual action moisturizer - this was wayyy to harsh for me. 2/10
* cerave facial moisturizing lotion - this product is really good and i used it until recently, it‚Äôs just not quite moisturizing enough for me but again i have dry skin so that‚Äôs not a surprise. 8/10
* blistex chapstick - it works fine but there‚Äôs better chapsticks out there. 7/10
* lush mask of magnaminty- i mean it smells good and didn‚Äôt hurt my skin? but it didn‚Äôt really do anything positive so 5/10.

not reviewed: pink lip gloss and red earth mask, lip gloss isn‚Äôt really skincare and i only used the mask once and don‚Äôt remember it too well

&#x200B;

AFTER products (left to right ish)

* cerave healing ointment - i use this a few times a week as an occlusive, mostly on my forehead and cheeks as they‚Äôre the driest. definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for something a little bit extra for moisture. 8/10
* aquaphor lip repair - i used this after i had an allergic reaction to a lip mask, and it helped my lips stay hydrated when they were like bright red and peeling. 10/10 honestly
* the ordinary hyaluronic acid - love it! i use it every morning to hydrate my skin, and it works, plus it‚Äôs inexpensive and absorbs well 8/10
* cerave eye repair cream - great inexpensive eye cream, i use it at night because i tend to get dark circles and i think it helps. 8/10
* the ordinary lactic acid - i use this 2x a week and i wake up so glowy! i used to use the glycolic toner and it was way too strong, so this is a good alternative. 9/10
* first aid beauty ultra repair cream - great am moisturizer, it‚Äôs not greasy at all but is still good for dry skin, which is definitely hard to find. 9/10
* the ordinary rose hip seed oil - this stuff is amazing for anyone with textured skin. it‚Äôs not greasy despite being an oil, and it absorbs really well overnight. 10/10
* garnier micellar water (pink cap) - great for removing makeup! i dont like to oil cleanse everyday which i‚Äôll explain in the review of my cleansing balm, but this is what i use when i‚Äôm wearing makeup and not going to oil cleanse. it removes makeup very easily for me but it does tend to sting my eyes, so definitely be careful. 8/10
* first aid beauty ultra repair hydra-firm sleeping cream - it‚Äôs definitely a little pricier than a typical moisturizer, but my dry skin loves it so it‚Äôs worth it for me! works really well with rose hip oil too! 10/10
* versed rich moisture cream - okay i know i have three moisturizers in this routine. but i use this one in the morning when my face is feeling more dry, especially on forehead / cheeks. i don‚Äôt use it for my whole face normally, because it can make my nose and chin a bit more greasy. i wrote a review of this on holy grail products, but since writing that my skin hasn‚Äôt been needing a product as rich as this every day. still, i love having this product around to use when my skin needs it, so it gets a 9/10
* krave beauty matcha hemp hydrating cleanser - i just switched over to this cleanser like a week ago, and i love it. i‚Äôve only been using it at night. it does lather up a little bit when you use it but that was actually something i wanted in a cleanser, because i‚Äôve tried several creamy ones that just really didn‚Äôt work for me at all. 10/10
* glow recipe papaya cleansing balm - really good cleansing balm! i only use this when i‚Äôm getting in the shower at night, if i‚Äôm showering in the morning or afternoon i use micellar water instead. i get that sounds a little random but i just think it‚Äôs easier to wash off a cleansing oil/balm in the shower. but it smells very nice, and leaves my skin soft. 10/10
* versed press reset gentle retinol serum - i‚Äôm probably not supposed to be using retinol because i‚Äôm too young, but sue me. this ones super gentle, but it‚Äôs made my skin a lot clearer after the initial purging. 10/10 from me
* neutrogena on the spot benzol peroxide - i‚Äôve had this like forever, it‚Äôs pretty inexpensive and it works. i use this on whiteheads and it brings redness way down. 9/10
* glossier balm dotcom - i like this for my lips, it‚Äôs a little thicker than the cerave healing ointment but both are petrolatum based. 8/10 because sometimes it will separate and liquid comes out? not sure why that is
* krave beauty the beet shield - best sunscreen ever, the last one i used was the purito centella one and imo this is better than that. it‚Äôs unscented but to me it still smells nice, it leaves your skin with a nice glowy finish (not oily though), it‚Äôs lightweight, etc etc etc. 11/10

EDIT to include required info

\- i have dry skin

\- skin concerns/goals are overall preventing dryness and dehydration, and i have natural freckles that i don't want to get rid of but do want to maintain Usually I don't like Garnier but that unscented micellar water is legit so good. I used to use the bioderma one but for half the price the Garnier is just as good Looking good! A tip that I discovered ‚Äì¬†the Neutrogena On the Spot treatment has the same ingredients as the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Leave-On Mask (don't let the "mask" in the name throw you), and with the latter you get much more product for the same price so it's a much better value. Oh my god I‚Äôm getting flashbacks from the clean & clear dual action moisturizerüò≠ THE DEVIL. Do you like the matcha cleanser better than cerave? I have Kraves kalelaluyah and great barrier relief lotion but I felt like they didn‚Äôt do much for me :( I like the neutrogena orange wash for my body acne. Does anyone have a product they like better? First Aid Beauty is my jam! The ultra repair cream has been a god send. I use it every morning and my skin feels amazing all day. And the Neutrogena spot corrector I use too! It is my favorite, clears anything right up. I love the clean and clear cleanser too, and I honestly don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs probably not the greatest, I wash the thing off so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ Can I ask how many uses you typically get out of the Beet Shield sunscreen? I also couldn't find what spf it is but I might just be missing it when I looked. I love the glow recipe cleansing balm but it broke me out so bad. I had to return it :( I love the beet shield! Love FAB!! * starts sweating bc I have CeraVe PM in my drawer* Clean and Clear products WRECK my skin I love krave beauty‚Äôs matcha cleanser and the beet shield ! I‚Äôm on my 3rd repurchase of each one ü•∫ From just looking at the before and after pictures the first thing I thought was ‚ÄúYes queen! Good for you. What an upgrade!‚Äù Great B&A shelfie :) ! Can you elaborate on why is clean & clear dual action moisturizer too harsh for your skin? How would I know what to use for myself? I Love that spot treatment. Target store brand is also formulated the same if not very similar! Great job! Thanks for all the descriptions and ratings .. and flashback inducing products ;)
And if it helps you feel better.. I heard a few podcasts on retinol recently and one expert says she recommends using it ‚Äúfrom cradle to the grave‚Äù. Like it‚Äôs excellent for preventive aging so best to start earlier than later! I love the krave matcha cleanser! A little goes a long way! Ive had mine since the middle of March, plus it hasn't made my skin dry or irritated at all. If you want a lush face mask that actually does something, try cosmetic warrior. It smells awful, almost rancid, because it‚Äôs garlic and tea tree. But I‚Äôll be damned if it doesn‚Äôt end my acne before it can even peak, and makes my face so smooth. Neutrogena oil free acne wash is my go to still to this day. I struggle with adult acne and it's the only thing that can tame breakouts. Other than that I am a kbeauty junkie. Healthy skin. Aww epic! Love Krave Beauty. Liah Yoo is awesome. I've just ordered Beet the Sun, so I'm hoping it's good :) The clean and clear is giving me some painful flashbacks This is such a great routine review, thank you! How do you incorporate your rose oil? Where did you buy the baby Cerave Healing Ointment? Looks like an overall upgrade! Thanks for sharing!! Really interested in the Balm Dotcom, with the upcoming winter time, and the Beet Shield Sunscreen! What's the best place to buy those products from? The glo up! That glow up i have the mask of magnaminty from lush, is it actually good for your skin? i bought it recently because the description said it helps with redness, but i haven‚Äôt really noticed many people talk about lush products here, or maybe i missed it Gotcha, thanks!! Also, how important is a lip scrub prior to the lip balm? Absolutely love this journey but you didn‚Äôt need to ditch the cerave pm- that‚Äôs my HG!! Love the skincare glow up! I was wondering which lactic acid is that? Is it the 5% or the 10%? I have the 10% and I‚Äôve been scared to use it after finding out there‚Äôs a 5% haha I have sensitive skin so I‚Äôm scared it might be too much Where did you find the FAB in a tube? I swear they only make it in the tubs now and I miss the tube version! Hey!did u go for TO lactic acid 5% or u directly jumped off to 10%? Have you ever watched Hyram on YouTube. He would approve so much I swear the dual action moisturizer is like 99% water. That shit does absolutely nothing for me. This is such a satisfying photo. I loooove that glow recipe cleansing balm ü•¥ü•¥ I‚Äôm sorry are some of the before pictures not that good? I‚Äôve had some good results with Cerave products like AM/PM and I love neutrogena‚Äôs hydro boost stuff. The rest I don‚Äôt use because I have dry/dehydrated skin. My upgraded routine looks almost identical! Such a good difference Did you change your geographical location? I hope you finished all that products waste before going out and buying all that new single use plastic. Lately I've noticed the Garnier micellar water drying out my skin.  Any suggestions for another brand?  I love the European Nivea MicellAir but it's not easy to find here. clean&clear is poison so much fucking plastic What do you use now instead? I've loved the dual action for years because it's great at not leaving residue and soaking in! When I was in my early/mid teens I lived for harsh products and average moisturizers lol. Dual action moisturizer and neutrogena daily moisturizer was it for me. I never had a big problem with acne just your usual hormonal pimples but I was using that clean n clear benzoyl peroxide cream cleanser twice a day. My skin today cringes! I use it too and mix it with a few drops of hyaluronic acid and it does wonders for my oily ass skin. That and youth to the people cleanser The dual action made me break out a lot I love the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Hydra-Firm Night Cream! I was allergic to the regular Ultra Repair Cream unfortunately but the night cream works great for my skin. For the Balm Dot Com you have, throw it in the fridge for a little bit (30 min.) and you're set! I've done this with my Birthday BDC and Coconut  BDC and it's worked for me! I love the neutrogena face wash as salicylic acid mask. What was the initial purging of the retinol serum? Just a quick question for you (sorry I tried zooming in), are you using the 10% or 5% Lactic Acid formula from TO? Curious since I feel the Glycolic Acid Toner just doesn't quite agree with me or is maybe just a bit strong on my rather sensitive skin, and you liking the Lactic more as an alternative. Sorry I‚Äôve never heard the term maintain used for freckles? I‚Äôm curious what that means! Is it just keeping the amount you have without sun exposure? I also have freckles and I have no interest in getting rid of them and I actually don‚Äôt mind when I accidentally expose my face to the sun and get more (but I know many people don‚Äôt like their freckles). Been looking for a new sunscreen, just ordered one of your Krave ones and love their option for carbon neutral shipping. Giving ratings for products that just weren't made for your type of skin doesn't make much sense. Question, I know you aren't a derm or a professional but in your personal opinion/experience do you think it's worth it to get hyaluronic acid as a stand alone product even if your other skin products contain it? Each morning I already use Cerave vitamin C and their ultralight moisturizing lotion with sunscreen. Just a question for the Krave sunscreen; what is the actual ingredient that has an SPF rating? Because I looked at the ingredients list and couldn't recognize anything and I also noticed the website never said "sun protection" or "sunscreen" specifically, just that it protects from sun damage, but I also didn't see an SPF rating. I'm wondering if I'm just missing something? I have skin similar to yours so I'd love a good sunscreen recommendation! [deleted] i know right! it‚Äôs my first micellar water and i feel like i got so lucky. have you noticed it stinging your eyes at all? because i know i definitely have to be careful with it, not sure if that‚Äôs just me though lol Yeah i was incredibly surprised at how much i like it Second this. I'm usually pretty sus when it comes to Garnier but this micellar water is a staple for me. Excellent dupe for Bioderma and less than half the price. wow i did not know that, thank you so much! i‚Äôll try that whenever i go to repurchase this one Real MVP hahahahaha! it was my first ever moisturizer, kind of nostalgic for me I can somehow still remember the smell of these things! I haven‚Äôt even used any in forever i tried both the cerave hydrating cleanser and the cerave cream to foam hydrating cleanser, and i can definitely say i like this one better! i haven‚Äôt tried the kale lalu yaha or the great barrier relief though, so i can‚Äôt speak for those :( Much prefer the matcha cleanser. My face feels cleaner and I think it helps with redness as well. It also has lasted me 6 months for real. I used Murad acne body wash last year for my back acne and it actually worked. I‚Äôm back acne free now ;) you could try the cerave sa cleanser! i know it‚Äôs difficult to find right now though I use the one that they market as a body wash, which now that I think of it is likely the exact same thing in a different package. i definitely got lucky with the spot treatment, i believe it was actually something my mom got me in middle school whenever i first started to get acne, and i‚Äôve just been using it ever since! exactly! i know people on here don‚Äôt love fragrance, but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôll be on my face for more than a minute so it was never a problem at all for me. I use it once a day and it takes me about ~6 months to finish a bottle! And the SPF is 50+ oh sorry about that, have you found one that‚Äôs better for your skin? I almost ordered the Glow Recipe Cleansing Balm but didn‚Äôt because of the Sorbitan Oleate. That could be what causes your breakouts. I ended up getting the Then I Met You Balm which I‚Äôve used for about 2 weeks and it‚Äôs great. I probably looked at the ingredient list of 40 different products before making that purchase (it is rather expensive) but it was worth it. Hope that helps! But did you like the experience using it? I got and my first impression so far is that when I want to take if off it doesn't emulsify properly and leaves a oil layer on my skin (not the good kind). Most of cleansing balms/oils I used it almost felt like the 2nd step cleansing was optional (although I always went with a gel cleanser after), this one I had to repeat the 2nd step cleansing. Me too it‚Äôs my holy grail sunscreen!! i still like that! it was one of the good products i used back then lol it‚Äôs my first time using them both, but i love them so far and i can definitely see myself repurchasing! Just purchased the beet shield! Do you mind me asking how long it lasts/how frequently you apply? thank you!!! yes i can! i have pretty dry skin naturally, and it‚Äôs a lightweight moisturizer that also has salicylic acid. i use heavier moisturizers now that don‚Äôt have any actives, and that‚Äôs what my skin seems to like better. to be honest, it took me a lot of trial and error. the best advice i‚Äôve heard is to start with the basics (a cleanser moisturizer and sunscreen that are good for your skin type) and then add other products as they seem necessary! i hope this helps :) glad you liked it! i‚Äôm glad it works for you! it was just a little too drying on my skin, but i also have dry skin so that is a consistent problem for me thank you so much! it‚Äôs my first post about products and my routine, so i wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to write and it actually got removed my first try üòÇ i use it over moisturizer at night, and i put about three drops in my palm and then rub it between my hands, and then pat it all over my face! i use it pretty much every night, and if i‚Äôm going to use the cerave healing ointment i put rose oil between moisturizer and the healing ointment. hope this helps :) ulta! they were out of the big size, so i got the two pack of small ones thank you! Not OP but you can get the Balm Dotcom from the Glossier website. Pretty sure Glossier ships to US, Canada, UK, Ireland, France, Sweden, & Denmark (according to their website)?? I love the rose scented one but looking for a dupe. I know it's basically Aquaphor but they just smell so dang good. i personally bought them from the glossier website. as for the beet shield sunscreen, i definitely recommend you give it a try whenever you finish the one you‚Äôre currently using, i can personally say it‚Äôs the best spf i‚Äôve used so far! thank you! glad you enjoyed :) I used to use it all the time when I struggled with acne and I remember really liking it! Considering getting it again Lush is a very ethical company... with not very many great products.  Plus, they're all packed with fragrance.  Not that you shouldn't use them personally -- if they work for you, great!  But... they're not going to be safe and effective for as many people as, say, Cerave, Krave (also very ethical!), FAB, or The Ordinary.  That's why you see more people talking about those brands than about Lush. i personally liked using it, but for me it was more of a fun product to have. it didn‚Äôt harm my skin at all though, so if you have it and it works for you that‚Äôs great! i dont personally use a lip scrub, but that‚Äôs up to you! i do actually still like that product! i still use it in the summer sometimes when my skin is more normal, but i‚Äôm just too dry during the rest of the year üòÇ it‚Äôs the 10% ! i have never had a problem with it, but my skin isn‚Äôt especially sensitive so if you find your skin burning or getting red after using it you could try the 5%. hope that helps! i believe i got it off of sephora? it was listed as the same product as the tub, but there was different sizes offered. i hope that helps! i actually went down in strength from using the glycolic toning solution, because it was too strong for me. if you don‚Äôt have sensitive skin, i think the 10% is okay to start with! i love hyram! me too, definitely too light for me hahah thanks! i tried to recreate the first photo with the current one so it would be an easier comparison me too! it liquifies so well ahhh i still like the cerave pm and clean and clear cleanser! the only reason i have mixed thoughts on the eye cream is it has a formula incredibly similar to the hydro boost moisturizer, so i would just get that instead and save some $$$ definitely! my skin is a lot healthier now :) nope! it‚Äôs actually the same bathroom counter in both, but we repainted in between so it‚Äôs a different color wall i actually did try to be conscious of this! everything that was okay on my skin, like the clean&clear cleanser and the cerave moisturizer i finished, and other products that didn‚Äôt work for my face, i used on my body (the products with salicylic acid were good for that) Do you wash your face after using the micelles water? i only stopped using the cleanser like two weeks ago üò∂ like you‚Äôre so perfect...? this is over a year I‚Äôm not OP/commenter you‚Äôre responding to but CeraVe PM moisturizer has a very similar lightweight formula without the irritating fragrance and menthol (I also think salicylic acid makes no sense in a moisturizer) I still use it to this day... since high school.... In the 90süò¨.

I have never found a moisturizer of this type that my skin likes, other than this. And it works. Now I use the Naturie Hatomugi Skin Conditioning Gel. It's a super lightweight moisturizer gel that also sinks in really nicely. BUT if the dual action is working for you stick with it! If my skin hadn't changed I would have I was also allergic to the ultra repair cream, but I was curious about this since I need a heavier cream for winter and I really like the FAB moisturizer (not cream) during the summer I third/fourth this comment! I do like the regular ultra repair cream but a little of the hydra firm night cream goes a LONG way. It‚Äôs sooo hydrating and I keep it in my fridge before using it at night! It doesn‚Äôt feel heavy on, and is extremely moisturizing.
I love it when my night creams are cold, you should try it  :) thank you, i‚Äôll try this! for me i tend to break out on my nose and chin, and this gave me a few deeper breakouts that eventually came to a head. i‚Äôd say i started purging about 2-3 weeks in and it only lasted 2 weeks total. i hope this helps! It looks like 10% to me 10% ! the glycolic made my skin really red and bumpy for some reason? but i actually tried using it for kp on my arms as an alternative use and it has worked very well for that i have a lot of freckles, and i have them year round but they can get a lot darker in the summer, especially because i spend a lot of time outdoors! by maintain i meant like get them to be how they usually look in the fall/winter/spring months, a little lighter but not gone, if that makes sense! i love that they have that option! totally was worth the extra dollar for me :) i was hoping i could help people with a similar skin type to me, but i totally get where you‚Äôre coming from! (definitely not at all a professional!!) i think it depends on what you want from your routine, i added it when despite using other products with hyaluronic acid included, my skin was still a bit dehydrated. 

it‚Äôs definitely not something necessary for a routine, so if what you have right now is working for you then i would stick with that! the way i understand it, it uses spf filters that aren‚Äôt approved in the US by the FDA yet (it was designed in Korea), so it can‚Äôt use the spf rating when selling here. that being said, it has an spf of 50+ and a pa rating of pa++++. the filters are: 
- uvinul a plus 
- tinosorb s 
- octyl triazone
- amiloxate 
- polysilicone-15

the version sold outside of the us is called ‚Äúbeet the sun‚Äù, so if you want to look more into it try that name! i believe they also have an explanation on kravebeauty‚Äôs website. i hope this helps!! There's a difference between rosehip seed oil and other rose products (e.g. rosewater sprays and whatnot).  Rosehip seed oil doesn't smell pleasant -- kinda weird, actually. I haven't noticed any stinging, but I don't wear eye makeup so at most the only thing I'm removing from my eye area is just under eye concealer. I use the Simple Micellar water and it works great and it‚Äôs very gentle and doesn‚Äôt sting my eyes and I also have very dry/ sensitive skin if you maybe wanted to try something that doesn‚Äôt sting your eyes. Also that you for your review of the Glow Recipe Papaya cleansing balm! I have really wanted to try it but it‚Äôs a little pricey and I‚Äôve already wasted a lot of money on skincare that hasn‚Äôt worked so I might just go ahead and splurge on it now! Do you think the CeraVe Cream to Foam cleanser leaves your skin drier than the Matcha one? This is super helpful! I thought it seemed expensive but for that kind of use, that's actually fairly cheap. I think I'm gonna give it a try, thank you so much. :) No I went back to micellar water. This ingredient list had almost no acne prone ingredients compared to most cleansing balms so maybe I'm just not meant to use them I apply it once a day everyday, and I think it lasts me about 6 months for one bottle! I know the bottle looks pretty small but (for me at least) it definitely lasted longer than expected

Edit: I should mention that I only use this sunscreen for my face- I use a different one for my neck. So that probably also affects how much of the beet shield I apply everyday Thank you that‚Äôs good advice I use those so I guess am not too bad hehe Yeah same, I use it year round mixed with oil but that‚Äôs my final layer on top of layers of various toners and sometimes a gel moisturizer thank you! will try it out this week to see how it works with my skin :-) No, I do not feel the need to.  Do you recommend cleansing after? I have to say tho. The clean and clear works for my face. Leaves it smooth and my pimples go away in a day or two. >I also think salicylic acid makes no sense in a moisturizer

Why not? Is there that much of a difference between that and using a leave-on salicylic acid product (like the PC BHA liquid) and a separate moisturizer? Thank you! Ultra Repair Cream contains essential oils which I am sensitive to unfortunately, whereas the night cream doesn‚Äôt. It was a bit heavy for me in the summer but now that it‚Äôs fall and the temperature has dropped, it is the perfect consistency for me even in the daytime. It's weird because it's not recommended to put lip balms in  the fridge, but you need to with these every so often. I'm ok with it because I have a skincare fridge, but when I first did this (without my skincare fridge) my parents questioned me for having my lip balm in our normal refrigerator. Thank you so much! I may give this a try Thank you :) Thank you for the info. :) Fortunately I didn't have a bad reaction like you, more so slight irritation and it causes dryness that can't be countered by anything, so I know my skin doesn't like it. Good idea too btw, I'll use it up on my arms and legs, thanks again. Thanks! in my opinion it smells like peanuts or peanut oil üò≥ i will definitely give it a try once i‚Äôve finished the garnier! The Garnier stung my eyes.  Simple didn't. yeah it definitely did Seems like you‚Äôre not putting sunscreen enough. We should put around 1/2 of a teaspoon for the face and neck to get the full coverage of the sunscreens SPF. ‚ÄúA little goes a long way.‚Äù does not apply with sunscreen. Ya so I read a paper somewhere that stated you‚Äôre supposed to wash your face afterwards because the micelles trap the particles but if you don‚Äôt wash it off, the gunk still stays on your face. yeah mine too, and i know it‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù but i love the scent of it ‚úåÔ∏è Because most people don‚Äôt want to be chemically exfoliating their sensitive skin that they‚Äôre trying to moisturize daily, and definitely not in some areas. Fair point. BHA‚Äôs just tend to be somewhat drying, so I‚Äôve always found it somewhat counterintuitive to try and make a dual action moisturizing/exfoliating product. I‚Äôd rather use two dedicated products for two distinct purposes. I've honestly never heard of anyone having a skincare fridge. I added to my comment above but I do use a different sunscreen for my neck, so that‚Äôs probably why I use less of the beet shield with each use I've been using micellar for a long time without washing it off.  I'll try rinsing it off and see if I notice an improvement. Thanks! Right, I'm not saying it should be your everyday moisturizer, nor is it appropriate for sensitive skin. But it's an option that someone has if they were going to use a leave-on salicylic product anyway. I guess, but as long as it's not the only option you have for a moisturizer, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to have around. (Not speaking about this specific product, which I don't know much about; just about the concept of dual action things in general.) The one I have isn't a really high end one (it's more meant for your car, but you can have it in your house) but it made me more organized just because I'd have all my skincare stuff strewn around my room. It's mainly to help more organic products (think Lush) from going bad. I also just keep most of my stuff in there because it feels a little nicer cold. It's also much easier to control the amount of each thing to get the result you want if they're separate. There are certain parts of my face that need way more acids and parts that only need moisture, and I want to be able to target each concern to even them out. 

I used to use that product too, back when I was afraid of moisturizers‚ÄîI find it's kind of like a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner. It *sorta* does both things, but it does neither one very well. I get what you're saying, but at the same time, you can still target those places by using the dual-action moisturizer in one place and the regular moisturizer in another. Using a separate SA leave-on product is better because it lets you use a consistent moisturizer all over, but they're not quite as easy to find in drugstores, at least not until fairly recently. Totally true, and the moisturizing part may even act as a buffer if you have sensitive skin. And you're absolutely right; the only "spot treatments" available for so long were fuckin benzoyl peroxide and NOTHING ELSE. (If only I had known about tea tree when I was 14 man...)

Thing is, this kind of product targets someone who doesn't WANT a multi-step routine ;) I remember having to explain why 2-in-1 shampoo wasn't good to my guy friends in college‚Äînamely, you're asking one product to perform two contradictory functions. It's okay if you understand what it's actually doing and compensate accordingly, but you can't expect miracles from a single product. 23 / M / oily skin (indian background) living in melbourne, aus

from left to right:

1. Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion: cheaper than PM, similar ingredients

2. Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser: again, affordable and effective, comes in a big 350mL bottle like the moisturizer above

3. Dickinson's Witch Hazel: i like this in the morning or after i've shaved. i feel like it helps to soothe areas that are otherwise irritated or inflamed and AFAIK the anti-bacterial properties are good for acne, although to be quite frank, of all the items in my bathroom this is the only one with the potential of being placebo haha

4. SunSense Sensitive Invisible SPF 50: usually my body sunscreen, it's a little bit heavier than I'd like for face sunscreen, but i'm going to be in Jakarta and Mumbai for a while and La Roche Posay is too expensive for the amount I'm going to be applying daily lol

and most importantly, the bottles are from Miniso, a Japanese affordable homewares brand that's popped up recently in Melbourne. these vacuum bottles are 80mL so comfortably within the carry on limit, AU$4 each (they have the little vacuum pump so you can get every last bit of product) but they have regular non-vacuum bottles for $2 each. i printed the labels on regular paper (font: Consolas) and just sticky taped them on ‚úåÔ∏è

only regular part of my routine that's not pictured are Stridex pads that I use nightly, but there's no point repackaging those

edit: added bottle size Where did you get the bottles? Friendly PSA: You should keep your sunscreen in an opaque bottle, otherwise the UV will break down the active ingredients and decrease its effectiveness! You can wrap the bottle in aluminium foil, or even paint it with a few coats of nail polish if you want something prettier.  

&nbsp;

*Edit: this hold true for many other ingredients (especially actives), so make sure to check your ingredients and how they react to UV exposure. Or just stick to opaque bottles to always be on the safe side :)  this is so aesthetically pleasing üôèüôè All my travel sized containers are random re-purpose bottles! They are eco friendly bc u reuse the containers before recycling.. but they don't match all nice!!!  Beautiful! More people should do this instead of carrying heavy oversized bottles around.

I'd also like to know where you bought these ones, since they're really nice, but you can find similar bottles anywhere, here's a bunch from Amazon:

[https://www.amazon.com/slp/100ml-plastic-bottle/x9k6ygk9x8qbfan](https://www.amazon.com/slp/100ml-plastic-bottle/x9k6ygk9x8qbfan)

Get the ones that are max 100ml in size since that's pretty standard for airports around the world, then you can have your products in your carry-on bag if you like. Now I want a label maker This is my kink You should keep the products you buy in their original containers. This is how the packaging compatibility studies have been conducted and it‚Äôs the only way you can ensure proper shelf life. Also, sunscreen can melt certain types of plastic and it can leech into your product. Not safe.  [deleted] Word of caution, my spray cracked I‚Äôm assuming from the additional pressure in the sky? What does a toner do? Nice travel bottles. I hate that TSA only allows a quart size bag for liquid toiletries. Even if you transfer skincare products into little containers, there‚Äôs still hair care too lol.  Not a great option to have clear packaging in your skin care. Active ingredients may deteriorate in contact with light  I feel your pain. Going minimal like this is positively Soviet. But it looks really slick! Well done!

&#x200B;

When you come home, give yo'self ALL THE EXTRA.  Minimalist hell - love it! üòÇüòÇ I recognize those bottles, from MINISO right? I just bought some for my purse bottle of moisturizer. They say they're vacuum bottles but so far I've had trouble getting it to work right. I'll have to see how it works halfway empty. This photo is clearer than my skin Hi! Where did you get the bottles?
Have a nice day :-) Lmao! Yes that‚Äôs what I meant to say, I was heart broken too because I ended up losing all my precious toner! That looks so nice Are these types o bottles easy to refill ? :o How did you refill these bottles?  Any idea on if these will work with a thick overnight cream? I feel inspired! Thanks everyone! I didn‚Äôt even think about the product protection aspect.  This might be a dumb question but would you be able to put micellar water in one of these? Or shampoo and conditioner?  Thanks!! Some facial products need to be in dark containers.  this is such a good idea fellow organizer i just got back from my own and godspeed friend!  I‚Äôm heading to India in a couple of weeks and was looking for a travel-friendly option for my products; thank you OP! 

PS- minimalistic hell, yes, but aesthetically pleasing to the eye nonetheless üòä The ironicism of a "minimalist" 4 step skincare routine Please remember to care for the environment. The less empty (or full) bottles we buy the better. Why don't you just use a small amount of glad wrap or honey bee natural wrap on your existing bottles to make sure they don't spill out and take them. Usually they aren't overly large  I would ditch the toner. I wash my face, I moisturize, and I use SPF. That's pretty much it these days.  Miniso is amazing! I stumbled on their store in Hanoi recently and was gutted to find they don't seem to ship to most places in Europe or North America, except for the limited selection they have on Amazon. Their stationery is great, too.

Also, your post inspired me to look at their Wikipedia page, which says they're actually Chinese, but lean so hard on their faux-Japanese branding that it brings them criticism in China for false advertising. TIL

Nice work on the bottles, btw! Thank you for including the font üòÇ That is the detail we were all waiting to hear Just so you know, Miniso is a Chinese company that masquerades as Japanese. I would probably avoid their skincare and makeup because of that BUT they are still perfect for things like the airless pulp bottles you bought and other little useful items for cheap For the Stridex pads, [BlenderBottle makes a perfect travel container.](https://www.blenderbottle.com/products/gostak)  They seal perfectly so they never end up dried out.  And their shape is so much easier to fit into tiny travel bags. Ah you're in Oz! Where do you buy your CeraVe products? I've checked all the chemists in my area with no luck. Living in India, and have to agree that Miniso is great. Their stores popped up about a year ago here. I have the exact same bottle from Miniso! I transfer my moisturizer that comes in jar packaging in the bottle. I hate jar packaging cos they are so gross. These pump dispensers are awesome!  If your stridex tub has already been opened, I would use something to repackage. Mine leaked in my suitcase when I brought it home from the US. That's my favorite font! Which specific la roche posay sunscreen do you use?  Your first 3 steps are exactly the same as my routine. Read a lot about how good witch hazel is but I'm not sure I have seen any results from it... Still using it though. Might look for a different toner next time. Can you get cerave in Australia? All I would say is that if you can avoid buying additional plastic bottles or promoting their use it would be a lot better for the environment. I don't think those bottles are so large that they require buying new bottles for. U Punjabi bro? Ebay has plenty of them, search "airless pump". I think I saw even the exact ones like op's. Just found some on amazon too so here‚Äôs the link if you‚Äôre interested! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BQR5SLB/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_3JteCb8Z6T6NT Miniso. Also MUJI!  I thought the exact same thing! Please think about the environment before needlessly buying additional plastic. this is a really good point and something that did occur to me! in the end i decided that since they'll be spending 99% of the time zipped inside an opaque toiletries bag, i should be okay, but it's something i will be careful about. thanks for the heads up üòÄ This should only matter if you let the sun touch them. Most hotel bathrooms have no windows, so this should be impossible. > All my travel sized containers are random re-purpose bottles!

Mine too! I generally find it really tough, to find well-made travel bottles, but the luxury brands spend a bunch of money on their 'mini' sizes, so I repurpose those.

I was at my mom's house for thanksgiving. I went through the drawers in her bathroom, and pulled about about a dozen samples she had, that had long since expired. I cleaned em out, and two of them are really just fantastic for carrying enough cleanser for long trips. some packing tape and paper could temporarily suffice, if you had to wait on a label maker.
source: op used paper and tape but label makers are mor There are lids you can buy with pumps on Amazon. Some places carry Cerave in the tub with a pump. 

If you don't want a pump, maybe a squeezable tube like GoToobs. There are lots of options on Amazon.  I poured it into this bottle from Muji: https://www.muji.us/store/pet-rectangular-pump-bottle-600ml-white-1.html. I looked around for bottles that were nice and minimalist looking, and Muji's were the nicest.

Bear in mind, decanting CeraVe in the tub into a bottle is messy business. But definitely worth it in the end! > Can anyone recommend a container for Cerave in the tub so I don't have to tip my fingers or a spatula in the jar?

Are you looking for a travel sized container? Or just an alternative to the tub?

If you want a TSA compliant container, depending on how often you travel, CeraVe actually makes the creme 1.75 oz size. If you are using the creme in the tub with SA, then they sell a 3 oz size of that, but they label it a foot creme, for some reason.

If you just want an alternative to constantly dipping fingers/spatula into the tub, then CeraVe sells the tubs with a pump. OH yikes. didn't think about this at all (surely you mean reduced pressure at high altitude though?). flight is in a few hours now so i'll just put these inside a plastic bag and hope for the best üò¨ Yes!! I always end up giving half my products to my husband to put in his bag lol. It's not fun when I'm traveling alone hey, the bottles are from Miniso! yep, the white pump tops just screw on/off so it's pretty trivial! the white pump tops screw off so it's pretty trivial, i just pumped from the original bottles straight into these ‚ò∫Ô∏è Four steps isn‚Äôt that much lol  .. what? Why ditch toner?  Is miniso similar to daiso? Came here to Say That! i've never found it in brick and mortar stores either, so online is really the only option. i use iHerb, although i do wait til I've accumulated enough of a cart to make the shipping worth it. LRP Antelios XL SPF 50+ Fluid Ultra-Light. bit of a mouthful but the best sunscreen that meets my two criteria (none of the actives i'm suspicious of e.g. octinoxate, and minimal white cast - it's got kind of a yellow tint actually, which works fine for my light tan skin) Why is airless pump important? Don't get them. Waste of resources. Yesssssss muji for life Lmao who let this person come to the party?  You can also wrap them in tape! Washi tape would be cute, but white electrical tape would be very minimal. Does anyone take their skincare stuff outside in the sunlight? That's weird anyways... Scoop it into a plastic Ziploc bag, cut a corner off, and squeeze it into your new container. Mess free!  you can use the bottle's pump to pump it into the bottle :^) You should be okay! That happens in pressurised containers sometimes, but an airless pulp doesn‚Äôt do it due to the lack of air inside lol  Let us know what happens!  These are the air pumpy ones?? I didn‚Äôt realize it was easy! Not saying it's not... Not the point As far as I'm concerned, toner doesn't really have a purpose. Toners came about to counteract the alkaline pH of cleansers, but cleansers these days are pH balanced. I will use an AHA toner every now and then, and I will sometimes use a toner as a quick sort of cleanup product, but by and large I go straight it with moisturizer on my still-damp face. The goal is to minimize trans-epidermal water loss. Anything watery is likely to draw water out of the skin, unless you go right over them with something occlusive. Miniso(Chinese) is in the same realm as Daiso(Japanese) but daiso has a more extensive variety of stuff and their prices are the same. Miniso has different pricing and less variety.  MINISO in my opinion is a step up from Daiso. I've been to both and the Miniso stuff is a little better quality, but more expensive.

It's still cheap kitsch though, keep that in mind. It removes the need for a straw :)  In normal bottles spent product is replaced by air, which causes oxidation of a lot of ingredients and might degrade their properties. In an airless pump, the bottom is a piston that moves upwards as the product is used, ensuring no air enters the container after you've started using it and until it's empty. Why‚Äôs that? If your comment is to be read one day by a future generation history will judge you harshly. They crashed :/ People who use sunscreen while outside might not find it all that weird.  A lot of stadiums have switched to clear bag policies. This would be important to know if I wanted to take my sunscreen to, say, a football game! Not sure why you called it ironic then?? Lol  I think loads of people on this sub would agree that toners can be super beneficial. Many of us use AHA/BHA toners as well as hydrating ones and notice a huge difference. I personally use Cezanne High Moist skin conditioner and it‚Äôs made a world of a difference in my skin feeling and lasting hydrated - *but* a big part of this sub is also still applying occlusives so that yes, we can trap all that moisture in. When I first started lurking here and getting into skincare that was a major part of what I read here - lock it all in with an occlusive. Of course YMMV because all of our skin is different but many of us have seen huge success with more than just washing our face and then applying moisturizer - it‚Äôs usually a lot of why we are here on this sub haha. Most of us were washing our faces and moisturizing but still not seeing any positive skin changes. I‚Äôm glad your routine works great for you though!  Plastic is very harmful to the environment. There are so many, billions, of empty plastic bottles that enter landfills and our seas. Buying empty plastic bottles is just crazy. Yeah, I'm all about doing the bare minimum, avoiding fragrance, and not disrupting the barrier function of the skin any more than necessary. Not sure why that earned so many downvotes, but whatever. [deleted] I agree. This sub and make up subs have a real problem with disregarding plastic waste it‚Äôs fucking ridiculous.  I think because this person was not asking for advice they were showing their decanted routine for travelling and you told them to ditch the toner (because that‚Äôs what works for you). OP has an established routine that includes toner and works for them.  Majority who will buy this likely already have something small around the house, you‚Äôre not buying it because you desperately need a travel container but because you want THIS set. And if not, if someone does need a travel container they could pick one up from a local shop instead of shipping it. The small travel container that is wasteful/uneconomical could be reused too.  Thanks. wonder why you got upvoted for agreeing with me but I got down voted lol Not sure. But the message is more important than the fake internet points.  **Hi everyone!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I didn't think Kiehl's was going to be worth it, but I also got a free sample of that same moisturizer and I was so wrong. I love it! I have sensitive skin, and it feels great, especially in this winter cold. We stan a drag race face w a skin care routine Lol the irony of having Trixie in the back of a minimalist routine üòÇüòÇ

As someone who only uses 5 products, I love this! Shoutout to having a simple morning routine. You‚Äôve inspired me to check out that toner mist, too...  I could always go for some more hydration! Is that Trixie Mattel in the background?!! This might be a long one, so settle in. My skin is generally normal/combination (a little drier in the winter, a little oiler in the summer). I experienced pretty severe acne has a teenager (ages 14-19); still get the occasional pimple. I also have a fair amount of pigmentation. I have noticed my skin can be a little sensitive (e.g., prone to redness, hives, eczema like rashes on the neck).

Throughout my teen years, I did pretty much what everyone else did - lots of Clean & Clear, Clearsil, scrubbing and not moisturizing. I didn't really get into skin care until my mid-20's, when I started using more "legit" products/ingredients like hyaluronic acid, AHA's, etc. In both stages, I definitely think I over-sensitized my skin just by using too much damn products.

Fast forward to now, where I've settled on pretty much these 5 products on a daily basis. I'm going to start with the PM, since that's the bulk of my routine:

1. Bioderma Sensibio H2O ($1.13/oz) - I'm putting the price per ounce (CDN) as I am all about affordability. I absolutely LOVE this product. I was a little iffy on micellar waters, thinking they were just gimmicky waters. But when I use this, my skin feels very refreshed, clean and cool (not in the menthol-y way). I typically saturate a cotton pad and gently wipe down my entire face/eyes before hopping in the shower. In the shower, I always rinse my face immediately. I personally don't think any micellar waters should be left on the skin.
2. Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash ($1.22/oz) - Ah, this childhood classic. Normally, I try to stick to fragrance-free, but something about the scent of this is just...nostalgic and comforting. I feel like this is a controversial item. I used this with success, but reading peoples negative feedback actually made me scared to use it... for no reason. This was a learning process where I had to just block out other peoples opinions - if it works for me, stick with it. I also use this in a very specific way; rather than massaging it in like a traditional cleanser, I just gently spread this over my skin, kind of like a mask. I try not let it foam up too much, and just let it sit on my skin anywhere between 10-30 seconds to let the 2% SA do it's thing. And I very much customize how I use it; sometimes it's all over, sometimes it's just my t-zone, sometimes it just my nose. More than any leave on AHA/BHA product, this has improved my skin texture SO much. And I truly think it helps minimize congestion/break outs. Never going to give this one up again.
3. LRP Toleriane Ultra 8 Mist ($7.50/oz) - This is another product I didn't think I'd like, as I was never a fan of toners. But, when I started using this last summer, I was so impressed. For me, this mist packs more of a hydration punch than any HA serum out there. I love the spray mechanism, love the minimal ingredients, and I friggin' love glycerin! I keep this in the fridge (just to feel extra bougie), and generously spritz this on my damp skin right after the shower. I'll press it in gently, but not too much.
4. Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream ($15.58/oz) - Kiehls never really stood out to me as a brand, and I only ended up trying this cream when I got a free sample; a few days later, I immediately purchased the 125 ml jar. I think there is a lot to say about simplicity in formula's; this, to me, is the perfect blend of humectants (glycerin), silicones and emollients (squalane + other plant oils). I never really pay much attention to how moisturizers feel on my skin after I apply it; this product keeps my skin hydrated ALL DAY/NIGHT, and I can feel that supple hydration in my skin. One example; I wore it during the day this past weekend when it was -20 degrees in Toronto, CA (plus windy and a little snowy). I was out running errands that day, and I would periodically check my skin; no tightness, no flakiness, zero dryness. My skin had that bouncy, hydrated feel all day. And best of all, this just melts into my skin; I don't feel the cream or any greasiness, I just feel the hydration. Again, I will use this moisturizer for life.

AM Routine:

1. Cerave Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 ($10.13/oz) - Yep, that's pretty much it. I usually wake up with my skin now feeling hydrated, so I don't even rinse my skin with water - just slap on this SPF. Love that it is light-weight, zero cast, no pilling or streaking and offers a bit of hydration from the ceramides. Does not burn or sting my skin. Is it the highest UVA protection available? Definitely not! Is this something I actually enjoy putting on my skin - YEP! And for that reason alone, I know I will always use this, every day. If it's going to be a super cold Canadian winter day, I might do a quite spritz of the LRP and a dab of Kiehls, and THEN this spf. Still no issues.

And that's pretty much it. I know my routine isn't the most... up to date with being cruelty-free and super sustainable. However, I believe that because I'm using such few products and that all the products are easily accessible (e.g., I don't have to order anything online/have it shipped), I think I'm doing my small part. And affordability is subjective, I totally get that. But again, only a few products, and with the most expensive one being approx. $15/oz (and it lasts a looooong time), I can comfortably sustain this routine on my budget.

Other misc. items that I use (not pictured):

1. The Ordinary Squalane - I use this to shave. I have facial hair, and shave my neck a couple times a week. I rarely get any shaving irritation now thanks to squalane.
2. Eucerin Aquaphor - The ONLY thing I will use on my lips.
3. Cerave Moisturizing Lotion/Cream - I have the lotion, my partner has the tub cream. I use both for the body. Simple and effective. When they run out, I'm considering trying out [this](https://incidecoder.com/products/aveeno-intense-relief-moisture-repair-cream) Aveeno cream, as my skin can get a little itchy. Trixies make up routine is most defiantly not down to 5 products I love this! I'm working on reducing the number of products I use too. When I started getting into skincare I was overwhelmed by the amount of products that is available, and when a little crazy. I have very fussy skin, so I'm always looking for the next thing, hoping it's the one holy grail that is going to change my skin. But as I kept educating myself on actives and formulas ( omg, "educating", who do I think I am lol) I came to the realization sometimes it's better to stick to fewer, simpler products that get the job done. I also agree with what you say about sticking with products that work for you, no matter what other people say. I try to stay away from mineral oil ‚Äì while many people use it I can't, it clogs my pores and causes cysts on my jawline. Same with any kind of pure oil ‚Äì no matter how many times Becky will tell me *oily skin needs oils too!!1!!1!* I'll never use one on its own, because it breaks me out. You do you boo Wow I thought I was the only one who love the Neutrogena cleanser <3 haha ! That bioderma sensibio is the best as well! I‚Äôm glad someone else shares my love for the Ultra-light CeraVe lotion!!! Just started incorporating SPF in my routine and I‚Äôm obsessed with this. My skin is more oily so I love the matte finish it gives! What is the anti-haul? Clear skin, shantay...you stay Despite the amount of makeup, Trixie has pretty gorgeous skin out of drag so I'd trust her as my skincare muse, too. Don't we all pray that we could wear the same amount of makeup, scrub it off every day, and *not* slough off the top 4 layers of our skin? Oh I also like the cerave cream, idk if the aveeno cream is similar, but the aveeno lotion is very soothing, due to the colloidial oat, just the smell is a bit weird but I prefer a weird smell over a scented version! I just found that Kiehl's as well! It's probably going to be a little heavy for me for the summer but it's fabulous in winter. The Neutrogena is a favorite of mine as well. That Kiehls moisturizer is so freaking great in the wintertime. My skin absolutely loves the stuff. Love the kiehl‚Äôs cream! I‚Äôve tried dozens and dozens of moisturizers but I always go back to this one. It‚Äôs just a good, no nonsense, and reliable product I'm loving this idea! Congrats on the routine! Ugh, I'm jealous af! I can never part with my exfoliants üòì How do you like the orange oil free wash? I tried to start out 2019 as a responsible adult with a skincare routine but after a week of every other day use my skin began to have dry scaly micro flakes around the corners of my nose, mouth, and around my chin for about three days after I stopped using them upon noticing it. I used one other mask product two times during the week, the Que Bella cucumber peel off gel mask. I'm not sure which of the two may have caused it. Your skin sounds similar to mine (and as a fellow Canadian I have similar issues with winter dryness). I also love the Cerave Ultra-light SPF! And your review makes me want to check out the LRP mist and the Kiehl‚Äôs cream! *cries in the most random combination skin ever* I'm working on the same thing! I just cut back to a very similar routine, which I'm going to stick to for minimum one month so I can re-assess if I need more, such as either another product to control breakouts/blackheads or a stronger moisturizer. My skin is quite dry right now because I cut back to just an oil free moisturizer, not a heavier cream, as I wait and see if perhaps the heavier cream is what was giving me some of those breakouts to begin with... it might not be the case but since I'm acne-prone I figured I should experiment for a bit and make sure I'm not overdoing it! 

I'm happy you have gotten yourself down to such a simple routine and am hoping I'll be there with you soon! Yes! I began breaking out and in an effort to figure out who the culprit was I stripped my routine down. Turns out it might have been one culprit, or maybe I was just overwhelming my skin! But I just oil cleanse, then put my azelaic acid, then an occlusive. It's all I need. I used that face wash once when I was a preteen because my older sister left it in the bathroom and it dried out and irritated my skin so badly. But then again I wasn‚Äôt using a moisturizer because I had been lead to believe it wasn‚Äôt necessary for oily/acne prone skin. I‚Äôm so glad that it actually does work well for some people even if it didn‚Äôt for me! Love the Kiehl's cream! 4 of my 5 products are Kiehl's. Can you name that bottle to the far right? What is an anti-haul? I'm really digging these posts about simple routines. i actually appreciate the anti haul because im on a tight budget and can't afford all the products people say you "need", so this makes me feel a bit better Trixxie Mattell!!!! the neutrogena acne wash really irritated my skin :( and dried tf out of it. Bonus Trixie! OMG I swear by the Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream. My face absolutely loves it and I could not believe how soft it make my skin. <3 Nattie Upvote for Rupaul‚Äôs Drag Race in the background, skincare irrelevant. How is it the cerave product? Do you use light moisturizer even if you said that you have dry skin in winter season? Any exfoliant? r/antihaul Where do you buy your Bioderma from? I‚Äôm wary of buying products on Amazon. Planning to try the khiels. Hope it works for me! That Cerave SPF lotion is such a godsend. I just purchased a tube a few weeks ago and I'm obsessed with it. There‚Äôs a skinny legend in your background. I've been looking for a light weight moisturizing SPF for a while. I think i may have found out. Can't wait to try it out. Im sure you've patch tested and figured your tolerance to the Cerave Ultra light cream, but just as a PSA for any others who may not have -- this cream gave me unbearable eye stinging and i developed a chronic eye condition (dryness, redness) righh after using it. Be careful! Are you based out of India, by any chance? Well you've just inspired me to crack open the jar of Khiehls cream tonight, which has been sitting in my stash for the past six months I‚Äôm really loving this anti-haul stuff. Honestly I stopped going on skincare addiction and reddit for a while because it was too consumerist for me with all the ‚Äúshelfie‚Äù photos. I don‚Äôt think most people need more than a couple products on their routines. That's my fave sunscreen! :) Trixieüòç Congratz! I will be joining the anti - haul very very soon too!! So glad to see people is taking this movement serious. üåô I see u trixie I switch from the Kiehl's to Drunk Elephant and I haven't turned back! I recommend trying it when your done! The packaging is sooooo nice and keeps everything fresh! Love the Bioderma Meeker Water & the Kiehl's Ulta Facial Cream! Get rid of that Neutrogena face wash its the worse Exact same story here. I wrote it off when I got the sample, then tried it and bought it a week later. I also live in a really cold area (New England)  and now that I'm using the Kiehl's, my skin isn't tight, red or stinging the way it normally is in winter. I wanted to like it but my face instantly broke out. Very hydrating though. I have combo/oily skin, my sister has dry, eczema-prone skin, and we both adore this moisturizer. It replaced the DE Protini for me! I love my Kiehls so much. I also have sensitive skin. Yeah. It‚Äôs the only face lotion that I have found so far that doesn‚Äôt break me out. Salute! Trixie should be the face of everyone's skin care routine though lol!

And yes - if your skin is dehydrated and sensitive, I definitely recommend the LRP Mist. Glycerin can feel  a little sticky to some people, but I absolutely love it. ScA has been blessed. üôè Yeppp hah! Was eating breakfast and watching some Drag Race All Stars! in desperate need of some new episodes of unhhhhhh Oh my goodness I loooove Tracey Martell She is my favorite <3 Do you use the squaline in lieu of shaving cream? Or before or after? My partner has THICK facial hair and acne hidden in it and I‚Äôd love to get a product to help with irritation with his sensitive skin! Thanks! [deleted] I love your simple routine, and your skin sounds similar to mine! One tip (maybe you've already tried it) is to try a balm cleanser instead of the micellar water. I've found it to be super helpful for my combo, sensitive skin. Wow! Thank you for such detailed explanation of your routine. I love how simple it is - I‚Äôm currently going through the phase where I use too many products each day, but skin isn‚Äôt showing any improvements. I‚Äôd be intrigued to try simplified morning routine with just moisturizing sunscreen. Do you not wash your face at all? It doesn‚Äôt cause breakouts or oiliness throughout the day? Now I'm totally intrigued by your Neutrogena face wash method! I had bought this (for the first time in a long time) again probably about a year ago and juuust threw it out while decluttering. üôÑ I think I felt like it was too harsh for my skin, but applying it the way you did sounds like it would make a difference. And the fact that it's helped your skin's texture so much, mine could definitely use some help. where did you pick up the LRP mist in Toronto? I'd love to give it a try! Thank you for being open about facial hair! Does using oil clog up your razor? Just curious, what's the watermark on the LRP mist and do all the products have it. (Never seen this product before lol) you can use eucerin aquaphor on lips??! I always have super dry lips and nothing seems to be working for me...

EDIT: never mind, there's a lip balm, I thought you meant the cream. LOL >I personally don't think any micellar waters should be left on the skin.

I wanted to ask about this, as many many people swear by leaving micellar water on. Is there a big difference between using micellar water to wipe your face right before you shower and wash? Vs. just directly showering/washing your face without wiping with micellar first? Why do people use products with silicone in them? While silicone isn‚Äôt damaging it is just a cheap way to bulk out a product and make it look like it‚Äôs making your skin better without actually doing anything. What‚Äôs the question? Are you just sharing? Actuallllly, have you seen her "taking make up off routine" video on Youtube? It seems like she's also down to keeping it simple. 

But yeah, her make up routine is just... wow. I friggin love your comment; absolutely in the same boat as you!

This might sound a bit much, but even on IG, I've stopped following a lot of influencers who just post wild routines with different products every day. Even seeing that less often has made it easier to just stick with my wonderfully boring but effective routine haha. I've also tried to just follow the more educational folks, like Lab Muffin Science, who are actually providing useful knowledge on skin care. 

Also - those damn oils hah! I cannot tell you the amount of times I tried to convince myself pure rose hip or marula oil would work as a moisturizer. I think thats why I like the Kiehls cream so much; it does have squalane and a small amount of other plant oils (avocado, apricot, sweet almond), but it's the overall formula that matters. Yay - I'm glad I'm not the only one hahah! I am on my 5th bottle of it! No white cast or greasiness, and I love wearing it! Though for a long summer day I switch out to a dedicated sunscreen. It was in reference to [this fantastic post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/epettb/misc_is_2020_time_to_retire_the_idea_of_the_haul/) made a couple days ago :) I'm definitely fine with weird smells haha. But yeah, I figured the colloiodal oat would help out! I'm curious to see how it'll work in the summer too. Definitely won't need to use it in the day time. But my apartment gets super-blasted with air conditioning in the summertime, so I'm hoping I can just stick with it as a night cream :) I definitely loved my physical and chemical exfoliants in the past - they can be very effective :)

If you know you're not over-using them and your skin barrier is fine, no need to part with them! I really like it and have used it for various periods since I was a teen. But I don't use it like a traditional face wash. I use the Bioderma micellar water for the bulk of the cleansing. Then I take the oil free acne wash, and just gently spread it over my face (I try not to let it foam up too much). It sits on my face for 10-30 seconds, depending on how I feel. Then I just rinse it off. I also sometimes only use it on certain areas (e.g., t-zone). Again, just depends on how my skin is feeling. I found using it this way eliminates the dryness, but still keeps the salicylic acid effective :) If you have a Shoppers Drug Mart near you (or even a Rexall), they usually have testers for the LRP mist out, so you can at least try it/see how it feels. Plus, I feel like both places have sales often enough that you can get it for a good price :) 

Also, if you're able to get to a Kiehls store, they're pretty good about giving samples! Best of luck to you too! 

Have you tried using Squalane or moisturizers with squalane. I've read that it's an "oil' that is compatible with acne-prone skin; I definitely found that to be the case with me. What else do you use from them? That is the La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra 8 mist :) This. Plus, I think it's super important to filter out influences (instagram, youtube, influencers, whatever), because they don't know what your skin \*needs\*, only you do. And there is no shame in shopping on a budget! That's a bummer :( I really feel like people either hate or love this product. How long have you used it for/have you used in the summer time/warmer season? Love the CeraVe sunscreen. It's super light weight and no cast or shininess. It is a chemical sunscreen with Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate and Octocrylene - so just be mindful if you've previously had a negative reaction to these ingredients. 

And so far, I've been able to mostly just use the sunscreen alone. Because I'm not washing my face in the morning, there's no dryness from that. But, it also just depends on the weather. For reference, today it's -2 degrees celcius (feels like -8) where I live, and I just wore the sunscreen, no moisturizer. If it were to get colder, like -20, I definitely would add a bit of the Kiehls moisturizer first.

Also, it's important to note that I don't spend a lot of time outside. Other than my 40 minute commute to work (via streetcar), my skin isn't in the cold that much. The Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne wash has 2% salicylic acid. I also believe the pH of the cleanser is around 3.5-3.6, so it is actually an effective, exfoliating cleanser. 

Other then that, I don't use any leave on AHA's or any physical scrubs :) I live in Toronto (Canada). It‚Äôs easily available at drugstores like Shoppers Drug Mart or Rexall üôÇ Yesss! Agree with you both :) definitely have not noticed any sensitization from the cream. Mostly just love that it actually keeps my skin hydrated for a long period of time. Before using Kiehls, I was using [Bioderma's Sensibio Light Cream](https://www.bioderma.ca/en/products/sensibio/light-cream/) mixed with The Ordinary's Squalane. I really liked the Light Cream, but I just found it too pricey for the size. But I think the formulation is genius; oil-free and silicone-free, and packed with humectants. If you're prone to break outs, it might be worthwhile to check it out. My aesthetician kept telling me something was clogging my pores. I scaled down to only this for a month. Turns out the moisturizer was causing the problem. I have combination/oily skin for reference. My skin is the worst it's been in years currently :/ What did you eventually land on? I‚Äôm coming to the end of my jar of it and I‚Äôm very meh. Can‚Äôt decide what else to try. I was using too much at first, then scaled down a little. It's easy to over-apply, and  I can see how it wouldn't work for many people. Yes!! My sensitive skin loves kiehls. Especially in the dry ass winter *whip crack sound* 

ty ty that a guy putting makeup on his face? LONG THICK LEGS A TARANTULA Sounds like actual heaven- breakfast foods, skincare and RPDR are three of my favorite things ever. Have you seen her and Katya watching Netflix shows? So good! I just use the squalane. First, I'll take a hot, wet towel (rung out) and press it onto the neck area a few times, to warm up and soften the area. Then I put a full pipette of the squalane on. It really softens the skin/hair. Plus, I like this over shaving cream, because then I can actually see where I'm shaving. 

Also, not sure if this makes a difference, but I use the Gilette Mach 3 razer (the one with 3 blades). I've used 2-blade, 4-blade, and 5-blade razers... always come back to the Mach 3. Hahah, yeah - this Toronto winter weather we're having is a pain in the ass. I hope it works for you, if you try it. I would go to a Kiehl's store and try and get a sample first; the sample sachet is a pretty decent size. Plus it's always good to be safe when you're introducing a new product while on tret! Thank you for the positive comment :) I have tried some cleansing balms. I actually really like Clinique's TTDO Balm. But, from a price point, Bioderma is more affordable. The last time I bought it I actually got two 500ml bottles for just over $20. 

Also, since I don't wear any make up or tinted SPF, I don't feel like my skin neeeeeds a cleansing balm. But I did love how the clinique one rinsed off so easily :) I don't use any cleanser at all in the morning; at most (maybe in the summertime), I'll splash my face with cool water. No issues with excess oiliness (especially now that it's winter). No difference in break outs either. 

There's a lot of different external factors to this as well - I always shower before bed, so I'm going to sleep with clean/hydrated skin. I try to switch out my pillow case every other/every two days, to keep that fresh. Personally, I don't sweat that much while I sleep... at all lol. Even in the summer, my apartment has crazy cold air conditioning. 

A couple summers ago, I used the La Roche Posay sero zinc spray in the morning (would spray my face, and then wipe with cotton pads). I actually really enjoyed the mist... but, trying to minimize my routine, it was just another product that I reallllly didn't need. But if you're looking to skip cleansing in the morning, using the sero zinc mist might be a good transition item :) I found their method interesting as well. 


This wash wrecked my face using it as a cleanser.  Using it in a way similar to the way OP did, however, didn‚Äôt irritate my skin. I only did it once though, and I was too scared to do it again since it was just too risky for me. I got it at the Shoppers Drug Mart at Queen Street E & Carlaw Ave. I think most SDM should carry it now though since it has been out for a while :) I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it clogging up the razor I use (Gillette Mach 3 Turbo). In between strokes, I run it under hot water. I‚Äôll also make sure to (carefully) wipe the blade at the end with a wet towel. Do you mean the giant blue letters on the bottle? It just says "0%" - I think because there's no alcohol or fragrance in it. So, from my understanding, the surfactants in micellar waters are super gentle - so they could be left on the skin without irritating it. The Bioderma one uses PEG-6 Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Glycerides. My issue is, you are essentially wiping around the dirt/makeup/sunscreen with the cotton pad. A lot of it may come off on the cotton pad, but some of it may stay on the skin. So thats why I rinse it off (in the shower), just to make sure there's no gunk left. 

You could, theoretically, just keep wiping with micellar until the cotton pad is completely clean... but I think that's just wasteful? To each their own though :) While I agree that silicones are a cheap ingredient (cost-wise), I think it's a little naive to say they have no purpose in skin care products. Lab Muffin did a great [post/video](https://labmuffin.com/silicone-mythbusting-with-video/) about myth-busting silicones.

Essentially, silicones will not clog pores, are actually hypo-allergenic, they do help with moisturizing the skin, and, depending on the formula, can help with active ingredients (e.g., retinol) penetrating the skin. They're also great for stabilizing ingredients. 

Personally, I don't believe that any moisturizer is going to erase wrinkles or reverse signs of aging. I do strongly believe though that a well-formulated moisturizer with silicones can greatly help your skin retain moisture, therefore feeling more hydrated and healthy. Nope I haven‚Äôt. Is it on her YouTube page? 

Her make up routine is what I aspire to have my routine like. Are we the same person? I unfollowed a lot of "beauty gurus" because of the same reason, I couldn't stand it anymore, also because it was triggering. Seeing all those new products, all those 123 steps korean routines were making me feel like I needed a lot of extra steps. My skin kinda sucks, so I almost felt guilty about it, in a "look, your skin is a mess because you're not doing enough" way. *Bitch, listen*. I'm a college student, I need money to eat, I can't afford SK-II toners, so how about focusing on ingredients and formulas instead of falling for the hype, eh?

Yes, frickin' yes, it's the overall formula that matters! I can use moisturizers that contain mineral oil and paraffinum (Aquaphor saved my eyelids from eczema), but I can't use Albolene as a makeup remover. It's as simple, or as complicated, as that :) So I'd say give it a try :) Maybe I'll try diluting it next time and maybe it wont aggrivate my skin as much. How often do you use it? I tried it ages ago and did like it. I remember it absorbed fast and felt very light! Perhaps I will give it another go if I find myself needed a bit more moisture! Thanks for the reminder. Creamy eye treatment, skin rescuer and ultra facial deep moisture balm

I live in a dry climate. I started using it in August of last year I believe Gotcha! Thanks :) Also, if you fly regularly, I swear there‚Äôs a Kiehl‚Äôs in almost every major airport. Where do you find it? You've caught my interest. How does the Kiehls compare to CeraVe in the tub, or FAB's Ultra Repair Cream? If you've tried them, of course. PC Anti Aging Hydrator right now, but it‚Äôs sadly not vegan so I‚Äôm back to square one. I‚Äôm trying the Skin Balancing Moisturizer next, since PC was having a sale that made it cheaper than other options I was looking at. Trixie is a drag queen. Anybody can wear makeup if they want to AND IF YOU CALL ME KITTY GIRL I CAN HANDLE YA It is both a calming, and delightfully dramatic way to start the day. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúI like to Watch‚Äù. 

Which is genius. Yes omg!!!! You just saved me for Valentine‚Äôs Day ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è thanks much! Thank you! oh cool thanks Dude, that post is sponsored by Grant Industries who sell silicones. She basically admits that it does limit the amount of actives getting through to the skin. She says it‚Äôs not completely occlusive. Which means that only some actives penetrate. They don‚Äôt moisturise, they prevent water from escaping. I don‚Äôt think they are terrible mind you and I‚Äôm not anti synthetics, I just don‚Äôt see many benefits to using them. Companies really do just use them because they are cheap, safe, and look like they have immediate effects. [De-Drag with Trixie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWQ7nvNqSTU) \- easily the most entertaining skin care routine video I've watched We're probably skin care kindred spirits haha. Even though I'm no longer a college student, I still gotta budget. Hell, even the Kiehl's cream is pushing it for me. But focusing on formula, and silencing those foolish influencers AND seeing the positive in my own skin is what matters the most :) 

I would also choose pizza over SK II any day. Hell, I would choose frozen french fries over SK II! Max, I'll use it once a day, in the evening. Even with the way I use it, I think using it twice in a day would be too harsh. 

I would say, try experimenting with how long you leave it on your skin. From my understanding, salicylic acid can be effective in a cleanser and doesn't need to stay on the skin to "work." So try spreading it/leaving it for 10 seconds and slowly working it up to longer? They're all silicone free, which was very important to me. Did you find that it worked well in the warmer temp? Or was it too heavy? I have bought this specific Kiehl‚Äôs annually when I fly to California and it lasts me all year. It‚Äôs perfect. Kiehl's do stand-alone stores in a lot of major cities. They're also sold at Nordstrom and The Bay. You should be able to just google "Kiehls + your city" and hopefully something will pop up :) Ooh and they do ship their products too. I got it at Sephora! Heathrow & Gatwick have them! I haven't used the FAB cream. 

Compared to Cerave in the tub, I find that Kiehl's Ultra absorbs into the skin better, and leaves it feeling...softer. Also for me personally, after using the Cerave tub for an extended period of time on my face, it did cause congestion and small breakouts. I‚Äôve used all, I have combo acne prone skin and cerave and fab broke me out severely, fab at least hydrated while it did it, and kiehl‚Äôs is good and hydrating but also is kinda breaking me out. I've used all three. They are comparable, depending on what you're looking for. I found the CeraVe too heavy and clogging for my face, but I use it for my body. The FAB is nice, but once I put the Kiehl's on... heaven. And I was also skeptical like some others here. I bought a tub on clearance at TJ Maxx and I am now a believer.


I haven't used in warmer weather yet, but I have a feeling it will be too heavy. Oils > shaving cream all day! When I still shaved my legs I used coconut oil. I've never shaved my face but wouldn't put coconut oil there because it's way too much for my skin. To each their own I guess :) even if sponsored, I still fully trust her, with her background in science, plus my own personal experience using silicones. 

I would definitely love it if the Kiehl's moisturizer was cheaper, but considering it's the only "expensive" item I use, I'm not mad. Plus, at least its not totally ridiculously priced (looking at you La Mer). Thanks so much for your help! I had no problems with it Birmingham new street/grand central train station has one Oh yeah, I don‚Äôt think she is lying, because she basically tells the truth about silicones. Just reading through her arguments they don‚Äôt sound that great to me, like saying that silicones don‚Äôt stop active ingredients penetrating the skin, they just stop the majority of them penetrating (just one example). She is super careful with her language. 

I agree with you about La Mer though. It has to be the biggest scam ever. They use mineral oil (highly refined I might add), which has been linked to arthritis in a study done here in Australia. But you put silicones on top of actives, not underneath? What scenario would you need actives to penetrate silicones? Am I missing something here? > (highly refined I might add)

Er..... this is a good thing. You don't want to put carcinogenic contaminants on your skin........ What!? Mineral oil is linked to arthritis?! How? I am very curious. I have not heard of that link before. I'm not sure exactly. This was just one of the author's points that I didn't think made much sense. Maybe she brought it up because silicones are really difficult to clean off the face which means build up for the next use? At any rate, my point was never about silicones being terrible in any way, more that they are just used because they are safe and cheap, and we are probably paying a bit too much for many of the products that include them. Yes, I know it‚Äôs a good thing. I was adding it in case someone knew something I didn‚Äôt about quality of mineral oil. I‚Äôm pretty open minded about this one and am willing to be persuaded otherwise. I think it‚Äôs been hard to prove because it takes arthritis a long time to develop in humans but they use mineral oil to give rats arthritis so that they can find a cure for it. https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar1824 That's a fairly low quality and in this case completely irrelevant study.  

From the citations:
Rats from a specific strain that is particularly susceptible to arthritis were injected with an emulsion of mineral oil, mannide monooleate and water and showed signs of arthritis. In two cases they abraded their skin and applied the emulsion on the wound, and it caused swelling... but so did doing that with olive oil. 

It doesn't mean much unless you're of the same species. e.g., thalidomide doesn't cause mutations in rats.

The study itself:

>Specific questions were asked about occupational exposure to cutting oil, motor oil, form oil, hydraulic oil and asphalt, respectively. This enabled the classification of cases and controls with regard to ever having been occupationally exposed to each of these mineral oils, respectively. Subjects who reported exposure to any of these mineral oils were classified as exposed to any mineral oil.

Non-cosmetic mineral oil can have impurities and contaminants (some of which can be carcinogenic. *Untreated* mineral oil is a carcinogen, but refined mineral oil is not [\[Source\]](https://www.osha.gov/chemicaldata/chemResult.html?RecNo=704)). There are other concerns associated with occupational exposure to most of those things, and they're not just made of mineral oil either. For example, hydraulic oil can be a number of different substances and usually has additives. 


>Only men reported a substantial occupational exposure to mineral oils (in total 135 cases and 132 controls), with occupational exposure to mineral oils uncommon among women (21 cases and 21 controls). **Only men were retained in the further analysis.**

In an era in which many women used baby oil (scented mineral oil) after the shower, and most moisturising creams had *paraffinum liquidum* (mineral oil) as one of the main ingredients, this study chose to disregard both of those things and simply cherrypicked the results. Thank you for the link! So fascinating! Oh awesome, an expert to help me understand the study. If possible, I have a few questions. Why do they experiment on rats if the results only apply to the same species? Do they know exactly what it was in the untreated mineral oil causing arthritis? From your comment I thought maybe you thought carcinogens were the culprit, did I misunderstand you? If not, do you think it is best to er on the side of caution or would you keep using it? 

I‚Äôm no scientist but a scientist I know was studying arthritis and when I asked him how he gave his rats arthritis he said mineral oil. I don‚Äôt know what type he used unfortunately but he did warn me against all types. He said that one thing he found was that the majority of arthritis sufferers were women. We have long thought that because of this, it must be some sort of hormonal thing causing it, but his theory was that it was the mineral oil they used, as you described, baby oil and such. He was the one who told me not to use mineral oil products. The study was cut short by the ethics committee because of the treatment of rats so there isn‚Äôt anything published on it (thus my reluctance to write about it earlier). 

I guess for me personally, having spoken to a scientist about this and having been warned against all mineral oil skin products, I won‚Äôt be purchasing any. There are enough correlations for me to not want to take that risk with the only body I will ever have. Having said this, I‚Äôm always looking for more information on this so I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing more of your thoughts. The study refers only to unrefined/untreated industrial mineral oil (a known carcinogen) mixed with different substances. They simply disregarded other sources of exposure such as baby oil, creams and cosmetics, which contain very refined and purified mineral oil (non carcinogenic). It's irrelevant unless you work in certain industries. 

Or unless you're a rat from a specific strain bred to become highly susceptible to arthritis-like inflammation, and you like to inject yourself with mineral oil mixed with a surfactant. ;) In which case.... whatever floats your boat haha No probs :) Thank you for the context. Always important. **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

As an alternative sunscreen you could try the purito centella unscented spf 50, I checked on skincarisma and the ingredients are overall irritant free and it doesn‚Äôt leave white cast too. Skincarisma is a good website if you‚Äôre also looking for products tailored for your skin imo. I have similar problems and skin type so I understand the struggle to find decent skincare. D: I have very sensitive skin, so I like to have travel sizes of the products I know work for me so I don‚Äôt break out when I‚Äôm traveling. I know I could just put the product in empty travel bottles but I love miniatures so I think it‚Äôs cuter like this.

Skin type: dry, sensitive.
Skin concerns: large pores, redness, uneven texture

**Routine:**

AM - no shower

* Splash face with water
* TO Hyaluronic Acid
* Vanicream Lite Lotion
* LPR Anthelios Gentle Lotion SPF 50 (not pictured)

AM - with shower

* Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser in shower
* TO Hyaluronic Acid right after I get out of shower while my face is damp
* Vanicream Lite Lotion after HA dries
* LPR Anthelios Gentle Lotion SPF 50 (not pictured)

PM

* Garnier Micellar Water for Sensitive Skin
* TO Niacinamide
* Vanicream Lite Lotion

As I mentioned, I have sensitive skin that is prone to reactions. For whatever reason, every single cleanser I tried was breaking me out with the same reaction. It was incredibly frustrating but eventually I learned I can‚Äôt use a traditional cleanser every day. Thus, I use the Micellar Water every day (with reusable cotton rounds) and the Cetaphil every other day. I also hate using traditional cleansers because they make a mess, so I prefer to use it in the shower. The Hyaluronic Acid works better with wet skin, so I like to use it when I get of the shower and my skin is already damp. I like the HA a lot - leaves my skin feeling supple and softer than if I just use the Vanicream alone (my HG moisturizer simply because it doesn‚Äôt cause a reaction - not because it‚Äôs the most hydrating).

I am currently patch testing the Niacinamide and I believe it‚Äôs causing a reaction for me, which I‚Äôm really bummed about because I was so excited (but I know some people can‚Äôt tolerate it). I am going to suspend patch testing for a couple of days and then use a different spot. If I still get the reaction I may return the large bottle. I think I may order some TO Azelaic Acid instead to help with redness.

I don‚Äôt love the LPR Anthelios Lotion for a sunscreen, it‚Äôs too thick and leaves a cast. It would be better for a beach trip than everyday use. I think I will try Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF because I‚Äôve heard such great things. I may also try Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream, or something else if anyone has any other Klairs recommendations (trying to get free shipping on the SPF). I have almost the same skin and routine! I also have rosacea though, and I find azelaic acid helps a lot with the redness, maybe try Paula's Choice 10% booster Vanicream is amazing. Effective and never irritating. I‚Äôve switched a majority of my products to Inkey List, TO, CeraVe, and Vanicream from almost exclusively HE products. My skin is really liking the switch. Can anyone improve on this shelfie in any way? Is there something that should be added in your opinion?
I have the *exact* same shelfie (without the minis) with the addition of vitamin C, so I'm looking for any advice This is adorable [deleted] That‚Äôs a delight. It might be childish, but I absolutely adore seeing products sized down. There‚Äôs something really cute about that. Looks good I‚Äôve heard Vanicream‚Äôs sunscreen is highly recommended too! A dermatologist I follow rates it 4/5 [deleted] i can‚Äôt express on how i love those pink micellar water. feels great removing my makeup with just one wipe of wet cotton haha. Where did you get the adorable squeezy tube of Vanicream!? That looks so convenient! Family reunion! This is so adorable!! Well isn‚Äôt this precious Is the lite lotion occlusive enough, you find?  I have the regular version and I didn't order the lite yet since I still have emulsions/lighter lotions.  The regular vanicream is going to be WAYYY too heavy really soon. sorry ik this post is kinda old but where did you get the mini vanicream lotion? This is adorable! How do you apply the Ordinary products? Do you mix it with something or do you just apply it all over your face? What‚Äôs your routine Omg... thank you. Just subbed Don‚Äôt ever talk to me or my son or to me or my son or to me or my son or to me or my son or to me or my son Yes! Some of their formulas have larger sizes available, the more popular ones!

I have a large size of the Buffet. Lmfao I thought they had smaller bottles. That makes sense the odd one out is the bigger bottle üòÇ My thoughts exactly I am obsessed with Skincarisma, I don't purchase anything without checking that website first. Truly a life saver for sensitive skin. Plus it's nice to feel a little more educated about ingredients, and helps me identify would could be causing irritation.

Edit: Forgot to answer your question! I prefer a body lotion that‚Äôs a little thicker but I have used the Vanicream as a body lotion (when I first started dating my bf and didn‚Äôt want to bombard his apartment with a million products) and it worked pretty well Fellow dry sensitive skin checking in: to niacinamide didn't work for me. Do you have keratosis Pilaris on your arms? Niacinamide helps with keratin production so I found that it cause my to have the keratosis bumps and redness on my face. Disappointing since it's such a miracle product for so many people. Have you tried a milk cleanser? Leaving Micellar water residue on your face isn‚Äôt the best and could be drying your skin out in the long run Did the TO Niacinamide pill? How many drops of the TO niacinamide do you apply? I heard their unscented toner is great- but yeah their midnight blue calming cream sounds great as well I feel you on the cleanser thing, my skin is the same and it's driving me nuts. I second the recommendation for the klairs unscented toner, super hydrating and actually doesn't break me out! Might be worth giving Elta MD sunscreen a try, I use [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00464EC1E/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_V6NKEb7YHWF58) one. My skin is very sensitive to both irritation and acne and does well with it. It is also pretty light in texture and gives me minimal white cast, so it‚Äôs become my HG! as a large pore skin person with uneven texture I'd not recommend the Klairs sunscreen. Rosacea sufferer here! I‚Äôm working on finding products my skin doesn‚Äôt immediately flare up at. Not tried either of these! How is the booster? I suspect I have a mild form of rosacea as well - once quarantine ends I am planning to go to a dermatologist.

Salicylic Acid tends to really dry me out, which is in the Paula's Choice booster. I think I will try the Ordinary and see how it works for me, though the Azelaic Acid is the fourth ingredient on that one. I like that the Inkey List tends to have shorter lists of ingredients. That‚Äôs also why I love Vanicream and the Ordinary. My skin just can‚Äôt tolerate tons of ingredients in one product. 

I actually have a Bakuchiol moisturizer from the Inkey List but I stopped using it because I didn't see much by way of results. However it wasn't irritating which is still good for me! [deleted] Here are some products I‚Äôd like to (slowly) add into my routine or have considered, based on my skin type, prior research, and some suggestions in this thread: 
TO Azelaic Acid, 
Klairs Unscented Supple Preparation Toner, 
Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream, 
First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair, Serum or Cream

What skin concerns do you have? What would you use instead? I would love to buy some but it's so hard to find and expensive that I feel like it's going to be discontinued soon or something As I mentioned, I have really sensitive skin. If I use it everyday I get a reaction (as I do with most cleansers), so I use it every other day in the shower just to make sure I‚Äôm fully cleaning my face as opposed to just using the Micellar water. It‚Äôs pretty good and definitely gentle, but I‚Äôve yet to find a traditional cleanser I can use everyday. On Amazon! I keep one on my desk at work and one in my travel bag. It‚Äôs not the most hydrating and I‚Äôd really like to find another cream or lotion to layer on top, but it doesn‚Äôt cause a reaction for me like most moisturizers so it‚Äôs my favorite from that perspective. My face definitely appreciates when there are fewer ingredients. Using the HA before applying the Lite Lotion helps with hydration. I just recently purchased the vanicream moisturizing cream after seeing recommendations for it on this sub. I have acne prone skin but I put the cream on my hands and legs and it left a tacky feeling for a few minutes. I've never experienced this with a moisturizer and I'm afraid to put it on my face. Does this happen to you? On Amazon! First thing that came to mind Ha ha! So did I. That sub is funny. I actually do have KP on my arms. That is very interesting that there is a correlation. Wish I had known that before, but thank you for commenting. 

Do you have an product recommendations to help with keratin production? Or general guidelines based on having keratosis pilaris?

Edit: I‚Äôm looking into First Aid Beauty KP Bump Eraser Body Scrub for my arms. I wonder if the CCs on my forehead are actually KP? You‚Äôve really blown my mind with this I have KP on my arms but I react fine to it, hm interesting Whaaaaaat? no! I have KP (worse sometimes than others) and I use niacinamide gel...and this explains the freaking bumps on the sides of my face that get ALSO  worse when I also use anything Cerave...EltaMD...Why I can't use LRP Toleraine gentle cleanser...

shit man this changes everything! I haven‚Äôt but that may be a good idea. Do you have any you recommend? What does it mean to "pill"? A little bit, I found if I let it dry before I put my moisturizer on that helped. I haven‚Äôt used it that much though. I ordered both...oops. Just had to get the free shipping Uh oh! I already ordered it so I‚Äôll have to try for myself, what was your experience? Sorry I should clarify, it's just one product, Paula's choice 10% azelaic acid booster. I use it AM and PM daily, takes about a week to notice but definitely reduces redness and evens out tone for me! 
My skin is super dry/sensitive and it seems to agree with me. 
Also, the Garnier micellar water OP posted above is the only cleanser I've tried that doesn't dry my skin out haha. Good luck! The ordinary has an azelaic acid product too, it‚Äôs only $8 instead of Paula‚Äôs Choice‚Äôs $36. And in my experience they deliver the same results. Bakuchiol isn‚Äôt very clinically studied from what I‚Äôve researched. I follow Dr. Dray on YouTube and her advice is pretty solid IMO. Although some of her recommendations and philosophies I give a pinch of side eye to. üòÅ I rotate the ones I listed between other products. Even though I have acne/oily skin it gets incredibly irritated and sensitive. Then I switch to the Vani line. I use the gentle face cleanser, lite lotion, lip sunscreen, and ointment on feet and elbows. It makes the skin  soft and smooth, and calms irritation. Thank you so much for that. 
I have a very oily T zone and blackheads on nose and chin. 
I'd also like to just smoothen out the texture of my skin if that makes sense. It feels very textured, and I see many people posting such clear skin.
I'm not sure how to achieve this. [deleted] >Really interesting! We are skin twins! Can you let me know when you find a cleanser that works well for you? Please and thank you, thank you and please?! Thank you so much!! The ''regular'' moisturizer from Vanicream is pretty moisturizing.  I'm going to try the light version...summer is coming and when I have a moisturizer that is too heavy while it's hot, I tend to get millia's.  Those things suck!  I think that during the day, lite vanicream and sunscreen should be OK.  Thanks for letting me know how you feel about the light version! Yes, I can‚Äôt use it on my face because it‚Äôs so sticky and heavy. This is something I've wondered for myself as well- personally I'm new to a lot of this, but I'm trying to determine if the CCs on my cheeks are actually KP...I'm sort of thinking they are...they always have been there, just as the KP on my arms has. The only difference is that I pick at the roughness and bumps on my arms and have left bad scarring, whereas I've left my cheeks alone. Fellow sensitive skin gal here, I also have KP. I have successfully used Rationale‚Äôs B serum (#1) and ASAP‚Äôs B serum without any bumps on my face. I have KP on my arms (used to creep up on my face before I started tretinoin) and on my arms im having success with a very low pH wash with lactic acid (it's actually a feminine hygiene wash with pH of 3.8) and a basic lotion with no oils, no ceramides, and no niacinamide. 

Niacinamide also makes my face feel like on fire so I never really gave it a second chance.


Edit: I use a chemical exfoliant every now and then (using up whatever didn't work on my face) physically scrubbing at it is very very rare like once a month. It seems to get better with lots of hydration to soften the bumps Everybody's body is different Yeah CeraVe doesn't work for me. I replaced Cerave products with vanicream (gentle facial cleanser and the cream for my body) and my skin is so much happier. I love Krave Beauty‚Äôs Matcha Hemp Cleanser ($16) its great for dry skin! or Glossier‚Äôs Milk Jelly Cleanser ($18) both really good options.


I have extremely dry skin and I never wash my face in the morning. Only double cleansing at night starting with an oil cleanser/remover of some kind It‚Äôs like when you put on a product and it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs peeling off your face. Like little balls of the product form. I learned the word here. So I could be wrong hahahaü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sorry you had a reaction to it. Good luck ! üòÖüòÖüòÖ The micellar range is fab, and so hydrating. I use the micellar face wash by garnier and it‚Äôs fab! May have to try these suggestions in my routine. Thanks so much for your help! I love the vanicream face cleanser. I used to use the cetaphil gentle cleanser and tolerated it ok, but my skin seems much happier since I switched to vanicream. I‚Äôll have to give the lite lotion a try, I use the vanicream moisturizing cream on my hands but the high amount of petrolatum makes it annoyingly sticky. [deleted] If I ever find it I‚Äôll certainly let you know! Ugh. I'm starting tret soon and I'm trying to find a good moisturizer. I use Aveeno positively radiant now but I feel like it won't be moisturizing enough when I start tret. I get it on my jawline, neck, and chest as well as arms. The only time i've had it on my cheeks is when i use niacinamide products. I feel like it's the same way that a product may cause breakouts for some acne prone people and is a miracle product for others. Not all KP sufferers react the same. I was just sharing my personal experience. I have KP on my arms and on my face.  For arms I use the Dermadoctor KP scrub 2x a week and the Eucerin rough and bumpy arms lotion everyday. For face, TO niacinamide irritated my KP and acne.  What helped my KP was TO glycolic toner 2x to 3x a week and TO azelaic acid. Love the matcha hemp cleanser! That‚Äôs interesting because the Cetaphil cleanser works better for me than Vanicream. Just goes to show everyone‚Äôs skin is different My skin responds well to Vanicream. Cetaphil  regular cleanser broke me out.  After being more attentive to reading labels , I wasn‚Äôt that impressed by the formula. Though I really like the Cetaphil Derma Pro SPH  30 moisturizer for oily skin.  Currently, my new obsession is Japanese sunscreens and skincare. Rabbit hole: activated. üòÅ [deleted] Totally!! Really appreciate the feedback, it‚Äôs so helpful to have different perspectives. We‚Äôre all trying to figure out what works best for our various individual circumstances. Happy Easter üê£ The glycolic acid is also on my list to try! [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Hey, y‚Äôall! I know this sub is inundated with shelfie posts, but I‚Äôm so happy to finally have a routine that leaves me closed comedone and acne free, I wanted to share it on the off chance it could help someone else. I have been scouring this sub and r/AsianBeauty for years trying to put together my perfect routine, and I think I‚Äôve done it! I have combination skin and have occasional breakouts. As always, YMMV.

I'll go from left to right, which is also my routine order...

* ***Cleanser:*** I only use cleanser at night. In the morning, I just rinse my face with water. I rotate between using the **Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser** and the **Cerave Hydrating Cleanser**. I usually use the foaming version in the spring/summer, and the hydrating version in the fall/winter, when I can use all of the hydration I can get. The foaming version is very much a traditional cleanser, and it leaves your skin feeling clean without the "tightness" that some cleansers cause. The hydrating version feels... very odd the first time you use it. It is creamy, and does not leave your skin with the traditional "clean" feeling. It almost feels like you are cleansing with a moisturizer. But, rest assured, it's doing it's job, and if you suffer from dry skin, it is a great alternative for other cleansers. You can find these online or at your local grocery/drug store, and they are very affordable (\~$13 for a 16oz bottle on Amazon).
* ***Actives:*** I have three actives in my lineup, but they are not all a part of my daily routine. As always, when starting actives, GO SLOW! I had terrible reactions due to over exfoliation toward the beginning of my journey that took months to recover from. It's not worth it. I use actives at night after cleansing.
   * ***BHA:*** I use this active daily, except when using AHA. Once my face has air-dried after cleansing, I use 1-2 pads to wipe my face, and then wait \~15 minutes before moving on to the next step. I read about **Stridex in the red box** on this sub for years, but I never tried it. Instead, I used a few different BHAs that used white willow bark instead of salicylic acid. I just assumed that they had the same effect. The white willow bark BHA helped to clear up some of my acne, but I still had an army of stubborn closed comedones on my forehead. A couple of months ago, I ran out of my usual BHA and had forgotten to reorder. I ran to CVS and picked up a box of Stridex to hold me over. Holy. Shit. This stuff changed my skin in the best way. Within just 3 days of daily use, my closed comedones were COMPLETELY GONE! I was emotional, as I had spent years trying to get rid of them, only for this dirt cheap product to make them disappear. If you use a white willow bark BHA, still struggle with some skin issues, and have never tried salicylic acid, I highly recommend that you do so. You can find it at CVS or Walmart at \~$5 for a box of 90 pads.
   * ***AHA:*** I use this active 1-2 times per week after cleansing. On nights that I use AHA, I do not use BHA. After applying, I wait \~15 minutes before moving on to the next step. I have been using the **Mizon AHA 8% Peeling Serum** for a few years. I tried a few other types of acid but found that I like glycolic the best, and I like how this particular formulation feels when putting it on. For me, it is a tried and true product that gets rid of PIH quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth the next day. I heard that they were discontinuing it a year or two ago, but I have still been able to find it (not expired) on Amazon at an affordable price (\~$18 for a 40ml bottle).
   * ***Vitamin C:*** I use this active almost daily (sometimes I forget or am lazy). I apply it after waiting the \~15 minutes for my AHA/BHA. Once applied, I wait another \~15 minutes before moving on to the next step. There are sooo many different vitamin C formulations out there, but the **Rohto Melano CC Anti-Spot Essence** is one that I have come back to after trying out others and finding them lacking. The packaging is ingenious; it is an opaque tube with an opening big enough for only one drop at a time. This means that it will not oxidize before you use every last drop. You don't even need to keep it in the fridge! It is efficient in fading PIH, and it also gives my skin a "glowy" feeling. You can find it on Amazon at an affordable price (\~$25 for a two-pack, 40ml total).
* ***Serum:*** I use this on my wet face in the morning after rinsing with water. I have classified the **Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion** as a serum, as it is not a lotion in any sense of the English word. It works beautifully in the place of a hyaluronic acid serum. It traps any moisture on your face and leaves it feeling so hydrated. It‚Äôs a very simple product, yet it‚Äôs extremely effective. I have found that when I use it on my dry face, it does not work as well. You can find it on Amazon, and it is very affordable (\~$13 for a 170ml bottle).
* ***Ampoule:*** I use this morning and night after the serum/active(s), respectively. The **Scinic Honey All in One Ampoule** is one of my favorite products in my routine. It smells so nice, and it is just fun to put on. It is thicker than a serum, and some people have found it to be sticky, but I as long as I pat it in until it is absorbed, it is not a problem for me. It is 90% honey extract and niacinamide is the 4th ingredient. It plumps up my skin and makes it feel brighter. This is the most expensive product in my routine at \~$25, but it comes in a 250ml jar that lasts months. You can find it on Amazon. **EDIT:** I have been informed that this is being discontinued ):
* ***Spot Treatment:*** I use this once per day after the ampoule, usually in the morning, only if I have a pimple (and only on the pimple). I then wait \~15 minutes before moving on to the next step. **Acne.org‚Äôs 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide** is my holy grail spot treatment. When used over a serum/ampoule, it does not dry out my skin and gets rid of acne twice as fast. Research has shown that the 2.5% works just as well as the 10% and is less harsh. Be warned that it does stain fabric! I missed that part when I first started using it and ruined my pillowcases. Worth it. I‚Äôm sure that other BP products work just as well, but this is only \~$20 for a giant 8oz tube. You can find it on acne.org.
* ***Moisturizer:*** I use this morning and night after the ampoule/spot treatment (if used). I tried r/skincareaddiction‚Äôs favorite, Cerave in the tub, but it caused a terrible breakout. So, I was apprehensive to try **Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**. I‚Äôm glad I did! I love this stuff (as do most of you), and it did not cause the breakouts that the tub did. It‚Äôs packed with niacinamide, ceramides; shit, y‚Äôall already know the deal. It‚Äôs my HG moisturizer and, thankfully, it‚Äôs affordable (\~$23 on Amazon for a two-pack, 6oz total).
* ***Sunscreen:*** I use this in the morning after moisturizing. As a filthy ginger, this is the most important part of my routine. I actually started out using **Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence**, and I love it so much that I haven‚Äôt bothered to really try other products. It goes on so smooth, does not have a white cast, is not greasy, and has SPF 50+/PA++++. If you don‚Äôt know about Asian sunscreens, I suggest you look into them. They provide much better UV protection and are just more cosmetically elegant. It is so hydrating, and if I didn‚Äôt know any better, I would think it was a moisturizer. And at \~$30 for a pack of three 1.76oz bottles, it is pretty affordable for such a powerful product! People with darker skin might not need this much protection, but it is definitely worth it for me. Now *this* is how to do a shelfie post! I‚Äôm loving the detailed reviews :)

I‚Äôm really tempted to buy melano cc, the only thing putting me off is the texture - how do you find it sinks in/layers with subsequent products?  Oh my gosh that honey ampoule looks just like a real honey jar, too cute! Ugh. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but SCINIC seems to have discontinued all its AIOs except for the centella one.  I need a tiny shrub
 This contains many of my holy grails, I might try straight up copying you. Thank u for the post OP After I saw your review within 5 minute I bought the vitamin c serum! Hope it works as well on me too!  The hadalabo/scinic honey has been an HG combination for me too! Your shelf looks a lot like mine so I might have to check out the vitamin C serum you used! Holy crap, little bit of a flashback with the Stridex. Glad it works for you, but that stuff broke me out so bad as a teen. My dad used to make me use it (knew nothing about skincare, just knew I had acne and it was to treat it). Funny to hear of another person who alternates between hydrating and foaming cleanser. I find that using the foaming at night and hydrating in the morning was perfect for me.   Thank you SO much for posting a routine that is actually accessible!! I loved this. 

I just wanted to mention- careful buying cosmetics and skincare on Amazon. Anyone can sell anything on Amazon, meaning that a company can create a counterfeit product, throw it in fake packaging, and sell it as Cerave or Biore or whatever. If possible, go to the brand‚Äôs own website or an authorized retailer.  (I sell on amazon and have had my own products counterfeit. Amazon is VERY slow to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù, because they make the same commission on fakes.) I just switched to the cereve pm lotion and am in love with it. I just ordered the ordinary aha bha thing so I'm excited to give it a try. I don't have much in terms of acne, but I have been trying to reduce my pore size and get better skin texture.  Congratulations! I hope I can find mine sooner :(

Been doing trial & error since mid 2018. I‚Äôve only found a good cleanser and toner. During the trial & errors, I figured my face hates most, if not all, moisturizers I‚Äôve tried I feel like I‚Äôm glowing more just looking at this picture.   I really want to try the Scinic Honey Ampoule, but I wish I could find it sold in stores.  At the beginning of my skincare journey I never would have thought it would take so long to find those tried and true products, that just work. But 3yrs in and I get it. 

I have a few staples however, discontinued products do my head in.  Wow I so appreciate your post! These are great reviews and you have totally sold me on buying some stridex pads! It is now on my amazon wishlist since I don‚Äôt have any salicylic acid in my routine right now. I‚Äôm so sad that the CeraVe in the tub didn‚Äôt work for you bc I‚Äôm loving it so much, but definitely singing the praises of the CeraVe PM, too! I have saved your post and plan to refer back to it bc I want to try all the products in your routine üôÉ thanks again for sharing!! Thanks thank you for sharing. I think I have similar skin and stubborn acne. Think I'm almost through my purge and it's been brutal. Sorry, I'm a newbie but what is aha vs bha? I'm so nervous to reintroduce sacilic acid and benzoyl peroxide as a 30 yr old but perhaps it's necessary. I've been trying to just get by with tea tree oil.  Does the stridex sacilic acid stain like BP?? I really want to about BP üò¨. I have some of the other products you use as well so I'm going I clear up soon I use the Cereve foaming cleanser and I think in the colder .months, I'd do better with the hydrating wash. Also, I saw the Cereve PM lotion and bought a PM one in a small jar ( purple label). Its thick and I think may be causing some breakouts.  The other Cereve moisturizing lotion works well for my skin.

Thanks for showing what you use! So glad to know about this sunscreen! I have very oil skin and usually avoid things with sunscreen because it seems so greasy. Will definitely give this a try! Where did you get the melano cc?  I want to buy it but I can only find it on amazon and I‚Äôm worried about quality. Love love love that CeraVe cleanser! Honey extract? Right there with you on 4 of those!!!  Genuinely happy for you, this is such a treasure.  Would you say the Hada Labo serum would be effective to use as a moisturizer in and of itself? My face is on the dry side, but I don‚Äôt like moisturizers that feel slimy or too thick like lotions (currently use Neutrogena HydroBoost water gel because it absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel plump, but it‚Äôs crazy $$)  No matter what I tried I cannot get used to the hydrating cleanser. It‚Äôs like lotion in the shower...on your face. Doesn‚Äôt make me feel clean at all. I use the foaming cleanser and just make sure I put on extra moisturizer afterwards (at least in the winter).  [deleted] I love this! Can comment on three of the products:

Stridex - bought this for my sister mainly but I use it from time to time. Not sure it‚Äôs working as well as I expected‚Äîmakes my face red and dry (I do use adapalene + BP at night). I find that I am able to tolerate an AHA more (Pixi) so that‚Äôs the only acid I use 3x/week. 

Hada Labo Premium - a bottle lasted for a year on me (2x daily use). I mistakenly bought the Milk version next and I thought I‚Äôd return it‚Äîgave it a try and IMO it‚Äôs the better version!!!! It‚Äôs not as sticky as the lotion and it‚Äôs almost the same consistency as my main moisturiser below. 

Cerave PM - Just ordered my 4th bottle :) Found out about this gem last year, tried it and well...I am probably going to use this for the rest of my life.  Stridex pads are the only thing good to me in this world.  I've just started using stridex and it's amazing. Doesn't irritate my skin at all. 

And raw honey has been doing wonders for my hyperpigmentation 

Thanks for sharing, I'll have to give some of these a try  THANK YOU for all this detail! This is precisely what I needed! I have two of these already, the rest are now in my Amazon cart awaiting payday. üòÑ I haven‚Äôt had the pleasure of using any of the others but the biore sunscreen is amazing. I haven‚Äôt been able to find a competitor since i found this! Uck I‚Äôm in the middle of trying to do this! Well done In regards to the sunscreen, do you find it makes a good last step before applying makeup? Or do you still have to use a primer?(no offense meant if you don‚Äôt wear makeup!). I‚Äôve been trying to find a good sunscreen/primer combo! red stridex gang I seek the Holy Grail [deleted] Woohoo!! Another Melano CC fan ü§óü§ó What a great routine! I love many of these products! I am happy to hear about your success with Stridex. I have stubborn CC's on my cheek that wont budge so maybe I will run out and get myself some Stridex! :) Thank you for selflessly taking the time to go into detail. I‚Äôm new to this thread and really trying to venture out. I thought i knew skincare until i met you wonderful people.  First off, u/kbuoy , thanks so much for sharing this detailed post!  The shelfie is lovely.

Second, I'd like to ask you how you went about adding so many actives in your routine.  I'm also a ginger, and my skin tends towards combination/dehydrated/sensitive.  My skin's chemistry is quick to upset, and while I love how Stridex (red box) handles my troublesome CCs, using it every night is too much for me right now, even with a routine that is very heavily centered around moisturizing.  It's my goal to someday be able to use a BHA and an AHA in my routine in the same week.  What are some tips you have about working these actives into your routine to avoid drying out your skin?  I appreciate any wisdom you or others have to offer \^\^ I'm so glad the stridex works for you! I loved how they made my pimps none existant and exfoliated my skin. Had to stop bc I think I have mild rosacea so they'd really make my face light up, it looked great under makeup though. Now I'm struggling to find something to get rid of my dead skin that won't make me turn red :/ I‚Äôm just curious as to why some people do t wash their faces in the morning? I‚Äôm in esthetician school and being taught that it‚Äôs better to use active serums and oils at night since your skin is repairing itself at night but with not washing your face in the morning is boggling to me. To me it‚Äôs like rinsing your hands with water and not using soap. You‚Äôve rinsed yes, but all the bacteria is still there. What does it achieve? I‚Äôm interested. I thought you weren't supposed to use vit c with niacinamide?? What is your routine? Do you just rinse off with water or do you year any other products? Hey thanks so much for all your reviews! I have a question, why do you use the BHA and AHA on separate days? I heard it was ideal to use BHA and then AHA right after but in a newb so I'm curious. Also just clarifying, are the stridex pads AHA? I'm curious about getting them for my chest pimples/CC but idk if it would help. Also, I use AHA and BHA like 2-3 times a week. I want to add in melano CC daily, but I'm nervous about adding on another active even though my skin doesn't seem dehydrated. Would you suggest adding it in like once a week at first? 
Also, the Hada labo is ok to put on after actives correct?
Thank you soooo so soooo much in advance if you answer these questions! Sending love ‚ù§Ô∏è The hadalabo is a toner to be honest, not a serum. Do the parabens in the CerVe concern you? Its been proven parabens caused cell destruction when exposed to sun light.  I feel like the only one who can use nothing but water and lotion. I've been trying for just as long as you and one of the first products I started with was that cerave cleanser + stridex pads and it was just horrible. It took me forever to figure out that those things don't belong on my face.  If you ever get a chance, plant Aloe and try using that and incorporate that! That‚Äôs all I use and it‚Äôs the best thing ever! It saves me so much money from when I used like 8 different facial lotions, masks, scrubs etc... and now I just use the plant.  ***Honorable mentions:*** There are a few products I use every once in awhile that I really like. I didn‚Äôt feel that they belonged in my routine, but they do hold a place on my shelf. I have tried several products from The Ordinary, but found all of them to be pretty mediocre. However, I really enjoy the **AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution**. I use it very sparingly, maybe once or twice a month, but it is a great and extremely affordable chemical peel ($7.20 for a 30ml bottle!!). For moisturizers, I also love **Stratia‚Äôs Liquid Gold**, but at $24 for a 60ml bottle, I can‚Äôt bring myself to use it daily. I will occasionally use it before my main moisturizer when I want some extra plumpness to my skin. It is such an incredible product, I‚Äôm just a cheapskate. And last, a recent addition to my shelf, the **COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask**. I love this product as my final step at night. It feels so silky and brightens up my skin almost instantly. Sometimes I even use it during the day for some extra moisturization. At \~$11 for a 60ml bottle on Amazon, it is pretty affordable, but I haven‚Äôt decided if I can classify it as a HG yet.

Whew, sorry for the novel, but I hope I included all of the information you could want from a shelfie post. If you have any questions about these products or anything else, shoot your shot! I‚Äôm here to help. I‚Äôm also here procrastinating writing a paper, which is ironic, because I just wrote a whole paper for you guys.

Much love,

Katy This was such a thoughtful review, thank you for posting!! Would you mind sharing where you purchase the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence? I‚Äôve been dying to try it but there seems to be lots of shady sellers on Amazon. >People with darker skin might not need this much protection...

Ooh, yes we do. o_o Totally agree with you about sunscreen , I just try it today but It surprised me completely. Seems like it more or less transparent when I apply it and I feel like I was applying moisturizer instead of sunscreen, and my skin felt relaxing also with that I guess. Hope my skin get along with it well then I definitely use it all the time. We have a lot of the same products, but I‚Äôm still searching for my holy grail sunscreen and haven‚Äôt tried this one yet. I use CeraVe Ultralight AM. My skin loves it, but it leaves me too shiny. It‚Äôs fine under foundation, but I don‚Äôt want to wear foundation everyday.  How‚Äôs the finish on the Biore? Looking for something matte. I‚Äôm naturally shiny (not greasy, even clean skin shines) and need something that doesn‚Äôt amplify that! Thanks! Thank you so much for all the detail here! I've been debating if I should use vit c after my AHA and now I'm going to give it a try Oh wow this is very similar to what I want to incorporate! Do you use the Vit C in the PM?  Looks exactly like what I need, I got some of the same things. I get dry tight skin in the winter, not much problems in the summer. That Hada Labo Premium is HG for me. I LOVE it. In japan and Korea lotion is referring to what we call toner btw! :) also I read the comments and scinic AIO is being discontinued?! I‚Äôm so sad I love it too! My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù I recently figured out was I can wear it during the day! I would start looking mega jaundice but the end of the day and thought it was foundation oxidizing or something but it was on days I wore no makeup too so definitely my skin! Once I took the scinic AIO out of my morning routine my skin looked the same at night as it did in the morning. I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone else having this issue though! Can you use the melano cc essence everyday?  Question lol, so I was on the acne.org regimen for a while and gave up but this makes me want to go and look into my spot treatment tube. Do you have or did you have cystic acne?  So are the Stridex your toner pads or just another level of cleaning after your first cleanser? The texture is amazing; there is no texture!! It's a tad bit oily at first, but that helps with putting it on, and it totally sinks in after 15 minutes. I have had no issues with pilling when putting on subsequent products. The texture is a huge part of what made me come back to it after trying products like TO 23% and Timeless. I know, right? It's the whole package, effective and cute. Damn, really? That must be why it's gotten so hard to find... My second choice for this type of thicker hydration is the Cosrx Snail 96, so I guess I'll have to go back to that! Bittersweet news! The Honey AIO has been on my wish list for some time, but I guess I won't get to try it. At least I didn't fall in love with a discontinued item. Ahh I‚Äôm so confused! I literally just went and bought it on amazon after seeing OPs review of it here! Does that mean I bought a fake? It was kind of pricey so I hope not but I just checked and it was for sure the scinic honey all in one ampule, looks just like OPs selfie photo so I‚Äôm confused?!  Really? I see it for sale on Amazon for $38.90.  The ASIN is B00STAV016.  Maybe I am looking at the wrong thing.  My fat cat loves to chew on it, it's half the size that it was haha. Copy away! May you find your HG routine swiftly and with no bad reactions üôèüôè I hope so!! I really love it. The grittiness of the other vitamins C serums I have tried have really thrown me off. This one has the perfect texture! So bummed to learn the Scinic honey has been discontinued. My HG routine is already fucked haha. The vitamin C is great! Definitely the best LAA formulation I've found. That's so disappointing! Do you use a SA now? For sure! I always make sure to check the seller reviews and only buy from sellers who have a 95-100% with at least a few hundred reviews. Haven't had a problem in the past 5 years luckily! The chemical peel can definitely help with texture! Just be careful and follow the directions (don't leave it on for more than 10 minutes or use it more than once or twice a week), chemical burns suck! It definitely takes time! Keep at it. Is there a particular ingredient that you're sensitive to? Do you break out from moisturizers? I‚Äôve found my face produces too much oil (at least in this period of my life) so I live off the stridex redpads. I only moisturize under my eyes before bed. Been doing this for months and no wrinkles. [this](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Avalon-Organics-Intense-Defense-Eye-Cream-1-oz/12167363) is the eye cream I like. Avalon organic also makes a face lotion I‚Äôll use once a month during my cycle when my face goes from the tar pits into the sahara desert. /u/AliceLid just informed me it was discontinued ): You might still be able to find it for a few months online! I found it gave me breakouts :( I have an almost full jar now expired because I couldn‚Äôt use it. I know, right? I started in 2013 with Asian beauty products. Had my heart broken so many times, they discontinue and reformulate everything! For the Stridex, I was going to buy mine on Amazon but the price is quite inflated when compared to in-store prices unless you are buying 3 containers. I picked mine up at Dollar General for $3-4 for a box of 70 pads. So if possible, I would look for them in a store. I‚Äôm not sure where you are so ik that may not be possible, but thought I‚Äôd say it anywho b/c everyone loves to save a few dollars! I wish the tub worked for my face, so much product for so little money. But I do LOVE it as a body moisturizer! Hope the salicylic acid gives your face that lil extra something like it did mine! Hey! First, my acne has never been severe, so I don't want to mislead you into thinking that these are miracle products! Your mileage may vary with all skincare products (meaning different things work/don't work for different people). Salicylic acid is a BHA and an AHA is something like glycolic acid (although there are different types of acids that are classified as AHAs, some people find that some work better than others for their skin). BHA essentially unclogs pores and can help prevent acne, while AHA helps to get rid of the marks left over after a breakout and also removes dead skin cells. Do not be afraid to use these products because of your age! I'm 26 and will not be getting rid of them anytime in the forseeable future. Stridex (and salicylic acid in general) does not stain like BP. Tea tree oil has actually been found to be a good substitute for BP, it just takes longer to see the results. BP is the quintessential acne product and is super effective at clearing up breakouts quickly. As long as you don't use too much/too high of a concentration, it will not dry you out, especially if you put it on over your moisturizer. On [acne.org](https://acne.org), they recommend using it all over your face daily to prevent breakouts, but I do not have any personal experience with that. Hope all of this helps! You might have gotten the night cream. That is different from the PM lotion; I haven't tried it! The lotion is definitely thinner than a cream. And yes, the hydrating cleanser is great for the cold months! 

You're so welcome :) I know what you mean, greasy sunscreens are the worst! Every American and European sunscreen I have tried was too greasy for me, but Asian sunscreens are on a whole different level! I get mine from Amazon. Just check the seller ratings; as long as they have a 95-100% with a few hundred reviews, I wouldn't worry too much. Amazon is great about refunds/replacements if it never arrives. It can take a while since it's coming from Japan! Yep, thats the first ingredient! Not entirely sure what that means haha, but it's not actual honey (it's not thick and sticky). Maybe just honey with the sugar and other things removed? I don't think so, not unless your skin doesn't require much moisturization. It's more of a product that works well as a hydrating layer, at least for me. It is also a bit slimy as you apply it, so if that is a turnoff for you, you might not like it! Have you tried the Cerave PM? It goes on very light (one word that comes to mind for me is "whipped"), but it is still extremely moisturizing. It's not thick or slimy, and would be good if you're only looking to use one product! Yeah, it is definitely a \*weird\* feeling. Once I got over the fact that it didn't leave me with that traditional "clean" feeling, I was able to appreciate it! Oh no! If it causes a bad reaction for your skin, don't use it!! Some products just don't work for some people. A lot of this sub's most touted products cause horrible reactions for my skin! Maybe try a more gentle salicylic acid product? Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA is recommended often. 

You really only need to have wait times when using actives (AHA, BHA, Vitamin C) so they have time to do their work on bare skin. No need to wait in between cleansing and moisturizing! [deleted] I've heard about the milk but never tried it! I like having something thinner than my main moisturizer for hydration. My skin gets dehydrated so easily üò™ Hey! I don't wear makeup, so I can't tell you how it wears under foundation. I'm sorry! Maybe Google has answers? üö®üö®üö® Well, they are different products with different ingredients/benefits, but the honey ampoule has apparently been discontinued, so I would avoid it. You don't want to risk falling in love with a discontinued product! If you're looking to add another hydrating layer, I also like the Cosrx Snail 96 essence for the thicker type of hydration that the ampoule gives. Yes! It's so cheap, definitely worth a try. Hope it helps!! No prob! I definitely did not incorporate all of the actives at once. I started off used a vitaman C serum, and then introduced an AHA a few months later. Used the AHA recklessly at the beginning and ruined my skin for a few months (don't do this), so now I use it only once or twice a week. The BHA I was originally using didn't even have any acid in it, it was willow bark based, so it was extremely weak and never caused a problem. By the time I introduced Stridex, my skin knew what was up.

If you are already using Stridex (BHA) regularly, you should be fine to introduce vitamin C. Though it is an active, in my experience, it does not have the same harsh effect as acids. I dont think you can over exfoliate with vitamin C, though someone correct me if I'm wrong. Before adding AHA, I'd try to get the BHA sorted first. If it is irritating to use it daily, maybe try once every other day or every two days and go from there. When you are ready, I would start by using AHA once a week, and skip BHA the day before, of, and after to be safe. You could also try a gentler acid to start, like mandelic or lactic, if you want to play it extra safe! Good luck!! I'm sorry! I know that rosacea can be a struggle. I hope you can figure it out! Since I wash my face before bed, I don't feel that it gets dirty while I sleep (I wash my sheets and pillowcases regularly), so I don't feel the need to wash it again when I wake up. As I said at the beginning of the post though, YMMV, so if others want to wash their face in the morning and it works for them, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that! They're ok to use together, but some people may experience some irritation or flushing. I'm sadly one of those who flush, so I use any products with vit C in the morning and any products with niacinamide at night. I've heard conflicting info about that, but I haven't had a problem with it, and [Paula](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/myths/can-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-be-used-together.html) says it's okay! Did you mean to comment on someone's reply? Hey, it's actually strongly recommended NOT to use AHA and BHA on the same days, especially not one after the other! That is too much exfoliation for most people, and will result in a ruined moisture barrier and a bad breakout due to overexfoliation. That being said, if you're already doing that and it works for you, then whatever. But if you are just starting out, please do not do that! It will almost surely fuck up your skin and take forever to recuperate.

The Stridex is BHA and is commonly recommended for body acne. Just swipe them over clean skin.

Melano CC is a vitamin C serum, which is not as harsh as AHA or BHA. Definitely add in once a week and work up from there. Once every day or every 2 days is ideal.

Yep, totally fine to put the Hada Labo on after an active, but make sure you are letting your active (AHA, BHA, or vitamin C) sit on your face for 10-15 minutes before putting anything else on for the best effect. And once you are ready to use the Hada Labo, wet your face a bit, as it is a hyaluronic acid product and works better when it has hydration to trap onto the skin. Due to its thickness and moisturizing properties, I think that the best way to describe it is as a serum. When I think of a toner, I (and I think most would) think of something like Thayers. Definitely wish that worked for me, I would save so much money! Glad you found something cheap and effective that works for you!! Nice! I'm not a big fan of putting aloe on my face as it always seems to dry me out, but it's def great for sunburns! You didn't ask for advice on how to work around the honey container but once you use up your liquid gold, wash out the container. I put my scinic honey in there and having a pump makes it 100x easier to work with. Love the shelfie! Lmfao you‚Äôre supposed to be writing a paper right now????? Where you lost time on your paper, we‚Äôve gained knowledge, thank you for the sacrifice. 

& my forehead gets shinny & glistens with oil by midday-afternoon, would these products help with it? I‚Äôm definitely going to be trying out the sunscreen & vitamin c! I need to enhance my routine & ima steal from yours ^ I just read some reviews on the Cosrx overnight rice mask. (I know I murdered the name but I‚Äôm on mobile. I really need to use that excuse more in life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, officer. I‚Äôm on mobile.‚Äù) It is of note that the product contains niacinamide and if you have a sensitivity to that ingredient, well, beware. I, so far, do not know if I am sensitive to the niacinamide and added that stuff to my amazon cart! 
Thanks for the great reviews, Katy! I appreciate people like you!  Do you know if they discontinued he Scinic AIO? I have had a hard time looking for it on Amazonas they removed it from Jolse a while back too.  I actually get it on Amazon! Have been ordering it on there for years and have never had a problem. Just be sure to check the seller's ratings! As long as they have a bunch of reviews and are in the 95-100% range, I wouldn't worry. If you happen to live in Southern California, or other area that has a lot of Asian people, you can pick it up from one of the beauty stores here. Got mine for I think $11? or was it $14. I forget, but it was cheap. I usually buy on eBay instead of Amazon.  Look for a trusted seller with good reviews. Haha fair enough! I only have experience as a ginger. When my parents would forget to put sunscreen on me as a kid, I would get second-degree burns (giant blisters) after a few hours outside üòñ So I'm super careful now. I hope it works for you too! I know that some people who are sensitive to alcohol have had problems, but it is my favorite for sure! Not OP, but I use Biore on days that I wear powder foundation, and Austrialian Gold SPF50 tinted on days that I don‚Äôt and AG dries incredibly matte!   Biore makes several sunscreens that dry super matte. My HG is Biore‚Äôs Perfect Milk; it dries down very quickly with a very matte finish. The only drawback is that it comes in teeny-tiny bottles. The first time I ordered one, I thought I‚Äôd been shipped a travel-size bottle by mistake. But no, that‚Äôs the size it is.  It's definitely not shiny... I'd say it dries semi-matte? It definitely doesn't add shininess, but I'm not sure that it covers it up much either. I'll give you a more definite answer when I finish my morning routine!

Edit: Yep, doesn't add to the shine but doesn't cover it up. I feel like it is more beneficial because you just removed some dead skin so it absorbs more effectively (this is all in my head with 0% research to back it up haha). I do like to gently wipe my face off with a wet cloth after letting the AHA do its work if I'm going to use vit c. I find that the vit c slightly pills if I don't, I'm not sure if it's the dead skin or the two products reacting. I do! I use actives in the PM (whenever I wash my face). But that's just personal preference! BHA you can use in the AM and vit C is actually supposed to be more beneficial in the AM as it provides a small amount of UV protection (NOT a substitute for sunscreen). AHA makes your skin more sensitive to the sun though, so it's recommended that you use that one at night (and then load up on sunscreen the next day). Same here! I even get a bit of eczema around my nose and eyes during the winter, but I've found that the hydrating layers keep it from flaring up too much. Yeah, to me, toner is a bad way to describe it to others since it is so thick and moisturizing! When I think of a toner, I think of something watery and clarifying like Thayers. I didn't want people to be misled and think it was a traditional Western "toner", as it really acts like what we would call a serum.

That is so weird!! I wonder what is causing the color? It goes on colorless for me. Maybe it was reacting with another product in your routine? You definitely can! It's not harsh like an acid; I would recommend using it once a day for the best results üëç I did have some trouble with cystic acne before I got on birth control. I would say that, for the cystic acne, the BP did help reduce some swelling and sped up the recovery process, but definitely did not get rid of it completely. Unfortunately, mine was hormonal, which was only cured with hormonal birth control. Hope this helps! Neither! Stridex is actually a BHA (salicylic acid), which is an acid that unclogs pores and helps prevent acne and blackheads from popping up. There are more cosmetically elegant salicylic acid products (Paula's Choice is an example), Stridex is just cheap, and I am a sucker for cheap haha. Awesome, thank you!  I use Aqua and I‚Äôm still looking for a replacement :( I‚Äôm going to try the much touted Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence.  Falling in love with discontinued items is the AB struggle :'( They‚Äôre selling old inventory. You‚Äôre fine. But yeah, they‚Äôve been jacking up the price now that it‚Äôs discontinued.  Yeah. As I said, selling off inventory at inflated prices. It used to be $15.  I got jealous so I went out and bought a [tiny plant](https://i.imgur.com/iSiPFZl.png) Good to know! I also just bought the biore sunscreen! I‚Äôm kinda kicking myself for not trying it sooner especially I grew up in Asia and been using biore product all my life.  Quick question! I always read to put vitamin c on a clean face and then the toner. Is that wrong?! No. Nothing with that in it ever worked for me. I finally found a good routine though.. 15 years later :) Good call!! Lots of people forget to check seller reviews. Glad you haven‚Äôt had problems. :) thanks again for the great review Yeah :( learned the hard way :( My face worsen when I jumped on the bandwagon of doing an all-klairs routine then followed it by laneige :( I thought it was *that* easy. stupid me.

You know what? That‚Äôs also one of the questions I find difficult to answer :( I think it‚Äôs *this* and *that* but never really sure of :/  YEEEEEES! üò≠
My face, too!!! I‚Äôm super oily! Maybe that‚Äôs why using CosRX pimple pad every routine doesn‚Äôt sting or iritate my skin.
I‚Äôm doing that, too! I use Innisfree eye cream.
How heavy is Avalon? Whaaaat why would they do this to us??? üò≠ do you have any plans for a replacement? I have been using the regular hada labo "lotion"


HADALABO Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074GX619Q/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_NKMtCb5FNQ6ZY

Have you tried it? If so how does it compare to the orange bottle one? If the that is better I might have to grab some soon since hadalabo usually takes like 3 weeks to show up  Thank you for the recommendation! The amazon prices did seem a little high, I‚Äôll have to go to target or someplace instead. I did buy the renewing night cream. I'll finish it up because it is really thick and I need moisture in the cold weather. And it's a small jar. Also, it's possible that my breakouts are from indulging in sugary foods.  Thank you for your descriptive response and breakdown! I‚Äôm pretty sure I did try the Cerave PM at some point, but it may do me well to give it another chance now that I‚Äôm having to cut my budget! I‚Äôll keep the essence in mind for future trials in my HG hunt :) Congratulations on finding yours at last! [deleted] Hi, the product listing just said Hada Labo Premium, which is why I bought it‚Äîonly found out that it‚Äôs not the lotion I was used to when I received it. 

One thing I will bear in mind when I repurchase is that the lotion is 170ml while the milk is 140 ml. :) Thanks so much!  This sounds like safe advice.  I'm pretty impatient when it comes to skin care, so pacing myself is difficult when there are so many things to try lol. Thank you :)  I meant to ask what is your morning routine, because you said you just wash with water-no cleanser. I didn't know if you skipped all  products completely in the AM Thank you SO much. It says on the Paula's choice website said you can use them one after another üò¨ Idk where I got the idea that using the AHA right after BHA makes it better? But I'm so happy I saw your post because certainly it must be better NOT to do that. Thankfully it was BHA and lactic acid and I only did it a few times together haha. I will start alternating now. What's your schedule for alternating your AHA and BHA use? Do you use vit c in mornings and then another active at night is that ok? 
Thanks so much for your advice you probably saved my skin!! üíñüíñ it's so tricky sometimes I cringe thinking how when I was younger I just threw shit on my face lol   That's true, but the Japanese name their toners as lotions, like the Kikumasamune high moist lotion, they come in different consistencies but still are considered toners. Really?? It‚Äôd dry out your skin?? Man I have super dry skin and it always makes it so much better! And it helps with my old acne scars and breakout! But I‚Äôm happy you found your skin care routine that works for you! Great idea! I usually just turn it upside down and scoop off what is stuck to the inside of the lid with my fingers. This sounds much more efficient. Almost out of my liquid gold (sadly), so I'll have to try this. Thanks! Best idea ever! Thanks!  Haha I'm glad it was at least productive then!

YMMV, but I've found that making sure my skin is hydrated properly helps with oil production, especially on my T-zone. I wouldn't say that any of these products specifically target oil production though. Debating the cosrx rice or honey mask myself! Hmm! Ugh yes, someone commented this earlier :( So bummed! I have seen the Farm Stay version online, I wonder how similar it is. I should look into it! Great, thank you! I wish! I‚Äôm in the arctic tundra of Wisconsin. But I‚Äôll remember this if I‚Äôm ever traveling, thank you!  Where do I find Asian beauty stores? I‚Äôm in so cal and really want to try the sunscreen as well.  Ooh, that's a bit not good!

For my own experience, if I forget the sunblock and I'm in the sun for a good while, I can burn. Typically I just tan... but the darker the tan, the longer it lasts. I was in Italy last May for a few weeks, and all of my visible skin got a few shades darker (there went all my foundation) - but especially my feet.

You can still see the tan and we're a few months from a year since I was there. I will probably still have it when May comes around again. üò≠ Thanks! I tried the Australian Gold and so wanted to love it, but my skin wasn‚Äôt happy. It was a total bummer. Yeah, the small size of Asian sunscreen is so unfortunate, but luckily a little goes a long way! Thanks! Might give that one a try next!! Thanks!! I've actually been doing the opposite where I only use one active in the AM (Vit C) and PM (AHA) because I thought I'd be overdoing it with several actives at the same time, but yeah it's personal preference. Also the moisturizer I'm thinking of using for the AM with my Vit C contains Niacinamide and I've heard different things about mixing these 2 ingredients together but I really want to use both products together.. has it caused you any problems?  Yea Asian toners tend to be hydrating so they are often thicker compared to western ones - I looove them (I have dry skin hahaha). I use the Cezanne one! You can use it where you use toner in your routine - although it definitely isn‚Äôt hindered at all where you have it in your routine so I don‚Äôt mean to imply you‚Äôre ‚Äúwrong‚Äù (you‚Äôre not) just adding this here in case anyone else is interested in the toner and where to put it in their routine :D

It goes on colourless for me too so I think it has to be some reaction or something like you said! That‚Äôs all I can think of too! So weird eh?! I guess my question here if I want to add them into my routine which is double cleanser, toner w/ salicylic acid, and the moisturizer. When and where would I add it? I like the Snail Bee, but it is definitely not as hydrating as the Scinic. I know people rave about it's brightening properties thanks to the arbutin. I hope it works out for you! Gotcha, thanks!  SO cute! I love the pot. Ah you're going to love it! It feels so light on the skin, and even though it doesn't leave a white cast, I feel like it has a bit of a brightening effect. Nope, you're right! I do put it on a clean face, I just use it after another active. The AHA and BHA aren't really "toners", they're acids that get rid of dead skin cells.
 Yeah, it can be hard to pinpoint where the problem is. Maybe keep a spreadsheet of the products you try so you can compare the ingredients and find the culprit! It‚Äôs not heavy at all and the eye cream donesnt burn at all. Some of the more expensive eye creams I have burn for so reason. With this one I can literally rub all around and not have issues! Maybe worth a shot and it‚Äôs super cheap through Walmart. Sprouts marks it up about 40% (no joke)here in California... that‚Äôs where I found it originally. Ugh I know, Asian skincare companies are constantly discontinuing and reformulating; it sucks!! Especially since this product has been around forever, so many people are going to be disappointed. For the thicker type of hydration that the Scinic gives, I also like the Cosrx 96 Snail Essence, so I'll probably be switching to that for now. I have tried it! The Premium is a lot thicker and has more types of hyaluronic acid; I find it to be a lot more hydrating. Yeah I get mine at Walmart and they usually have the extra tall jars that have 20 extra pads in it for no extra cost so for 4 bucks youre good to go. Theres always a few things that are gonna be cheaper in store than on Amazon  Well, if you've found something that works for you, stick with it! You could try physically exfoliating with a microfiber cloth. I know this sub hates physical exfoliation, but as long as you're gentle, it's perfectly fine. Oh, nope! I mentioned in my post which products I use in the AM. The Hada Labo, ampoule, moisturizer, and sunscreen! I just don't use the cleanser in the AM. I use BHA 5 days a week and AHA the other 2. I usually leave 2 or 3 days in between each AHA application since it is more harsh. Lactic acid is pretty gentle though, so you could do it more often and see how it goes. I use glycolic acid which is stronger.

Vitamin C in the AM and other actives at night is a good system. Vitamin C actually offers some slight UV protection (though NOT a substitute for sunscreen), so many people recommend using it in the AM. You're not wrong, but the anyone who is not familiar with Asian beauty products would be confused if I referred to it as a toner. Traditionally in Western skincare, toners have a water-like consistency and are considered "clarifying". This product is thick and very moisturizing/hydrating. I stand by my classification of it as a serum for the purpose of this post, as that is what it is most similar to both in consistency and benefits in the Western skincare world. Cheers! Same to you!! I know aloe is a HG product for many people. I also decanted my scinic.. but I actually use a Hada labo bottle. It fits most of the ampoule and it's a lot easier to pour into! Yea a lady I went to see said my skin was dehydrated which is why it creates so much oil, she said vitamin c helps with it so I‚Äôm still trying to scavenge products. I‚Äôll figure it out eventually^ The honey one is nice too! if it makes you feel better, the Amazon price for the 3 pack is cheaper than what I can get locally. I just dont use Amazon enough to justify paying for shipping (no prime). If you‚Äôre near LA or especially Orange County there are tons! In Irvine alone there are like I think easily 3-4 different stores just selling Japanese or Korean beauty products, and that‚Äôs not including those kiosks inside of supermarkets. In LA Koreatown too, esp near Galleria. When I have a little more time, I‚Äôll pull up exact addresses for you. What I like is no worrying about whether it‚Äôs the real deal If you have a face shop in a mall near you you can start there, not 100% sure they carry that specific product though True. When you‚Äôre used to American sunscreen and how much you have to use for it to be effective, the Asian sunscreens look like they‚Äôd last about a week. But the formulation is so different that a tiny bottle will last a surprisingly long time. I was pleasantly surprised.  Oh yeah, I definitely wouldn't use AHA and BHA at the same time (or even the same day), but Vit C isn't as harsh (at least on my skin), so it works for me! I've also heard mixed reports about the vit c/niacinamide combo. There was a few times (and a long time ago, using different products) that my face turned bright red when applying niacinamide after vit c, but I haven't had a problem since then. Maybe I wasn't waiting long enough before applying the niacinamide product?  Anyway, [Paula](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/myths/can-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-be-used-together.html) says it's fine, so I wouldn't worry too much! If you already use a salicylic acid product, then you wouldn't need to use these. They're the same thing (I'm assuming you're using a 2% SA formulation). The snail bee has been reformulated and sadly no longer has arbutin in it. They are using niacinamide now. 
IMO still a great product! That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm looking for! Thanks for sharing!  Ooooooh! I actually did this before when I was trying out Klairs! Thank you for reminding me! Will do this again! Oo thanks, I'll give it a Go üëå [deleted] [deleted] I agree. I don‚Äôt really like buying any beauty products from amazon or eBay. I‚Äôve gotten fake shampoo and makeup from there. Wasn‚Äôt happy about it. I‚Äôm live out in the inland empire but I‚Äôm out in la and oc for work often. I know of a big Asian market in Rancho Cucamonga, but it‚Äôs more of a grocery/fish store. Wonder if they carry skincare.  I‚Äôll google it. Thanks!  Oh nice! It's been years since I tried it, I might have to give it another go! Not Asian but the Derma-E anti-wrinkle vit A/retinyl cream has been an incredible (and honestly better) replacement for the snail bee for me. Way more hydrating and there‚Äôs arbutin in it, my skin is definitely more plump and it‚Äôs working on my scars.   Nope, I don't use actives in the morning! Just at night on my clean face after cleansing. Yikes!!! Poor gal. Yeah, the word toner has so many meanings, I usually don't like to use it. The Korean and Japanese markets often have a beauty section (I think HMart has the best, but you only get free samples with purchase  if you can speak Korean which I don‚Äôt like)

If the market in RC is. 99 Ranch, it won‚Äôt have anything good. I‚Äôm out in the IE sometimes though so I‚Äôll keep an eye out and post if I see anything there. Irvine has a couple of options if you're in that part of OC! Check out Miibox, it's in a small shopping center on Jeffrey and Irvine Center Drive, where the Dunkin Donuts is. Then down the street from that, on Jeffrey and Walnut, is another shopping center and they just opened up a Shibuyala there! They've got the Biore Watery Essence sunscreen, I buy it there. They also have other brands, I've seen Kiku and Hada Labo in stock there as well as others.

I hope this helps! [deleted] Hmm do you know any that would be closer to Fullerton area? I know I‚Äôm going to be out that way tomorrow for work.  I usually just use HL in the morning, but that's just personal preference! You totally could apply it after the actives (I recommend wetting your face first, so it can trap all that hydration on your skin).

I use the Stridex pads once per day, every day, unless I am using the AHA. So like 5-6 times per week. If you're not currently using them, make sure you build up to regular usage! You don't want to over exfoliate and cause a breakout. Start with every other day or so.

I don't rinse my face after the Stridex wait. You could, but there isn't really anything to rinse off. My skin always feel dry and tight due afterward, so I go straight for the ampoule. 

Hope this helped! [deleted] No prob!! I love talking about skincare haha.

I honestly have never used one of those devices, so I can't give you any good advice on that. Theoretically speaking, I would think that it might be a little harsh on your skin to use both at the same time, so I personally wouldn't do it. And I don't think you would see any additional benefits from using them at the same time, so I would go with using the brush in the AM and the Stridex at night. I'm sure that someone else has a better answer for you though! I love that shelf! Where did you find it? :)  I have acne-prone, dehydrated skin. Been working on everything for about 18mos now, and it seems to be working so far. I'm in my early 30's and right now wrinkles aren't an issue, and I'm hoping to keep it that way! 

**Morning Routine:** I've really loved the Av√®ne Cleanance series. I don't have sensitive skin, but this has just been great with reducing my oil production and not over drying. 

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne Cleanance Cleanser

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne Cleanance Mattifying Toner 

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne PhysioLift Jour 

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne Cleanance Mattifying Emulsion 


**Night Routine:** 

‚Ä¢ Nuxe Foaming Micellar Water (Smells like roses and feels heavenly.) 

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne Cleanance Cleanser 

‚Ä¢ Nip & Fab Glycolic Acid Pads

‚Ä¢ Vichy LiftActive (Tiny, pricey, but has been giving me a little more lift and overall brightness to my complexion.)

‚Ä¢ Vichy Mineral 89 (New for me, but it's been my favorite HA I've tried!) 

‚Ä¢ Caudal√≠e Premier Cru Elixer (Haven't been using this long, but I wish I had been doing it the whole time. It's probably my most expensive product, but I don't see myself going without it ever again.) 

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne Physio Lift Eye Cream (I like this, but I might phase it out when it's empty.) 

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne PhysioLift Night

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne Hydrance Light Emulsion (If I'm feeling extra dry from being outside in the cold, or doing a heavy clay mask.) 


**Occasionally:** 

‚Ä¢ Nip & Fab Glycolic Scrub

‚Ä¢ Av√®ne Cleanance Mask & Scrub 

‚Ä¢ TO 30% AHA - 2%BHA chemical peel (Skin always looks amazing after I use this and a sheet mask follow-up.) 


There's obviously more on this shelf. I'm actually starting to shy away from the CosRX chemical exfoliants. And just know that if I'm at home, I'm probably spritzing the Av√®ne thermal water on me most of the day.  Holy shit I love this shelf. The nerdy organizer in me is instantly picturing one section for morning routine, one section for night, and then all the other things I can put in other shelves... Bookmarked!  Love that shelf!!! Can you share your skin type and some mini-reviews of your favorite products? Shelfies can be fun to look at, but they're so much better when we can learn something from your experience. Where is it messy? Love this collection... Nuxe, Avene, Klorane! The best AVENE!! I feel like I never see anything about it on here but I can't get enough of that stuff! 

My favorite lately is the compensating cream!  Love avene products! Tempted to just use that only  Love it, this collection makes my soul happy!! Avene is amazing!!!!!!  I feel like I've been transported to France! So nice to see :) I love your flannel collection! üòç A fellow Avene fan! Which are your favorites?  Haha, a fellow batiste hint of brown user! I love the batiste dry shampoos. Total life savers! Wonderful shelfie, OP! üòÄ Do you find that the Nip + Fab pads are gentle enough to use everyday? And if so, when you use the TO mask, do you not use the N+F pads in the same day?  Omg you have solved like 2 different problems of mine with this picture. 

DUH HANGY THINGS Oooooooooh The Ordinary I want üòç Avene, I happily have üëåüèº What other Avenue products would you recommend? I have their hydrating toner and cleansing milk and like them, although I can‚Äôt say the milk cleans too thoroughly. Curious to try other things if you have a specific one you really like (especially if any are great for dry winter skin :)!)  Have you tried Av√®ne Ysth√©AL intense ?  
(I think it is called retrinal in the US, it is the ombre brown bottle)   
It is a 0.1% retinal which is more potent than retinol. Aw i love the shelf!  Did you order your Cosrx products in Europe? If so, from what store?  I have difficulties finding a webstore that looks trustworthy.  How does the Vichy 89 compare to the aqualia thermal serum? I wasn‚Äôt too keen on that and was wondering if their new offering was better. Also, lovely shelf! The flannels are also v cute! Hehe someone else loving Avene products. I've been really really loving their most gentle cleanser. Its non foaming but it leaves my face clean without that squeaky clean feeling. Actually you use the normal cleanser (the green botthe of I see that correctly). I highly highly recommend changing to the sensitive version, when I swapped I saw huge results (https://www.avene.de/produkte/id/cleanance-hydra-beruhigende-reinigungscreme/). It has helped a ton with redness and irritation and my skin loves it. Avene products are so amazing. But sadly one can barely find them in the US. :( I want the shelf and all the fun stuffs!! Omg I have that exact same shelf:)) What do you think of the nip & fab pads? I‚Äôve bought a tub but not started using yet  Really love your towel storage, I want to have a towel shelf like yours Uh ... How is this little? What do you think of the nip and fab scrub. I'm debating between it and the skinfix micro scrub.  How is the Mineral 98? Is it a moisturizer? How do you feel about that dead sea mask?  I like how you have vichy in there. I am going to try this line I just been researching it lately! Had some extra money and tried to find items in my area but they were sold out at Walgreens. Plus I didn‚Äôt really know what to buy. 

The makeup remover had mixed reviews. One saying the best ever and two saying it burned their eyes and it overhyped. A blog said it was the best and melted eye makeup remover. The website does a lot of scientific research. I may try a few of these products you listed.  That shelf is so niiiiiice. Hi there! I also have acne prone skin and after coming off birth control my skin is going crazy. I wanted to know how helpful Avene products have been for you? I‚Äôve never tried that brand and am willing to give it a try if it has been a game changer for your skin. The Nuxe shimmering dry oil and the cleanser * insert heart eyes emoji *

Love the style of this shelf! So unique and it gives you so much storage space for different sizes of bottles! Not sure what kind of hair you have, personally mine is fine and tends toward oiliness so I use the klorane dry shampoo quite often! I find it best to apply the night before so that it evenly costs the roots.. also I prefer it more than other brands (i.e. batisse) because it doesn‚Äôt make my hair feel crunchy or still dirty. It actually makes it feel quite silky! Anyway I hope it works for you too :) Love it! amazing! Messy? From where? i want this shelf! aghhh I picked up that Avene Cleanance Mat moisturizer while I was backpacking in Europe and I really love it! Too bad its $25 in the US as opposed to like 10 euros in Spain. I'm a guy who only frequents this sub because of some mild unclean skin and I always wonder when I see these posts, do you guys actually use all of this stuff? Doesn't that take really long? As someone who's new to actual skin care you use all of these everyday? I barely wash my face everyday....  I was looking at a few of these products today! My skin is pretty unhealthy but I've been putting off going to Sephora to start collecting for a basic routine because I know that it will cost 200$ at least to start. The products you have on your shelf were in the Canadian drug store I saw! There's hope! I'm not really sure where to start but this is great motivation. My 200$ might go much further than I thought.  Have you tried the Vichy Aqualia Thermal Serum? I was debating between that and Mineral 89 for ages and settled on Aqualia Thermal in the end but interested to try Mineral 89 when it runs out! Klorane is the shit! Found many other brands don‚Äôt work for Asian hair but this one is life changing  What are your thoughts on Avene eye cream? Found it kind f meh and so disheartening when the bottom cap came loose and giveaway the packaging illusion. I think retinol is the star power but I just incorporated retin-a in my routine including eye area. Am also drawn that eye cream are like glorified face cream. Oh no, I've become a little bit obsessed with this shelf now. Not sure how to accommodate the space for this, but now I'm damn determined to try. Daughter 10yrs thinks your shelf cool. ^_^ Where did you get this magical shelf! *heart eyes* I‚Äôm in love üòç does anyone else find it kind of troubling how many products are in all of these shelfies?  Shelfie Would a guy even need half these products? proud for collecting skin care products? Found it on [Amazon] (https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Trends-Keyhole-Hangers-Coated/dp/B01F91946U/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1518104224&sr=8-6&keywords=round+wall+shelf)! Where else?! haha... It also has a few different colors (i think), if teal isn't your jam.  Where'd you get that wonderful shelf?! I love Vichy‚Äôs mineral 89!!!! Why do you like the Caudalie so much? What results have you noticed since you have been using it? How do you like the Nuxe oil?  What is Vichy V 89 targeted for? I'm curious about that one.  Avene does the most amazing, mattifying sun protection cream I have ever used.  First of all I'm jealous! Second, what do you think about The Ordinary vitamin c? I just got mine today and I hear it can really dry out your skin. I mixed a little with a serum to try a transition.  >I actually starting to shy away from the Cosrx chemical exfoliants.

Why do you say that? I just got the Mineral 89 as well! I was surprised to see how quick it was absorbed and dry on my skin compared to Hada Labo Premium (who gave me cystic acne sadly). I hope this one will work for me. Av√®ne! I forgot about that stuff. I had a dermatologist recommend one of their redness relief moisturizers and I loved it. A little pricey but worth it. Is there anything you would recommend getting from them? You obviously are a fan of their line. :) TIA!! Love you!!! That was my initial idea, and it will probably move to that. This pic was just to showcase the collection as a whole.  Was working on it! I have my routine and I'll add a little more about the products.  Towel anxiety! Ha! It‚Äôs not as messy as I think it is. I‚Äôm my own worst critic.  I‚Äôm an American that‚Äôs currently living in Europe, so I didn‚Äôt know of these brands before I moved here. Now, I‚Äôm waiting for the appropriate time to start hoarding everything I love before I move back so I can still get everything at a marginally reduced rate, as opposed to ordering and shipping to the states.

The Klorane I‚Äôve only tried a couple times, but I‚Äôm not so sure about it. We‚Äôll see!  Av√®ne is my favorite! I agree, I never see it on here. But, from what I understand it's not exactly easy to get in the states, so that could be why. I don't know about the compensating cream, so I'd love to hear about it!  I‚Äôm a bit of a recent Francophile with a touch of Brit in me. I‚Äôm finding I like French skin care much more than Korean. But, everyone is different!  Ikea, baby!!! I never really understood why I should be using a new one every day, but when I saw them at 1.99‚Ç¨/10, I figured I'd give it a go. Still trying to work out a way to make them look "cuter." But so far, this is working.  The Cleanance Expert is legitimately the best pimple cream I‚Äôve come across. 

If I get a pimple I will often tab an excessive amount on before bed and let it soak in. The pimple is either completely gone by the morning or nearly invisible. 

Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. 

The flaming facial wash is brilliant too.  I love the cleanser and the mattifying emulsion. A heavier moisturizer during the day is a bit much for me, so this is perfect. And of course, I love the thermal water spray, even if I look like a nerd while using it.  Haha! I love it! I got the Klorane dry shampoo with oat milk because it‚Äôs supposed to be the best in the world. I‚Äôve only used it a couple of times, but I think I like the Batiste more! It‚Äôs also a little cheaper, soooo.... [deleted] I use them every day, even on days I use the TO mask. Now, I have pretty hearty skin, so that might not be for everyone. But, I've never had a terrible interaction by using both on the same day.  Duh hangy things is pretty much my motto!!! For dry skin I use their Hydrance emulsion in light, but you can also buy it in intense if you have extra dry skin. I also use the cold cream for my hands and the lip cold cream is a dream come true. 

I agree with you on the milk cleanser. I never feel as clean as I do with a foaming cleanser. But, a lot of people with sensitive skin sweet by it, so what do I know!  Haven‚Äôt yet. I think that‚Äôs my next step. I like the Physio series, but now I feel comfortable trying the upgraded version after these guys run out.  I ended up buying my CosRX products from Amazon. I used to use a lot more before I started moving to French products. I'm confident they are legit, I just fell out of favor with them.  I've ordered CosRX from Wishtrend (a Korean site) for my daughter. We haven't had any issues there and I believe they may be partnering with Amazon. We're in the States, so the delivery time was considerable. That was the main issue. I lived in Korea up until recently, so I was able to grab a bunch while there, along with Skinfood and Tonymoly. I do see that Ulta sells some CosRX also. Do you have Ulta in Europe? I've never used it, so I can't give you an informed opinion. But I can describe this one as thick but not sticky. Goes on very clean and absorbs quickly. And I don't feel a drying that some HA serums give me. Hope that's helpful, and thank you for the compliment!  I don't actually have sensitive skin, so I think the blue Cleanance cleanser is working quite well. I have recommended the cleansing cream to a friend of mine and she loves it. 

I'm so worried about when I move back to the states and can't get these products so easily. Right before I move back I'm going to stock up so I have at least a couple of years worth!! Where did you get it?? Love them! I tried Stridex for a while and I liked them, but I always felt like I needed to over-moisturize after. I don't feel like that with these. Try them out!  It‚Äôs not... In fact, it‚Äôs quite large. What you can‚Äôt hear in a picture is my husband and our bank accounts crying in the corner.  I actually really love it! Smell is nice and citrusy, you only need a very tiny bit, and don‚Äôt use a lot of pressure when applying. It‚Äôs fairly inexpensive, so I'd say give it a try!  It's great for when you just wanna do a clay mask without the hassle of an aztec clay mask. Not sure how much it helps, but I know it doesn't hurt!  Love them! I was controlling my acne before I found Av√®ne, but these products do it without me feeling like I need to suck the moisture out of a cactus to survive. Everything is light and clean. Not sure where you live, but you might be able to buy the travel-sized versions and test them out before you commit to the full-size.  Ugh, that's the worst! It's my favorite moisturizer. I wonder if it would be cost-effective to order a few bottles from Europe and have them ship it over in one package. It might not be 10‚Ç¨, but it might not be $25.  I use a good portion of it everyday. It really doesn‚Äôt take as long as you would think. But, I also use the time to sort of treat myself. So, instead of just quickly washing my face, I turn it into a little ritual that I look forward to doing.  I use a lot of them everyday. I‚Äôve made it a ritual. Not everyone will use this much and some will use more! Everyone‚Äôs skin and routine is different. There may come a time when I pair down, but for right now this is working for me!  dude you 100% don‚Äôt have to go to sephora or even a drugstore and buy a full line. you can mix/match stuff and pick what works best for your skin. a whole lot is gonna be trial and error, but your $200 is gonna go astronomically further than you thought. my entire skincare routine totals at $50-$75 depending on if i buy stuff not only for the face, but for my hair, body and nails too.  It absolutely will! The basic face wash, toner, and moisturizer will probably cost you less than $50 USD. You don‚Äôt need to start by going to Sephora. Try your drug store! There is a great sidebar on the sub with drug store products that work for a lot of people. Start small and manageable and work your way up, if you need to!  Another user mentioned it, but I've never used it. I think Vichy is really trying to push the Mineral 89, so your local shop may even have little samples of it to try. I know what you mean about the packaging reveal. But I think by the bottom pushing up we're actually getting the most product we can. 

As for the eye cream, I don't see myself repurchasing after it's out. I may go for the .01% retinal cream, but I haven't decided yet.  Well, when you‚Äôre tying to combat a few different issues, you sometimes use different products. I use a lot everyday, but a lot of these are also once-a-week things.  And some of them I‚Äôm phasing our entirely. 

After growing up with terrible acne and being embarrassed to walk out of my house, I‚Äôm now confident enough to not wear makeup when I go out. Some people collect matchbox cars. I put that money into my skin. 

 I‚Äôve always found it a bit confusing. Some theories I have (and people, please tell me which is accurate): 
1-trying out products to find what works and can‚Äôt bring yourself to throw away what doesn‚Äôt-OR saving them to maybe use on less sensitive skin like arms or feet
2-rotating products like you rotate shampoos and conditioners 
3-you actually use all that stuff on a regular basis which I‚Äôm like whoa about
 No.  This may sound crazy, but man skin is not inherently different from lady skin. Men can benefit from skincare products too! There‚Äôs a few guys that have larger collections that this. 

Basic routines only bed 3-5 products. Collections like this are a choice by enthusiasts.  I mean, maybe not. But maybe?  [deleted] Welcome to skin care addicts!
 Thank you! Your setup is cool af. I swear, Amazon has everything.

Thank you so much!  If teal isnt your meal ü§£ I swear, Amazon has everything.

Thank you so much!  awh, and of course, like everything it's 3 times the cost for Canadians :( [Amazon!] (https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Trends-Keyhole-Hangers-Coated/dp/B01F91946U/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1518104224&sr=8-6&keywords=round+wall+shelf) Just started using it and I think I‚Äôm in love!  So, I've literally only been using it for a few days. So far, the immediate results have been my face feels softer than it has in a while. It's glowy without feeling greasy and the smell is lovely. I've also been using it on my neck and d√©collet√© along with the Vichy 89 and I am beginning to notice my sleep lines (I'm a side sleeper) are beginning to fade. 

I think I'm going to spring for the Caudalie Beauty Elixir next!  I like Caudalie as well.

I like their glycolic mask (the sample lasted me about 5-6 uses). It doesn't sting my face as much as the Cosrx AHA liquid. Their moisturizing mask is alright. I also really like their vine active serum. It keeps my face bright and smooth, and I feel like the result actually stays unlike the ones I tried from Shu Uemura and Lancome Visionnaire (both of them had mica in them).

I also love their hand cream. I feel like I don't have to reapply as much as the other ones I've tried.

I wasn't sure what the beauty elixir was supposed to do, but I bought it out of curiosity. I later realized that it has alcohol in it, so I decided to use it as my setting spray. It keep my foundation looking fresh throughout the day. Heaven in a beautiful little French bottle! The one pictured is my ‚Äúfancy‚Äù Nuxe that I use when I‚Äôm going out. I have another, larger bottle without the golden shimmer that I use everyday after my shower. It‚Äôs another item I will never not have on me. (I even have a tiny travel bottle!)  It's a hylauronic acid gel made with thermal water. It's used like any HA, to help retain moisture. I've found that when I use an HA before I moisturize, my skin feels and looks better. I've noticed I have less excess oil production and I attribute that to being better hydrated. I've tried other HA gels, but so far I'm liking this one the most.  Just got a sample of it today! Looking forward to using it! 
 I.... don't like it. I have pretty strong skin and it gives me A LOT of uncomfortable tingles. I like the other TO items I've purchased, but I'm not sure I gel with this one. I didn't feel it dry out so much as it was just incredibly uncomfortable. But, I got it because I know it works for a lot of people. 

I am on the lookout for a Vit C serum, but I'm liking the Vichy ActivLift in the mean time.  Long story short, I wasn‚Äôt loving the way my skin felt when I was using them and I‚Äôve found other products I like that are delivering the same results!  Totally depends on the type of skin you have. I've made other suggestions all around the comments, but I would have to say I love the thermal water spray and the mattifying emulsion!  Interested in this too! Particularly the left half of your shelf. You seem to have a good amount of french products. Any particular reason why? Care to recommend any brands/products that are good alternatives to their western/asian counterparts?

How do you feel about the Vichy products?

How do you choose which products to use on which night? You have multiple ingredients in diff products for example you have nip+fab aha and cosrx aha, how do you choose when you use what?

Also are those face towels at the bottom? Where from? 

Thanks! Haha aren't we all It‚Äôs funny (in a good way ofc!) how Americans are excited about European products and vice versa, Europeans are excited about American products! I‚Äôm European and during my first time in the US the first thing I‚Äôve put in my shopping cart besides food/drinks was Stridex in the red box. I was so happy when approaching skincare aisle (and Walmart generally omg ü§©). Is it hard to get in the US?  In Canada its in major drugstores along with LRP,  Vichy and Bioderma. Im surprised to hear this!  I get painfully dry winter skin and literally would try anything. Some how happened on the compensating cream and it worked wonders. They call it extremely rich but it's not goopy or wet feeling. My makeup goes on wonderfully over it. 

I don't think I will use it in the summer time as my skin transitions to being a little more oily. But will definitely repurchase when the weather cools again!

I wouldn't say it has done anything for my occasionally zit but the fact that it cured my terrible dry skin this winter has me won over. 

Amazon has a good collection at a reasonable price but when a family member goes to France I always have them pick me up the more pricey items. 

I saw something about mattifying sunscreen up above and Im going to try that next!!  I like the way you have them arranged! It looks like a luxurious bathroom or hotel. Treat yo‚Äô self like the VIP you are üòé FLAMING what even is this I can't find it anywhere but it sounds so cool!  YES! I never understood the fuss about the Klorane dry shampoo, I didn't like it. But I loooove the tinted Batiste dry shampoo.  I love me some batiste! I havent tried the tinted ones though, how is the brown? Thanks so much for the reply! Im currently patch testing the pads and just placed an order for the TO mask last week, so this is more than helpful! What kind of sheet mask do you use afterwards?  No really tho. 

I'm getting acoustic foam pads to hang on my bedroom and living room walls because when I get drunk I old white lady rap to current hiphop. At 3am. My neighbors are 25ish. But that shit is so ugly. But if I put it in DUH HANGY THINGS I can make it "architectural" and shit. 

You did this. 

Thank you.

(And of course vertically double hang awesome shelves like this in the bathroom and I can remove that hell hole little shelf shelf that blocks my outlet.) There are no Ulta's where I live. I've also looked on Amazon (the German version), but they don't sell cosrx. I found a site called little wonderland, but I can't find many reviews on how trustworthy they are. But I'll definitely look at Wishtrend and see if they'll ship to me. Thanks! Good idea. I did the other way round and moved to the states so now I always take back a stash when I visit. But they also sell stuff here online so it's not impossible. I got it from Burke‚Äôs outlet as a Christmas gift from my mom  Thanks!  I don‚Äôt have much of a routine at the minute but my forehead is so oily! It never used to be that way  Ha! XD So right!! I'm lucky that I spend less on these products because of my location. Start with the relatively inexpensive items and work from there. I found a great ointment that I use on my dry hands for only 3‚Ç¨! There's absolutely no reason why you need to jump into a single brand, or the "higher" end products.  There's so much hope! I definitely need to go out and start this.  I think all three are true. Some products are rotated during different seasons. Some people find that a scrub they didn't like for their face, they like on their feet. 

I'm looking at this as an investment in the future healthiness of my skin. I heard someone say on a podcast that skincare is a long game. I wanna look 45 when I'm 65. Eventually, I might cut some products. But (mostly) every night before bed, I have a ritual that gives me a little time to myself and makes me happy. i wasn‚Äôt trying to be mean i‚Äôm just sayin i don‚Äôt wanna foster an environment where people feel like they need to buy EVERYTHING if you have the financial means go for it but it just feels like maybe we shouldn‚Äôt fully celebrate an excess of stuff  YES! I have a lot of family in Canada and spent a great portion of my life there. (In fact for dinner tonight, I made myself what I call "faux" Swiss Chalet, which is roast chicken, homemade fries, and packaged Chalet sauce! Heaven! haha) 

All this to say, I understand what you mean. Ha! This might be a stupid question, but how did you get that shelf to hang on a tiled wall? The walls in my bathroom are also tiled and I haven‚Äôt figured out how to hang a shelf that has a strong enough hold for all my products.  Thank you very much!  I've heard other people use it as a setting spray, as well. I'll have to try it out and see. For now, I'm hoping to see if I can score a sample or a travel size to see if I like it. I kind of went all in on the Premier Cru Elixer. Turns out, I love it. But it could have been a slightly costly mistake.  Oooh that sounds wonderful! I presume you use it mainly for body rather than face?  Its amazing. Ive just run out and need to replace. Cant imagine using another spf.  My absolute favorite Vit C serum has been the Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid. I've got really sensitive eyelids prone to seborrheic dermatitis and am prone to dark circles even with loads of sleep. I can use the Triple c Lightning Liquid around my outer eyelids with no problems and with consistent use it works fairly well to lighten the dark circles. It does tingle on my skin still, but obviously I use less around my eyelid area so it doesn't tingle around there. I don't feel like it's as drying as others either and made a huuuge difference in texture for me.   Hmm interesting. I felt a tiny tingle when I put it on, but like I said it was in a serum. I've heard really great reviews so hopefully I get some results. It was pretty cheap on Sephora. I'll have to check out Vichy, I've never heard of that brand.  I live close to France and fell in love with their whole philosophy on skin care. On top of that, their products smell and feel amazing. As far as alternatives, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm informed enough to give those. What I can say is, after trying a ton of miceller waters, I think they are all pretty much the same. (Except my Nuxe foaming miceller water, which is bomb.) 

I tried Av√®ne when I got interested in thermal water spray. From there I tried samples from their acne line and loved the results. I said I would only stick with Av√®ne, but the other brands kept creeping in, and I love it! 

As for the towels, they are from Ikea and the cheapest thing on my shelf! Something like 2-3‚Ç¨ for 10! I got two packs!  Saw you had way more questions than I answered so here's your pt. 2! 

Vichy - I'm new to the brand but so far, I'm into it. I'm loving this Mineral 89, and the lift I think will be a keeper. I do think I'm going to move it to my morning routine, though. 

I pretty much use the Nip+Fab exclusively now. I liked the CosRX products and purchased them because they were so raved about on this sub. I think they work great for people, but for me, I always felt like I wasn't getting anywhere with them. Maybe I didn't know how to moisturize properly at that time, but I ended up finding something I liked better. 

I hope that's somewhat helpful!!  The grass is always greener! haha Hmmm. I've been using Philosophy's Back to Nurture cream (which I think was rebranded as When Hope is Not Enough balm). The ingredients in the Avene Extremely Rich compensating cream are very similar, but the Avene is cheaper! Good to know! Damn, I mean FOAMING. 

Flaming sounds so badass I like it... looks less powdery, but I do have to wash my hands after I fluff my hair out, or I leave little brown prints everywhere.  I'll be honest, I buy a ton of various sheet masks at TK Maxx, so I'm not set on any particular brand. When I use a sheet mask after the TO mask I try to use something that hydrates, like an HA mask. But, they all hydrate to an extent, so I'm not too selective.  Then you're basically a fellow canuck! ~ haha I love Swiss chalet. I was actually just there Tuesday with my grandma! I should try making it at home, but I think my Grandma would get annoyed if we didnt have our once a month lunch date there! 

And you write like I do (insert entire ramble, finish with the point) haha Where did you get packed chalet sauce ? Are you in us? I  Not stupid at all!! I found these adhesive hooks on amazon that hold around 16lbs each. The two of them together and a safety on one the top keeps the whole shelf pretty sturdy! 

Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs been a process to keep this shelf up,  but it seems to be okay now. Plus, the actual shelf is lighter than it looks.  Yeah, I don‚Äôt really use it on my face. Just body and sometimes hair.  I‚Äôve heard that some women use it on their face, but I have other things. 

I don‚Äôt know where you live, but where I am it‚Äôs about 25‚Ç¨ for the largest bottle. That‚Äôs lasted about 3 months so far, and I still have at least one month left. So, it‚Äôs not the least expensive, but it lasts.  What is the name of the mattifying sunscreen? I can‚Äôt find one that specifically says mattifying. Thanks!!  [deleted] This maybe a stupid question, but what is the french philosophy on skincare? I think you get more product with philosophy! When I first got it I didn't realise it was actually tinted (I've tried the CoLab dry shampoos which don't have the white powdery effect and thought these were similar). I had left grubby little handprints halfway across my house before I realised :( Thats what I was wondering! Thanks a lot! YES! We are now best friends, dump everyone else and come over for a sheet mask party!  HA! I love that this is a question on r/skincareaddiction. It was actually my aunt in Canada that sent them to me. She does it every Christmas so that I'm always in stock! Thank you!  I realize now that it doesnt actually say mattifying, but it is very matte. Here is a link to the one I use: https://www.notino.dk/avene/sun-anti-age-anti-wrinkle-facial-sunscreen-spf-50/?item=615355&gclid=CjwKCAiAqvXTBRBuEiwAE54dcMn5yzuvDblGkZ5L9HhoC5EA-LCh_FM0GNa98jQYSyfaKBJ1ZE6oyxoCvScQAvD_BwE I thought it was supposed to be left on? But you use it like a mask? I haven't really felt anything different after putting it on, even with a full face of makeup. I'm definitely going to go easy.  True, but price per ounce at full retail is better with Avene! I'll bring the cucumber slices!! Lol I‚Äôm surprised the mod didn‚Äôt take it down I swear half my stuff gets deleted. I‚Äôm gonna try and make that this coming week!

I really enjoyed your post. Lotsa different non-mainstream products.  Is fourth ray something to do with colourpop? Are they any good? Where did you get that Gudetama bottle?! It‚Äôs so cute! I love that Etude House sunscreen. It's a must for oily skin in the summer! It's light, doesn't leave a cast, and mattifies. It also acts as a primer under make-up and wears well. Edit: I updated my reviews on the Fourth Ray products!

&#x200B;

This is my first time posting on here so I apologize if there are errors. This is sort of a shelfie and haul in one because I am testing out the Fourth Ray products so I hope that's okay! I‚Äôm a 23-year-old female with dry to extremely dry skin along with a bunch of redness and occasional pimples. My goal is to have plump, dewy-looking, and hydrated skin! My collection is placed on the shelves based on what each product does and (sort of) in order of how I apply them to my face. Some products I‚Äôm testing, some are replacements, etc. The Fourth Ray Beauty products are new, so I haven‚Äôt been able to test them out much. I'm definitely not a skincare guru but the routine I have listed down below works for me! I marked my HG products with "\*\*\*".

Side note: I‚Äôm in the market for a hydrating mask to replace the Glossier Moon Mask, so if anyone has any recommendations that would be lovely! :)

Top (left to right):

\- Heimish All Clean Balm: I hate the way this makes my eyes weird and cloudy. It takes my eyes forever to go back to normal after this gets into them (and it always does) so I won't be repurchasing but I love the way this breaks down my makeup and it doesn't dry out my skin. If you can handle your eyes going a little wonky while using this, then I would recommend it but it personally really bothers me.

\- Holika Holika Lazy and Easy Gudetama All Kill Cleanser: I started testing this out in hopes to replace the Heimish All Clean Balm (I'm not gonna lie though, I did only buy it because it had Gudetama on it lol). It takes off my makeup just fine, although I feel like I have to rub a little harder compared to the Heimish Balm. It dries out my skin a tad but it doesn't bother me much. 

\- Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser: This is "meh" to me. I like that it's super gentle and it doesn't dry out my skin but it's not groundbreaking; especially for its price. I won't be repurchasing this but will use it up!

\- Fourth Ray Beauty Cloud Bank Milky Cleanser: I plan on replacing the Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser for this as it's cheaper. It's gentle and it doesn't dry out my skin and I really like it.

\- Fourth Ray Beauty Clean Slate Foaming Exfoliator: This stuff smells like essential oils and it's incredibly strong so if your skin has any issues with fragrance I would stay far, far away from it. That being said, my skin doesn't have issues with fragrance and I really love how it makes my skin feel. It's a gritty powder that turns into a foam when water is added and surprisingly, it doesn't take any moisture out of my skin and leaves it feeling really soft! My skin turns bright red even if I only slightly touch it and this stuff hardly irritates it. I will definitely repurchase!

\- Pixie Overnight Glow Serum: This doesn't seem to do anything for my skin but I am using it up so I don't waste it. Definitely won't be repurchasing.

\- Pixie Glow Tonic: My skin prefers this toner over the TO Glycolic Acid because it's less harsh so I use this in between days I use the TO Glycolic Acid and the Fourth Ray Clean Slate. It keeps my skin even and balanced and it doesn't irritate it.

\- The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution: My skin is a little sensitive to this one so I only use it when my skin really needs it. Once I run out, however,  I'm going to replace it with the Fourth Ray Clean Slate exfoliator and use the Pixi Glow Tonic on the days I'm not physically exfoliating. That being said, I think this stuff works really well. It takes off dead skin like a charm and leaves my face feeling refreshed and balanced. Personally, my skin just benefits from physical exfoliation more than this product.

\- Glossier Moisturizing Moon Mask: I don't use this often because I don't like it but will use it every once in awhile when my skin needs extra hydration although I'm not completely sure it does ANYTHING for me. I'll use it up because I can't stand to waste it. Again, if you have any recommendations for a moisturizing mask, I'd love to try some out!

&#x200B;

Bottom (left to right):

\- Fourth Ray Beauty Rainfall 2% Hyaluronic Acid Serum: This stuff makes my skin feel plump and soft but as with all FR products, there is an unnecessary amount of fragrance so I would avoid this particular HA if you have issues with fragrance. This gives me an extra boost in hydration that my skin just sucks up! It's not a HG but it does the job and I'll use it up.

\- Fourth Ray Beauty Watermelon Face Milk: Again, this is scented. Watermelon to be exact. I mix this in with the FR HA and the TO Niacinamide but I don't think it does anything extra for me. I'll use it up. I don't recommend it personally. I think a lot of products I own do the same things this product does. I will of course use it up.

\- The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%: This is one of my favorites! I really noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. Will repurchase over and over and over again. I can't live without it.

\- \*\*\*Sunday Riley Luna Retinol Sleeping Night Oil: I always notice the difference in my skin when I wake up in the morning after using this. It leaves it plump and soft and my skin became visibly less irritated (red) over time. I'm hesitant to make this a HG because of the price but I really really love this stuff and could not live without it.

\- The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%: I don't really use this anymore because I didn't notice a difference in my skin texture. That being said, it keeps my face really matte and makeup sits on top of it really well but I don't like my skin to be matte (because it's really dry) and it's personally just an unnecessary step in my routine. If you suffer from oily skin then this would work really well for oil-control I think!

\- \*\*\*Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner: LOVE this stuff. It's moisturizing and it makes all my other products apply so nicely to my skin. It's a HG and I will repurchase forever!

\- The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA: I always use this before my gel moisturizers and I've definitely noticed a difference in the hydration of my skin. Whenever I use this stuff along with my other moisturizers, I've noticed that my skin stays nice and hydrated all day long! Will definitely repurchase!

\- Mario Badescu Drying Lotion: I use this on the occasional pimple. It does the job!

\- Fourth Ray Beauty Good Mood Gel Moisturizer: I bought this in hopes of replacing the Neutrogena Hydro Boost (see below) but so far it doesn't keep my hydrated enough. About 3 hours after having applied this, I already feel like my skin is thirsty. Once again, this has an incredibly strong watermelon scent (are you tired of hearing me say that yet?) and I do not recommend picking this up if your skin hates fragrance. 

\- Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel: This particular scent burns my skin a bit so I won't be repurchasing but I really like the way it makes my skin feel hydrated and cooled/soothed. I purchased it in hopes of finding a cheaper alternative to the \*\*\*Hada Labo Skin Plumping Gel Cream (because it's $27 at my local drugstore and money was tight) but ultimately nothing compares to it. I'll use it up and pick the Hada Labo cream next time lol

\- Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+ / PA+++: This is the first sunscreen I have used on my face so I can't be sure if it's really good or not but my skin doesn't get weird or anything with it so I'll repurchase!

Not pictured:

Nivea Creme (the one in the tin jar, imported from Germany): This creme has been in my life since I was a baby. My mother always used it on me so the smell is nostalgic and it makes my skin feel so nice and hydrated. I use it more often during the winter!

&#x200B;

My morning routine:

\- Rinse my face with water

\- Pixie Glow Tonic (or The Ordinary Glycolic Toning Solution depending on how my skin is looking)

\- Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner

Mix together these three serums:

\- 1. Fourth Ray Beauty Rainfall 2% Hyaluronic Acid Serum

\- 2. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

\- 3. Fourth Ray Beauty Watermelon Face Milk

\- The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA

\- Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel

\- Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+ / PA+++

&#x200B;

My evening routine:

\- Heimish All Clean Balm (when I have makeup to remove)

\- Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser

\- Fourth Ray Beauty Clean Slate Foaming Exfoliator (a couple times a week)

\- Pixie Glow Tonic (or The Ordinary Glycolic Toning Solution) on days I'm not physically exfoliating with the FR Clean Slate Exfoliator

\- Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner

\- Sunday Riley Luna Retinol Sleeping Night Oil

\- Fourth Ray Beauty Rainfall 2% Hyaluronic Acid Serum

\- The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

\- Nivea Creme (winter) & Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel or Fourth Ray Beauty Good Mood Gel Moisturizer (summer)

&#x200B;

I hope I covered everything! Please let me know if I haven't :) Sunprise is one of my favorite sunscreens üòä üòç I love those shelves! Where can I buy them? I love that Glossier Moisturizing Moon Mask. It's so comforting and relaxing on your face. Please do a routine layout and review of each product üòä It‚Äôs required for posts like these! Don‚Äôt want yours to be removed I love looking at people's shelves too, thank you for sharing. It's so interesting to see how deeply personal collections are :) All.gudetama.everything :) That gudetama üòç Love sunprise Gudetama üòªüòªüòª Glycolic Acid buddies üòÄ Gudetama All Kill!!! Love that cleanser for when Im in a rush.... Surprisingly useful against heavy makeup too > Mario Badescu Drying Lotion: I use this on the occasional pimple. I think it does the job

Does anyone know how this compares to the Kate Sommerville version? Lovely shelfie, and the gudetama is sooo cute <3 I saw you mentioned that the niacinamide worked very well for you ‚Äì I'm curious, how long did it take for you to see the effects of it? I started using it a week ago, and so far I can't tell if it makes a difference (aside from a few new pimples, but those could be because of my cycle, so I'll keep at it for now and hope for the best) The Ordinary azelaic acid suspension is my can‚Äôt-live-without product!  I have greasy skin, and it makes my skin not matte, exactly, but gives it a smooth almost velvet-y/blurred finish. I used Makeup Forever‚Äôs smoothing primer for a while but it made my skin bumpy (not zits, just bumps). TO‚Äôs azelaic acid has the same smoothing effect for me and controls the oil without messing with my skin. 

I don‚Äôt know why I just shared all that, but my point is I love love love that stuff and I get excited when I see it in shelfies üòÇüò≥ I love sunprise! Best sunscreen for oily skin I bought that same Gudetama  cleanser for the bottle tbh. I don't care for it though. I'll use it up but it dries me out and I think the fragrance might be slightly irritating my skin. I'll probably keep the bottle for handsoap lol. Great selfie--the Gudetama cleanser is the shizzzz! I also love the gentleness of the Gudetama smooth egg peeling gel. I love the ordinary and pixie products. I was going to buy the Neutrogena gel moisturizer this weekend! What are your thoughts on the Fourth Ray moisturizer compared to the neutrogena? As someone who is getting into skin care, would someone use all of these? Or would it be like a use when necessary thing? Thank you so much, this is super helpful! Taking notes because our skin types sound similar and I‚Äôve had similar experiences! Beautiful shelfie :) I love that Sunday Riley Luna Serum I have the same shelves ü§ó totally agree with your opinion on the Azelaic Acid and Niacinamide too! How often do you use Azelaic acid and when do you apply it in your routine ? i just got the TO glycolic acid and have used it three times this week- sunday, monday, and wednesday. i am finding small bumps on my cheeks and forehead, nothing is irritated or dry, they‚Äôre just hurting my skin‚Äôs texture. do you know if this is purging? i know breaking out is when you get pimples in rare areas, it‚Äôs just rare for me to get these really small bumps around my face. did you experience this? i put adapalene 0.1 on them and they seem to be getting better, i‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs going to get worse if i apply any more (i plan to use it S,M,W,F). thanks! have any of your products helped with unclogging pores? Does the klair‚Äôs scented toner work well for you? I have it but I tried it a few times and thought I was breaking out because of it so ever since I haven‚Äôt touched it üò≠üò© Pretty! GUDETAMA! I use the same sunscreen! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Love this shelf! What do you think is the best face serum for sensitive skin? With anti aging properties if possible. What's the gudetama? Ugg... I just looked at that and it reminded me of an item I have, never once used, and don‚Äôt know where it is... now I‚Äôm doubting if I even ever bought it or just looked at it.  Drowning in skincare, send help. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What toner do you like better? I‚Äôve been using the glow tonic for roughly a year now & it‚Äôs not been the greatest. Recently started contemplating getting the ordinary‚Äôs toner What do you like more the Pixi glow tonic or the ordinary gycolic acid? lmk if you like the clean slate exfoliator! i've been trying to find a similar chemical exfoliator to the powder amore pacific one because it's way too expensive for my budget Holy crap I need shelves just like that. My current dinky bathroom shelf is absolutely overflowing. dude how good is the ordinary moisturiser but how fast does it run out!!! I love it but wish they gave more product for the price üò≠ For moisturizing masks, I recommend either the avocado melt by glow recipe or the REN evercalm ultracomforting rescue mask. 

The glow recipe one has AHAs in it so it exfoliates and moisturizes. I just now saw all the bad reviews on Sephora which honestly shocks me. I have super sensitive and dry skin and it‚Äôs worked wonderfully for me, so I guess it just depends. The REN one is great if you just want to slather on the moisture and let it sink in overnight. Where did you get the all clean balm? Does it work well for you? Can i please ask for a feedback on your TO products, i was considering to buy those in your shelf but i cant really choose which one, i have active acne and oily skin btw. Did you install those shelves yourself? Where'd you get them? Shelfies give me serotonin Yeah it's by the people behind Colourpop. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the products out long enough to give you a definitive answer but I will say they are STRONGLY scented. Personally, I don't mind them but I know a lot of people are sensitive to that stuff. :( I‚Äôve tried a lot of it and they‚Äôre really hit or miss!! I like their cleansing oil a lot (it‚Äôs similar to tatcha‚Äôs but much cheaper), their hyaluronic acid serum is really nice and I like mixing it in w my TO serums and vitamin C powder, I‚Äôm still using the gel moisturizer (it‚Äôs not my fav but it‚Äôs good enough for me during the day), the milky cleanser didn‚Äôt remove my makeup very well so I didn‚Äôt keep using it, and I liked the clean slate scrub but I‚Äôve stopped using physical exfoliants since I joined this sub so that was discarded as well. It's an oil cleanser! I found it at Marshalls! :) I also got a set at Marshall‚Äôs and their facial peel. I asked them to hold it for me and call if it came in, otherwise I would never have gotten it! It's Holika Holika - I don't have the oil cleanser but I got the gudetama 'all-in-one serum' from TJ Maxx. It's nice, it's got some alcohol in it so it 'dries' quickly. Bc of the alcohol I only really use it when I'm planning on applying extra moisturizing things It was the first one I've tried so I'm glad that I made the right choice because I had absolutely no frame of reference haha thanks for the information! :) What sort of effect has the niacinamide had for you? I‚Äôm still not 100% clear on what it does but from other posts it sounds like I may need it! 

I was also gonna ask about the azelaic acid as well but I guess it‚Äôs not worth it? Lovely write up and routine. Skincare is so fun. Do you have an Instagram? Am I allowed to ask on here? I'm new to reddit and have in no way figured it out. Lol I have similar issues with dryness. I too bought the Holika Holika because of Gudetama, I mean, who wouldn't? I'd suggest caution though. I really do love the way that this takes off my 16 hour eyeliner and waterproof mascara. I don't use foundation, so I don't really need it for the rest of my skin. I do find it a tad drying. What I have been doing is using it just on my eye makeup and then giving my face a wash with the cloth I use to rinse with to take off sunscreen and dirt. I find it less drying this way. :) Thanks for the product reviews! It's always nice to read reviews from people who have similar goals! Girl where did you get them shelves from tho I agree about the Glossier Moon Mask! Very underwhelming!! For dryness I recommend:
* Hada Labo Premium Lotion: has HA + urea, I use it on top of Klairs as a second hydrating toner and my skin drinks it up!

* ceramides: a natural oil component of your skin and I find it helps maintain the natural moisture barrier; I used Holika Holika‚Äôs Good Cera emulsion when it was cold and dry out but in warmer weather now I use Mamonde‚Äôs Hibiscus Ceramide Emulsion. Both those brands also make heavier creams if you‚Äôre really struggling with dryness but too heavy of a cream makes me oily so light emulsions are just right for me. 

* sheet masks! I know you‚Äôre looking for another moisturizing mask but look into sheet masks. My skin is always glowy and plump after I put one on at night for around half an hour. There are a lot of ‚Äúhydrating‚Äù options out there, some I can think of off the top of my head I‚Äôve used are TonyMoly It‚Äôs Real sheet mask in Aloe or Tosowoong Pure Deep Sea Water Mask. I saw you mention that the Neutrogena scent burns your skin. They make an unscented one. It‚Äôs the Neutrogena ‚Äòultra dry‚Äô one.

Edit: saw someone mention this below! Sorry for the repeat. Haha. Best moisturiser mask type (not really a mask tbh) is the hada labo skin plumping gel cream (has urea and hyaluronic acid) layered over damp skin and then sealed in with a thin to thick layer of vaseline depending on season/skin dryness.

I also use avene or la roche posay water sprays just to be consistent with minerals etc because I'm paranoid about water quality in my area lol
 
It's my holy grail moisturiser 10/10. I LOVE GUTETAMA üíì My favorite mask for hydration is the Ahava hydration cream mask. It‚Äôs a little expensive, I think it retails at Ulta for around $33 but I got it on sale and I looove it. It‚Äôs gentle and you can either use it as a regular 10-15 minute mask or overnight. Love seeing your opinions on Fourth Ray because as a big Colourpop fan I've been wondering if their FR stuff is any good! As for hydrating masks, I'm a big fan of the Lush Oatifix mask, the only downside is it's perishable and has to be kept refrigerated I love my TO niacinamide but I‚Äôm having the WORST time with it pilling and falling off my face! Have you experienced this or do you have any suggestions? I love the product still, just wish it wouldn‚Äôt pill so much when I apply product over it IMO the Summer Fridays Jetlag Mask is a very hydrating mask and maybe a good replacement for the Glossier Moon mask :) The Neutrogena water gel moisturizer has perfume however their extra dry solution doesn't have any in it and you might like that better! It's what I use and I love it. A lot of people have told me this now and I'm really happy I picked out a good one on my first try! :) I loooove this sunscreen so much I even put it on before I go to work at night. It works like a primer for me! What are the available sizes of sunprise sunscreen? I found them on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y6MGNQZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)!! :) It smells so good and it feels nice but it doesn't give me moisture or any other benefits. I'm so sad it didn't work for me! :( I‚Äôm typing it all up right now. It‚Äôll be up in a second! Thanks for the heads up :) No problem! I totally agree. It really is interesting :) I have never tried any others so I'm glad I picked this one out on my first try! Will definitely repurchase! :) It really is!! It takes my eye makeup off like a dream! They are all the same honestly I‚Äôve tried them both and I feel like they do the exact same thing I can't exactly say, maybe a month or so?? I'm not sure, sorry :( Definitely keep at it though!!! I really hope it works for you <3 I totally had no luck with the azelaic acid BUT I never used it in a way that you do!! Have your found it has any other effects on your aside from it being a good primer? I only ever used it at night so I can't say how it would look with makeup on top of it but just from my experience using it, I can totally see what you mean! It really does give a blurred finish; almost like a silicone primer but better. I might have to try it out under makeup!! Ahh you're so lucky, for some reason it gave me the worst cystic acne ever :( Everyone here loves it too so I was pretty sad! It did feel like it would make a great primer though! Everyone has been telling me they love it! I'm so glad I picked out a good sunscreen on my first try haha It takes my makeup off like a champ but I agree with you! I definitely won't repurchase it when I'm finished with it. I've heard good stuff about the Fourth Ray Beauty BFD cleansing oil so that'll be the next thing I grab :) I wasn‚Äôt able to find that at my Marshalls unfortunately :( What is it supposed to do?? If you have a Costco membership, my Costco had a pack of 2 Neutrogena gels for $22!

Edit: actually it might have been $27 I haven‚Äôt used the FR one much but so far I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference between the two hydration-wise. Both are strongly scented but the scent in the Neutrogena one really bothers my skin and I just really hate the way it smells. The FR one smells like watermelon but I personally like it and it doesn‚Äôt irritate me. They‚Äôre having a sale on it right now. I believe it‚Äôs $10 so maybe give it a try if you can get passed the watermelon scent :) I definitely would not start out using this many products especially if your skin is the type to breakout! I built this routine over the course of a year and while it may seem like an excessive amount of products to use, they all do something for my skin that I can't get from one product alone! :) Some people prefer and can handle more products than others! It's all about what skin concerns you have, how much time you have, and how much you like doing skin care :) I personally like it a lot so I'm collecting more products, but many people have a 'less is more' approach and just use the bare minimum. You are so welcome I'm glad I could help!! :) Thank you so much! It's my pride and joy haha :) I like it but I can't exactly figure out if it's necessary in my routine! Can you tell me what it does for your skin? I'm very curious :) Awesome I'm so glad I'm not the only one! :) If I used it, I would apply it after serums and before my water-based moisturizers at night. As far as I can tell, it hasn't done anything for me though so I unfortunately don't really use it anymore! I get better results from the niacinamide :) I haven't ever purged or broken out with any of the products I use, so I can't help you with that! I'm so sorry :(
Hopefully somebody else in here can answer your questions for you though! If you're not really using any other chemical exfoliants, then it's possible it could be purging? My skin definitely purged from glycolic acid but after a couple of weeks it went away. Hopefully that's the case for you too Unfortunately, no. My pores haven't really bothered me ever as they're very minute (I just have a few blackhead on and around my nose) but if someone has any recommendations, that would be awesome!! Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay!!! I really love it. I put it on directly after cleansing and/or exfoliating and it calms my skin down so so nicely. It feels lovely and all my other products apply like a dream on top of it. With that being said, while my skin may be sensitive as far as redness goes, it can handle a lot of wear and tear and scents. The particular scent in this is much milder compared to all of my other products so it doesn't bother me at all. I wouldn't be surprised if the scent is causing your skin to react though! :( Go for a toner without fragrance :) Thank you! I‚Äôm very proud of it haha :) Thank you!! I 100% recommend the Sunday Riley Luna Oil! It's very calming because it has chamomile and blue tansy in it and it's created specifically to boost plumpness and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles! It's luxurious and definitely a splurge but it makes my skin look amazing when I wake up. It's very slowly becoming a holy grail product to me, I'm just struggling to give it all my love because it's so expensive lol It's the Holika Holika Lazy and Easy Gudetama All Kill Cleanser Oil :) I feel ya! I‚Äôm in a constant battle between trying out new stuff, hating the new stuff and then repurchasing old favorites haha The TO toner is too intense for my skin so I don‚Äôt use it very often but it‚Äôs much better than the Glow Tonic! I wish I could use it every single day but it‚Äôs simply too irritating to my skin so the Glow Tonic is more of my daily toner! I like the TO one better BUT it‚Äôs too intense for my skin so I only use it a couple times a week and use the Glow Tonic all of the other days. I don‚Äôt think the Glow Tonic does enough for my skin but the TO toner is too much for my skin so I kind of feel like I need both of them in my life lol Once I‚Äôve used it for a couple week, I‚Äôll do my best to try and update you! :) The Ordinary's Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA has lasted me a year now I believe! I love it so much. I can't imagine my routine without it :) Yeah it's weird because all the jarred products last me forever, while all the tube products run out fast. Both of those sound really intriguing to me!! I'm definitely going to try them out. I've never tried anything from Glow Recipe so I'm especially excited to try that!! 

I just read about the REN mask and WOW it sounds like it's perfect for my skin! Thank you for these recommendations!! I purchased it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Heimish-Clean-Balm-Cleansing-120ml/dp/B01CJ639SM/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2AR7E9DYR8OF7&keywords=heimish+cleansing+balm&qid=1558706970&s=gateway&sprefix=heimish%2Caps%2C164&sr=8-3)! It gets my makeup off like a dream but it gets so deeply into my eyes and leaves a really terrible cloudy film over them for awhile so I won't repurchase it unfortunately :( The TO products I use are specifically to improve the texture and appearance of my skin and my skin type is the complete opposite of yours so I don‚Äôt really have the knowledge to speak on the behalf of your skin BUT I would recommend both the azelaic acid and niacinamide for oil control. They are fantastic for that. The niacinamide is also good for congested and bumpy skin. If your skin isn‚Äôt super sensitive (and it definitely can‚Äôt be compromised!) the toner is good for getting rid of dead skin cells and improving skin texture and possibly helping with acne. I would do more research on those 3 before making any final decisions though. Like I said, my skin isn‚Äôt like yours so I can‚Äôt give any great recommendations! I‚Äôm sorry and good luck! <3 Not OP, but I have similar skin to you, and I love the glycolic acid toner in the photo above! (Not pictured faves of mine: rosehip seed oil, lactic acid, squalene, and retinol in squalene). They're from Amazon; I searched "acrylic shelves". My boyfriend installed them! It's good to know. I'm pretty sensitive to lots of things so I'll have to be cautious in checking out their stuff. Thank you for sharing! I'm gonna try out the cleansing oil when I need to replace my current one! I have heard a lot of people like it!

And I definitely purged the physical exfoliants after joining this sub too but after doing some research on it recently (after the whole Kyle Jenner walnut scrub ordeal), I added it back into my routine. I guess it's not as bad as everyone made it out to be! :) My skin can definitely handle it and *needs* physical exfoliation every once in awhile otherwise I have this AWFUL dead skin build up that no toner can fix. It isn't for everyone though so I totally understand :)

Thank you for your input on the Fourth Ray stuff!!! Physical exfoliating gets a bad rep here but there isn‚Äôt any evidence that they cause micro tears and the St Ives lawsuit was thrown out. Now YMMV, you have to know if your skin can handle it or not. Using a physical exfoliate once a week isn‚Äôt terrible if you don‚Äôt get a reaction.     
Thank you for the heads up on the products! Really helpful. I was curious as to what was in it! I‚Äôll go check my local Marshalls, thanks! Same here. Such an adorable egg bottle The facial peel broke me out terribly, like tiny dots all over my face I was so upset because I love gudetama and have heard nothing but good things about this product. Did anyone else have a similar experience ? My skin loves TO Niacinamide. I absolutely swear by it. It keeps my skin from feeling congested, and keeps my texture smooth would also like to hear about niacinamide! do you use it when you have active breakouts, or when you are trying to clear up redness/acne? It dramatically improved my skin's texture! It's so smooth and soft now whereas before I always had little pesky bumps everywhere. It also seems like it made my skin very even in tone aside from the redness that I can't get to go away for longer than an hour :( I don't get oily much at all but I did notice that it controls the little oil I do produce throughout the day which is great!

The niacinamide does the job for me more than the azelaic acid does. I believe that both do similar things to the skin though (don't quote me on that lol it's just what I gathered from the research I did). I'm 30 and was on a pretty minimal skincare routine for a couple years (BHA cleanser and hyaluronic acid moisturizers) and I tried niacinamide earlier this month so the effects was kinda immediate. It's amazing on my skin and I'm someone who get burns and irritation and acne immediately when I use new products so I'm very cautious to what I put on my face. I feel like it strengthened my moisture barrier that my face started to feel normal; no dryness, no itching, no burns, no redness. I do get a mild purge from it but like every existing zits on my face became this tiny bumps that kinda erupt briefly before they dry out. It also mildly exfoliating my skin and cleared some of my years-old dark spots (I layered Alpha Arbutin at night for this specific purpose) and I do feel improvement before and after; my skin used to feel rough, now its so soft. Best part, I don't feel the need to layer more foundation when I go out. 

I'm also considering adding more acids in the future as I still have acne scars and texture irregularities. For now I'm researching the products and will get them once my skin get used to my current regimen. I feel Niacinamide does a lot of things that Azelaic acid said it do, so I probably get AHA/BHA then maybe retinols. Not OP, but I love TO's azelaic acid for my redness. I used to have redness on my cheeks and T-zone area that looked just a little milder than [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/a58rtm/skin_concerns_slightly_rough_and_red_skin/), and the azelaic acid helped me a lot with getting a more even tone (still, with a little pink throughout) but still smoother overall both color-wise and texture-wise. It's holy grail for me. I haven't used it much but now that you say it, I do remember it drying out my skin the few times I've used it. I don't think it was detrimental by any means but it's definitely something that should be mentioned. I'll edit it into my post just in case. Thank you for this information!! :) I agree it was crazy drying and the smell was off putting. Too bad because it‚Äôs so cute :( [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y6MGNQZ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_-5W5CbBYCRDNR)! I‚Äôm on mobile now so I hope the link works! It's such a bummer because it feels wonderful on my skin but once I rinse it off, there is no trace of me having even put on a mask. I want to like Glossier but all of their products have all been so underwhelming :( I have both the Hada Labo Premium lotion and the Holika Holika Good Cera Cream saved on my Amazon wishlist LOL I will definitely be purchasing those now because of you! Hydrating toners are so so lovely, I would not mind adding another one into my routine and I definitely need a ceramide in my life after what you have told me.

Sheet masks were always to "treat myself" but you convinced me to keep a steady supply of them around. I do really enjoy how they make my skin look! 

Thank you for this information, you are amazing! :) Totally fine! My question unfortunately didn't get answered so while I have you here, do you know if the formulas are the same? I really like it apart from the scent so it would be nice to get the same benefits without that. I used this moisturizer and LOVED it. Unfortunately I never repurchased it because I felt like I ran out of it very quickly and it's $30 in my area :(
Maybe I'll save up and buy it again because it really is incredible. It made my skin so plump!! Ooooh! I'm definitely going to check that out!! Maybe I can grab a sample or something. Thank you for the suggestion! I really appreciate it :) I think that the FR stuff is great for its price point as long as you can get passed the smell! Definitely worth checking out!
I used the Lush Oatifix mask religiously in the past but was never able to finish it before its expiration date which is such a bummer. I repurchased it 3 times before giving up lol. That was all before I was into skincare like I am now though so I might just try it again because I do remember it being great. It smelled so delicious too <3 I love what I've tried from Fourth Ray so far! I used up a whole Rose Face Milk and just started using Matcha. I LOVE the face milk - I use it in the AM before applying my moisturizer, I used it AS moisturizer for a bit but I need the extra boost afterwards. It makes me feel so dewy and glowy! I use their Skin Hero oil as my last step at night and I can't honestly tell if it has helped, but it doesn't hurt and I probably take a lot of oil out with my toner. I also have one of their face mists and enjoy a cool spritz now and then :) I can't really smell at all so no comment on the scent. I use it right after cleansing and toning and the moisturizers I use after applying it are mainly water-based, maybe that's why?? I'm not 100% sure tbh. Sorry I can't be more helpful :( Ugh! I have wanted that mask for a long time now but can't get myself to bite the bullet!! I'll grab a sample next time I hit Sephora! Thanks for the recommendation :) I'm definitely going to try that one! I love the formula as a daily moisturizer, it's very light and my makeup sits really well on top of it, I just can't stand the smell. It bugs me beyond belief. 
Thank you for your help! :) 55 ml (1.85 fl. oz) Ahh that sucks! I sleep in it in the winter time to keep my skin moisturized. :( I use a Kroger brand one and I'm certain it works as well as these lol, OTC formulas can only contain up to 10% of the active ingredient. I see, that's good to know then :) Thanks for the well wishes! The AA is the very last thing I put on after washing, toning, AHA-ing, etc. I feel like it seals all that in (if that makes sense) and keeps the grease down. I am not super-good at makeup so I don't use any kind of foundation, but I do use a stick brightening primer and powder over it before I move on blush and all that, and I never have any problems with it balling up, flaking or my makeup sticking to it in weird ways at all. 

I also use it at night so that my face isn't a complete oil slick when I wake up in the morning, and on nights when I don't, I really see a big difference. Because it's so good (for me) at controlling oil, I try to never run out of it. I buy them 3 or 4 at a time, and I cut the tops off the tube to get every last bit of product out before I throw it away and open a new one.   

I feel that after long-term (\~18 months) use, my skin is clearer, smoother, and nicer overall, although I can't say whether that's strictly because of the AA, or just because I've made a conscious effort to take care of my skin overall, but it's definitely not a step that I would ever drop from my routine. That sucks, I‚Äôm sorry!  Did it clear up when you quit using it? It's a very light chemical face peel that just takes away dead skin. I usually buy it through Amazon. Just a heads up, the hydro boost for extra-dry skin is fragrance free! That‚Äôs really neat! Thanks! I think I‚Äôd probably be the bare minimum type, thanks for the info! What results did you get from Niacinamide and how long did you use Azelaic acid til you decided to give it up?

Also how often do you apply Niacinamide ? no other chemical exfoliants! i am going to guess and say it‚Äôs purging. thanks for your help! I've always heard fantastic stuff about this stuff!! What other things does it do for your skin? I'm thinking about picking it up :) Ahhh I see, I think I might give it another go and test it on one side of my face and see how it reacts the next day because I have heard of amazing things about the toner!! Thank you for input üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è! Perfect thank you! Where do you usually get it? I know how it is to struggle between the cost and the love of the item! Skincare products especially. Thanks I concur. Eventually I got my skin used to the TO one enough to use it daily. I liked the Pixi one, but yeah I felt like it never quite did enough for me. thank you so much! yeha neither can I it's such a good product but wow I can't believe its lasted you a year! mine lasts like 1 month and a bit probably. the niacinamide lasts me foooooreeeveeer but the moisturiser lasts like 3 weeks ish? maybe more but it feels like such a short time zz Do you also use the niacinamide one? Your thoughts on the azelaic acid? I wanted to purch the glycolic toner but some reviews said it was pretty harsh on the skin, my skin is not that sensitive tho but would like to take it slow, i think my skin barriers not that great right now :( Before buying a product make sure to check it on skincarisma.com or any website that analyzes its ingredients. It‚Äôs a big help! I definitely feel I get the most out of my acids if I use a physical exfoliant every 2 weeks or so. I really really love the pixi peel and polish, my skin feels AMAZING after I use it! Honestly, I find facial physical exfoliator are more useful for my legs and back. That's how my not-working facial products get their second life. You're welcome and thanks for the contribution! I hope physical exfoliation gets its reputation back someday. Just like a lot of things in this world, it's not for everyone and it should be used in moderation! :) I got mine at the k beauty section at my local CVS! You‚Äôre welcome!! I‚Äôve seen people on here find other products in this line at Marshalls but I only found the oil unfortunately. I hope you can find some!! :) Omg this has absolutely convinced me! I use it on a daily basis! I think out of all the products I have used to improve the texture of my skin, this is the one that made the difference! It's brighter, softer, and much more even! I had these bumps all over my forehead and chin mainly that weren't pimples just tiny clusters of flesh toned bumps and it did wonders to get rid of them. My skin is very even now and definitely much brighter. 99% of my other products are just to hydrate my skin so I can confidently say that it's the niacinamide that did the work! :) Do you mix it with something else? Its so inelegant to apply I wish it worked on my redness but nothing ever has. Such a bummer :( I'm glad it worked for you though!! Oh no worries at all! I was just trying to tip you about how I make it work for me. :)  I loved your reviews! Thank you! Agreed! That mask just felt like I put like a thick/kinda gloopy moisturizer on for 20 minutes and then washed it off. I thought their cleanser was OK, but they aren‚Äôt investing enough in research and are relying too much on marketing/hype to sell skincare vs having genuinely good products! Yay, I hope those products work out for you!! Keep us updated üôÇ I sorta follow the Korean ‚Äúseven layer‚Äù skin routine‚Äì basically, layering on many hydrating toners and lighter lotions/emulsions. Helps keep my skin moisturized and happy! Another product I think contributes to glowy skin is actually snail mucin ‚Äì the cosRx 96 Snail Mucin is a holy grail product for me. Not sure if you have looked into this but just thought I should mention it!

I resisted sheet masks for a while because I thought they were expensive but if you order a bulk pack from Amazon they don‚Äôt have to be! I haven‚Äôt used the original one because fragrance in anything is usually a no-no for me. But from what I‚Äôve heard, people really enjoy both formulas.

The unscented one is a gel-cream vs a water gel like the scented one. I looked up the ingredients list and they look pretty similar to me, but the unscented one has synthetic beeswax in it. I think the unscented one is marketed towards really dry and sensitive skin, hence the no-fragrance.

I‚Äôve been using the gel-cream for about a week now, and I really like it! I‚Äôm super sensitive to fragrances so it‚Äôs nice that this doesn‚Äôt have one. It doesn‚Äôt sting at all, and I feel like it absorbs into my skin really well. It has even helped minimize some of my acne!

Your skin sounds just like mine, so hopefully the gel-cream works good for you! I live in little old New Zealand and I order two at a time to justify shipping. I find its easy to use too much although limiting myself to a fingertip sized amount has slowed me down! You could also just try buying a urea cream and hyaluronic acid separately? Definitely! I have also had to throw away expired Oatifix, but to be honest it's not a bad price point for such a nice mask so I dont really mind! Also I find that you dont really have to throw it away even if it's past the date as long as it hasnt gone moldy. I keep using mine as long as it looks and smells normal üòÇ Thank you for your input! I was struggling to figure out where to put the Watermelon Face Milk in my routine! Guess I‚Äôll add yet another moisturizer in there lol I can never get enough hydration haha what matcha product are you referring to? is there a matcha face milk?? I actually reached out to Deciem about this and they suggested using less product. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt using much at all but now that I‚Äôve started using even less it‚Äôs happening much less frequently! If you like the sample, I've got a birthday voucher for cult beauty (that I'm not using) you can use to get 15% off üòä Yup as soon as I stopped it I didn‚Äôt get anymore cystic bumps. I even tried to use it on my chest since it gets congested sometimes but that broke out too üò≠ Ended up just giving it to my roomie I like the sound of that! Thanks for your help :) Oooh! I didn't know they had another formula. Apart from the scents, do you know if they are they the same? It got rid of all my pesky, little, flesh colored bumps and made my skin appear brighter and just generally more clear and smooth.

I ceased using the azelaic acid roughly a month in. I felt that I was getting better results with the niacinamide and didn't feel it was necessary. It's different for everyone though :) Totally purges your pores which for me makes them appear smaller because they are no longer clogged. I also had some cystic acne and it definitely sped up the healing process. It is intense but very effective. Your skin is quite red after especially your first time using so I would make sure I do it before bed than apply moisturizing oils. I use the Drunk elephant virgin marula luxury facial oil, for an example. I mix the clay with apple cider vinegar, for the first time I left it on only 5-10 minutes to see how my skin would react. You're welcome! I hope it works for you!! Good luck <3 I asked for it for Christmas last year so I'm dreading running out of it and having to buy it myself :( I believe it was purchased at Sephora! I definitely recommend grabbing a sample from them! Oooh I love Pixi so I'm definitely picking that one up!! Physical exfoliants deserve more love <3
Thanks for the recommendation!! That‚Äôs a really good tip! Dermalogica has a great physical microfoliant. Its rice based with salicylic acid,colloidal oatmeal,papain, tea, licorice and allantoin. I use it 2 -3 x wk. Very gentle as these products go. Do all CVS's have a k beauty section and if so, do they have good products?? I don't have a CVS in my area unfortunately but I would totally drive out to the closest one just for that lol My best friend got hers at the same place. CVS has a pretty good K beauty selection depending on location/size! I have the exact same flesh toned bumps!! that sounds amazing. you pushed me over the edge, going to purchase rn!! :) This is pretty much my struggle right now. I just bought & started their Glycolic acid, but thinking this is more what I need. Also have the bumps too... been trying everything to work on them the past few months with no luck. Ordering this for sure! I agree, the texture of the products is... odd but no, I do not mix it! I usually mix mine with my moisturizer and it's far less sticky Just came here to say this- they know how to hype but they don't have the research to back it up. Their Solution was promising but its ingredients are drying and irritating and not elegant at all. I have heard of the cosrx snail mucin but never really looked into it! I‚Äôll be doing that now though. I can‚Äôt pass up a glowy skincare product :)
In your experience, are sheet masks a dime a dozen or are there some that are better than others? What bulk pack do you recommend? I will definitely check out the unscented one in the future! Thank you so much! You have been so helpful :) Very true! Knowing that I can use it past its expiration date has definitely swayed me towards trying it again lol I am definitely not above using expired stuff as long as it's not moldy hahaha Yes they have a Matcha Face Milk!! Yes!! They have rose, matcha, and now watermelon face milk :) That sounds great!! My pores could definitely use some purging. I will definitely be picking this up! Thanks for the recommendation :) Yes I have been using this clay for 2 weeks, at first I wanted to use it every single day but I had to take a step back and be like ok stop being so obsesssed, so now im trying to spread the uses out a bit more lols I might have to add it to my birthday list haha. Most of my list consists of skincare products ha. I will definitely have to go grab a sample. Any other recommendations of holy Grail products? I want to have a basic regimen of at least a moisturizer with sunscreen, a serum, a gentle cleanser, and a moisturizer/cream at night. But there are so many products out there!! That sounds lovely! I might have to try a sample of it. The price is a little crazy but I don't physically exfoliate much so it would last me forever, I'm sure!! Plain rice bran works just as well without the hefty price tag! That stuff is amazing! It works really well. If it's a big CVS, then yes! Some smaller ones might, but maybe not as big a selection. The K beauty section mostly has cutesy, well packaged products, but it also has some winners. Worth going if you like novel skincare or makeup. Call them before you go to find out. YAY!! I hope it's a little miracle worker for you as well!! :) I have the same bumps on my forehead so I‚Äôll definitely be getting this!!! I would definitely give it a try then!! :) Awesome! I'm gonna have to try it that way then. I personally think they‚Äôre a dime a dozen but others may disagree! üòÇ A personal favorite of mine are the Tony Moly ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Real‚Äù sheet masks! There are so many ‚Äúflavors‚Äù so you can really try out a bunch. The latest sheet masks I have been using are the Tosowoong ‚ÄúPure‚Äù sheet masks and I have liked them a lot because the mask is made of a thicker material. People also love the Papa Recipe honey sheet masks, I think they‚Äôre nice but due to the honey can be kind of sticky so not sure if I would repurchase lol. Check out r/AsianBeauty I‚Äôm sure they have more recommendations! Just wanted to add, based on your skin description our skin types are almost exactly the same haha. I really liked the Neutrogena ultra dry moisturizer, it's probably my favorite drug store option. My skin will get a bit "stingy" too with certain scents, especially after exfoliation and I had no problems with it :) The Klairs Supple Preparation toner is a holy grail! It leaves my skin plump and hydrated. I definitely recommend adding a toner into your regimen!! It‚Äôs a step that I can‚Äôt live without! The Ordinary‚Äôs niacinamide is also a HG product for me. It makes my skin even, brighter, and softer!
My favorite moisturizer so far is the Hado Labo Skin Plumping Gel. I haven‚Äôt repurchased it yet because I don‚Äôt have the money, but it‚Äôs incredible!!! It‚Äôs so moisturizing and it makes me skin look so plump. I love it so much :‚Äô)
I can‚Äôt comment on a cleanser as I haven‚Äôt found one I loved yet and I haven‚Äôt tested out any other sunscreens than the one pictured so I can‚Äôt give an opinion on that either but everyone says the one I‚Äôm using (Etude House Sunprise) is fantastic!! I only buy the mini sizes of it, and when it is on sale. I'm a sucker for cutesy packaging haha thank you! I'm gonna check it out! :) That's probably a good idea lol I really like the Tony Moly ones as well!! I love the variety they have. I'll definitely stock up on those then :)
Thanks for your help! That‚Äôs great news!! Thank you so much!! :) Awesome, this is really helpful! I definitely want to add a toner later, but I'm going to slowly add products (for money and my skin gets used to the changes). So that information will definitely come in handy. I tried a more intense skin regimen (right now I'm only doing sunscreen/moisturizer in the morning, facewash, serum, and moisturizer at night because I'm traveling) in the past, like a 7 step approach but my skin freaked out with all of the sudden additions. I realize now that I probably should have slowly introduced them haha. Anyway,thanks for the advice! I'd love to know if you have any updates! How long does a mini last for you? I will do my best to update you on anything on my shelf that you might need in your life! Thank you and good luck on your journey!! :) About 12 wks. I really use a tiny amount and I concentrate mainly on t zone. You can also mix it in your cleanser. That‚Äôs not bad at all! I‚Äôm definitely gonna check it out. Thanks :) I get the travel sized ones too. They last me a long time! If you're getting back into physical exfoliants, it's a nice one to try. **Hello everyone!**

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I love how it is organized and easy to access all the products.

&#x200B;

I also add fun face masks here and there when I'm feeling it, or in the winter when I get really dry.

&#x200B;

I have recently added The Ordinary products and Tatcha The Essence to my routine, and I have finally maintained a good moisture barrier. My mother started me on skincare at 11 years old, and I worked in a cosmetics and skincare shop while in college, so I have been trying to refine my routine for a long time. My skin changed almost overnight when I turned 20 from normal to dry as the desert and sensitive due to health issues. At 34, I have the best skin of my life.I wear full coverage makeup almost every day, but do not have a single blemish.

&#x200B;

Normally every morning, I will pick off dry flakes of skin before applying moisturizer and makeup. Once I added The Essence to my routine, that was a thing of the past! The larger, milia-like bumps at my hairline and forehead are gone. My skin actually did plump, which I thought was honestly going to be just empty product promise. I wanted to not like it. It's ridiculously expensive, but damnit, it works.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of people don't like Tatcha due to the price. I get it, but their newer products just work so well for my skin. My skin that is incredibly picky about what I put on it. When I wake up in the morning, I can still feel the layer of moisture on my skin from The Indigo Cream. No other moisturizer has ever done that for me, and I sleep on my face. For anyone who loves this, have you heard about the god that Korean tabletop makeup organizers?  Game changer. Link for ease. Not affiliated or anything. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0721PCG3H/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_WEKKDbG0BJPNN Weird question but why do you keep it next to your bed and not do it in the bathroom? Love the lazy susan idea! Yes! Nexflix‚Äôn Skincare. This is so simple and mind-blowing at the same time. Heading to Amazon to purchase... I'm surprised the Indigo Cream doesn't get more love on here. It's super nice, I love it. This is an obscene level of decadence. üòÇ This is mad genius u/TheBreat where did you buy it/which brand is it? I also am looking for one but the acrylic ones seems like I will keep knocking them down. I love that this has ‚Äúhigh railings‚Äù. TIA  OP=üß†üß† Love this idea!!! That‚Äôs an awesome idea! And saves so much space without having to put products behind each other. Might have to steal it üëÄ Doing this ASAP Gah! Steal! Such a cute idea :) Awesome idea! I would like something like this. I will see what I can repurpose to do something similar I'd  sure like to have one of those.... GENIUS BRILLIANT An innovator.
I might (will) borrow this idea. Omg I love this idea!! Might steal it :) Where did you get this one from?? This. Is. BRILLIANT. So long knocking everything off the nightstand! How do you like the Indie Lee toner?? I‚Äôve been eying it but I‚Äôm not sure if I should purchase or not This is genius!! I love the idea! Where did you get your dining table lazy susan? placing my order rn This. Is. Brilliant. Adorable! Love it Also may I add your nails are awesome Lol, I didn't think that doing your skincare routine in bed was actually a thing until I saw Hyram Q&A video where someone told him when is the skincare for lazy people video coming out. Ouuuuu. Dis a good idea This is what I've needed my whole life!!!!!!!!! Why have I not thought of this before?! Thank you! Love this idea :) Nice! I guess this whole lazy Susan style is the most common for skincare. I ended up ordering the jerry box I keep seeing off amazon tonight. Excited to finally have some organization! I wish I had one of these for my bedside right now! I just broke my leg and my dresser, where my skincare stuff usually lives, is a pain in the ass to hobble over to. I absolutely love it!! I love repurposing stuff! Great for the environment too :) I would honestly buy this off of you because I can't find any one like that anywhere. All that I could find was either flat without rails or some ugly grey plastic. I am gutted. If your skin is free of blemishes, why do you still go for a full coverage makeup look? Is it a fun hobby or do you like how it looks? No shade I‚Äôm honestly curious I really do use the spinning part to get to the products! I was just going to get a tray to keep my cats from knocking off everything, but this works even better. It's also heavier, so they can't knock the whole container over like if I used a small bin. [deleted] That's what I was going to buy! Then my husband brought this out, and I figured I might as well use it for something! Woah! Thanks for the link! I have been thinking about getting some sort of shelf organizer sort of things but have been stalling on actually buying something Wow, you just changed my life with this. Thanks for the link! I have this! It‚Äôs fairly customizable and very easy to set up and take down. Super sturdy too. Love it! I used to keep it all in the bathroom for years. I have chronic fatigue and pain, so one night I washed my face at the sink, and was so tired, that I just grabbed the rest of my routine, and took it to bed to finish. After a few nights of it sitting on my nightstand, I found it really relaxing to do it while winding down for bed, and now I much prefer it this way. I love how it's called a lazy Susan That's what I do! Netflix or YouTube videos while slathering my skin. I can't take credit for the idea. I saw someone on here post an acrylic, multi-tiered one from Amazon, and I was about to order one, when my husband grabbed this from the kitchen. It was going unused, and honestly, I like the heavy weight to it more than the light acrylic to combat my cats. I think maybe because the price is daunting and prohibitive. So worth it, though. I have a second jar on the way. It feels so good. It‚Äôs Target‚Äôs Home brand. I bought it a couple years ago, so I‚Äôm not sure if they still have them. I wish I could take credit! I saw someone post an acrylic one in their bathroom, and my husband pulled this from the kitchen. So it was their genius! Target from the tableware section a few years ago And my cats doing so as well! I have a 14 pounder that always knocks my stuff everywhere! I really like it. This bottle is actually empty. I kept it in here to remind me to order another bottle. I don‚Äôt like the tingly toners. My skin is sensitive, so they usually end up feeling like they are burning my face. This one is gentle. Some people want that tingly sensation, so it‚Äôs just something to keep in mind if you are looking for that. From Target in their tableware section a few years ago. Not sure if they still have them. Thank you! I do them myself, so that means a lot! Makeup is a hobby, but also my cheeks turn red at the drop of a hat. They turn bright red just from me being hot, a strong wind, if I scratch an itch, etc. Full coverage foundation is the only thing that covers it until it calms down or I cool off. If I scratch an itch on my arm or something, I have bright marks left behind. Also unrelated but I love your nails. Great idea! Ah, finding ways to store things that the cats can't knock over. The eternal struggle... I think it is a combination of a couple of things. One is proper cleansing. This is making sure that when I am wearing makeup, to *always* double cleanse with an oil followed by a water-based, creamy cleanser. I used to use the REN EverCalm cleansing milk before the First Aid Beauty one I have now, but after a few full bottles took a tumble in the shower making them unusable, I switched. When I skip a cleanser with makeup, I will get white heads.

When I was getting cystic acne years ago, the two best things that helped with the PIH was daily sunscreen and using hydrocolloid bandages after extraction. I would have PIH for weeks after a blemish, but with the bandage, it would be gone in a day or so. I don't use these bandages much anymore, since I don't really get whiteheads anymore with this routine.

Allow me to do a PSA moment, because it made such a difference for me. I haven't had huge issues with acne even as a teen. But for about 4 years in my late 20's, I was getting cystic acne suddenly. I tried so many things, and could not figure out why I was suddenly getting this huge, painful spots. I can't remember how I stumbled upon it, but I discovered that somewhere along the way, I had got some bacteria in a whitehead that had then spread through all my jarred products and face powders. I threw out everything that I dipped my hand in, or was like a face powder, and didn't come out of a pump to avoid contamination. I always wash my hands before applying makeup and skincare, but it made no difference. This bacteria was incredibly resistant, and had spread. Once I got new products that pumped, or only used those little spatulas, the cystic acne disappeared. Those spatulas are my best friends! It has been 5 years, and not a single cystic acne spot ever since.

I also get blemishes from not exfoliating. It's why I'm still a fan of very gentle physical exfoliation included in a routine with chemical exfoliation. The Tatcha rice polish really helps slough off the dead, dry skin without the irritation. When I paired it with the glycolic acid toner, my skin is so much smoother.

For PIE, colloidal oatmeal as an ingredient really helped me. I tend to get a lot of redness from abrasion and allergies. First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream has it as an active ingredient as well as the Tatcha Indigo cream, but I notice the Tatcha's moisture lasts much longer on my skin. When I started using products with oatmeal, I noticed a big difference in my redness.

That was terribly long-winded. I'm sorry.

**TL:DR;** Double cleansing with the oil and water-based method and exfoliation were the biggest help on blemishes for me. PIH was by far sunscreen and hydro colloid bandages. The milia was including an Asian essence product. PIE is greatly helped with colloidal oatmeal. That Indigo Cream is just so soothing. Skincare spatulas are life. Well I guess it makes sense, since you don't need to wash anything off... I'll try it sometime haha I love doing my nighttime skincare in bed too!! I also find that I never skip any steps no matter how tired I am because it‚Äôs right there on my nightstand. I have literally no excuse. So do I! I keep all my products that need water in my bathroom and everything else in my bedroom. I love kicking back and watching a show while doing skincare. Soooo relaxing! Now I‚Äôm on the hunt to find one exactly like this! Thank you! Doing my nails is a big hobby for me. Question with using spatulas. Is this correct? 
1. you use the spatula to remove the product from the container 2. You rub the spatula on your fingers to apply the product to your face. 3. Do you then wash the spatula? You are an angel. Thank you for this! Can do the whole routine bedside with micellar water '-')b That's pretty close to what I do. I will admit I don't fully clean the spatula after every use. What I do is have my hands washed (at least 30 seconds of suds at the sink), and then I remove product from the container, apply to the back of my hand, and then I either clean it with a wet wipe (I have a baby, so there are always wipes around), or I wash it. I then use what is on the back of my hand to apply it on my face. I usually clean it every few uses. I haven't had any contamination issues from doing this like I had before. yes, this is what i do! i can't stand for very long and need to be in bed most of the time anyway, so having it all there is so helpful. Hi there!

I am 24F, my skin type is pretty average, I have stress breakouts but not anything extreme. My biggest concern in terms of my skin is that I work a job with long hours in a setting that is, as delicately as I can put it, just incredibly dirty.

I get up for work at 4am and don't get back home until 7:30pm, so at this point I would like to find some sort of undereye cream to help with shadows/the lines I'm getting, if anyone has a product that has helped them there, I would appreciate it!

Here is my routine with short reviews:

AM-

**Formula 10.0.6 So Totally Clean Pore Cleanser** I namely use this to give myself a clean feeling foundation right when I wake up. I adore this stuff, my face generally used to feel a lot more oily before I started using it.

**Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Moisturizer** I picked up a moisturizer because of reading it a million times on this subreddit, I also picked up a PM moisturizing cream. I love them both, my skin feels a lot healthier and I was worried that this specifically would break me out, and it's done the exact opposite. I can see a difference in the clarity of my skin since I started using it.

**Neutrogena sunscreen** I just started using this one, and it is super liquidy. It runs a lot. But once you wrangle it enough to get it on your face, it doesn't feel heavy. So, very watery and smells funky like sunscreen, but hey. It works.

**Vaseline lip cream** Old faithful, but with a spin. I stopped using any other lip product because I love the way this makes my lips feel soft, but if any of you have a good suggestion for a lip balm with sunscreen in it, I would appreciate that!

PM-

**Equate makeup wipes** Pretty standard, but they work. My eyes are really sensitive to a lot of other brands, the Simple brand ones make my eyes sting for a while after using them and these don't, so I'm fine with them.

**Cetaphil Facial Cleanser** I heard on a podcast one time that the girl I was listening to went to the dermatologist and they told her they recommend this to everyone because it's very gentle and it works for most skin types. I'm not wild about it, but I've been using it on that second hand suggestion and it's fine. I'm interested in trying Cerave, so if you have experience with that, I'd love to hear it! 

**Formula 10.0.6 P.M. Perfector Overnight Hydrating Cream** I really love this brand's products. 

Thanks for sticking with me and reading/looking at my post! I would love to hear any products you all think would be good to add/switch out, but keeping in mind that I have limited time, so I can't do much that has to have extended time periods to set during the routine. :) That green moisturizer is my favoriteeeee I love the vaseline lip stuff! I can also recommend the Jack Black lip balm. It's a bit pricey, though (I think 7 or 8 bucks), but it has spf 25 and feels so nice! If you're not in an area where they sell it, it appears you can get it on Amazon.

Also, I love the cerave hydrating cleanser. It is unscented and kinda no frills, but my sensitive skin tolerated it well. I do have dry skin, though, so ymmv. Love that cleanser. And OT but how does one become a railroad worker? This makes me want to try the PM overnight cream! Do you love it, like it? 
The nighttime moisturizer I‚Äôm currently using is about out but too expensive for me to buy again. about the eye cream. this really famous AB blogger(Fiddy Snails) uses Cosrx 92 Snail All in One Cream for undereye fine lines and i found it perfect for me too. maybe you could try that? Nice.  I love those tiny Vaselines.  I have the rose one too and a cr√©eme br√ªl√©e one Nice shelfie! :). BTW The Ordinary has great skin treatments with a high end feel but drugstore price. I also have that sunscreen but I hate the smell. I‚Äôve been using Matrixyl from TO and it‚Äôs been a miracle worker for my lines. Supposed to work well on dark spots as well I think but that‚Äôs not an issue for me lately. It goes on cold too and just feels so amazing. I have deep forehead wrinkles (thanks Dad) & I wish I had this 15 years ago. railroad worker? ya'll hiring??? This is totally off topic but what does being a railroad worker exactly entail? Sounds really cool to me :) I like your shelfie. I think drugstore products are where it's at. After years of only using fancy stuff and then getting really into naturals, I've come back to the drugstore, tail between legs, wondering why I ever strayed. It's been a year of only drugstore, and my skin is looking the best it has in 15 years!

Anyway! Tangent aside. I just wanted to mention eye creams for undereye circles: I really like the Burt's Bees Brightening one for daytime, and it's pretty affordable at least online. I also recommend a retinol one used maybe just two nights a week considering your young age. I use the Avene one, which is pricey, but I'd look into Neutrogena or RoC's for drugstore. I‚Äôve got fair oily skin and I‚Äôm in LOVE with CeraVe hydrating cleanser. I got a little sample-size bottle from Bed, Bath, & Beyond for like $3 and it‚Äôs lasted me over a month, morning and night cleansing. I highly recommend it!!! I‚Äôve been using CeraVe‚Äôs AM and the Ultra-light Moisturizing Lotion with SPF, but both broke me out a bit.  I just got La Roche Posay‚Äôs dry-touch sunscreen and I‚Äôm a big fan, but I‚Äôve only been using it for a few days so jury is out as to how it‚Äôll effect my skin. Just wanted to give my 2 cents. Also, I respect your hustle- you‚Äôve got this! Bet your skin looks good. Also, never be ashamed of honest work. I use that formula toner as well and love it. I‚Äôve also started using that Vaseline as a night time eye cream and it does wonders. Those frangrance free equate wipes are bomb! I love them! I really like trying new products so I was looking into them. Does that moisturizer help quite a bit with oiliness? I‚Äôm okay for a couple hours during the day after I wash my face but after that point I‚Äôm shiiiiiiiny. Formula 10.0.6 is my go to for moisturizer and face masks! An affordable gem!! Ole Henrikksen eye cream for the win!! A literal game changer. Super spendy but you need so little! I like this, this seems like a really normal, good set of stuff to use.

I see people with shelfies of about 20 things and it just seems insane. formula 10.0.6 is my favorite skincare brand!!! they are amazing! I'm a guy, but rhe rose vasoline lip balm is a godsend! The softest lip for days and the tub lasts forever i also use this cleanser. :3 scared to switch it up formula 10.0.06 is my favourite ü§© Omg I use that vaseline lip mosturizer too, it's the absolute best. I have probably like 10 scattered between my house and work. Neutrogena Revitalizing Lip Balm is great! Very sheer color, spf 20, moisturizing enough I don't feel like I need anything else.  I've tried and like the Sunny Berry and Fresh Plum.  A little expensive for what it is, but still only like $7. [removed] my friend and i both used that sunscreen and it gave us such horrible breakouts! i know some people who use it with no problems though. i now use neutrogena sport face [removed] Doesn‚Äôt the Cetaphil facewash have parabens in it? Woof. I appreciate the shiiiiit out of your hustle, but those are some rough hours. I hope you get some decent downtime. Adequate rest > any serum 

Sorry to preach, I'm not scolding you or anything, I'm just on a tear over how overworked most of us are and will take any reason to fume over this stuff, lol Hey Im a railroad worker too!!! Skincare railroaders unite! I used to use that sunscreen until it broke me out in tiny little pimples all over my face, but I heard that for some people it works fine for them Mostly just came here to say thank you for the work you do! It‚Äôs important work, and there are not a lot of women doing that work, so more power to you! I used to work for a transit agency & railroad (31F). Mostly office work but I occasionally had to go into the field. I have a ton of respect for people like you who are out there working crazy hours every day in all kinds of weather. Definitely keep up with the sunscreen. If you are supposed to wear a hard hat then DEFINITELY wear it at all times. It‚Äôs great sun protection, not to mention brain protection. Not much you can do about the dirty environment...particularly in the tunnels! It‚Äôs pretty nasty down there. Maybe leave some of those wipes in your locker or just rinse with warm water whenever you can. And resist the urge to touch your face if it‚Äôs sweaty and grimy. Good luck with everything and, most importantly, please be safe out there!!

Edit: I read some more comments and realize you are a Collector. Was thinking maybe a track worker. So the hard hat comment doesn‚Äôt apply, but the sentiment remains the same: sun protection and safety are key :-) Malibu do SPF 30 flavoured lip balm. Only one I've found that doesn't taste like sunscreen but is higher than SPF15 Just wanted to say you rock!  I‚Äôm impressed with your tenacity.   Also, my family loves the 10.0.06 pore cleanser; we all use it.  Doesn't dry me out and I‚Äôm an older person. My wife also works on a railway and her face gets incredibly dirty! She finds it really hard to get a clean face after work, last time she was home she bought some makeup remover wipes to help out. She was using cerave moisturizer (the tub stuff) but found it irritated her skin (although I think this was the combined fact of working in Canadian winters and having to deal with a super dryness).
I‚Äôm going to send her this thread to help her out. Thanks so much for sharing. For eye creams look for ones with caffeine or ginseng! That seems to make the biggest difference for people but it‚Äôs still controversial in this sub so YMMV. Personally I‚Äôve been using Biossance‚Äôs (ordered their free sample) and like it. But will probably move to TO‚Äôs caffeine serum cause it‚Äôs a hell of a lot cheaper. Origins has a ginseng eye cream I‚Äôve been eyeing too. 

Also cold compress on the eyes will help. I have a frozen eye mask but cold spoons work just as well. I use Skinfix Eye Brightening cream. 
I‚Äôve used Peter Thomas Roth, OLEHENRIKSEN, and it cosmetics in the past and they don‚Äôt come close to how good Skinfix has been for me. 

For eye masks I use Skyn Iceland once a week I‚Äôve tried countless numbers of products. I‚Äôve tried the Cerave gentle cleanser and it is pretty much the same thing as the Cetaphil but I Cetaphil a little more. I felt like the Cerave didn‚Äôt make me feel as clean as other products. I use Baby Lips by Maybelline for chap stick with sunscreen! It‚Äôs 20 SPF, it‚Äôs the one in the blue tube and it smells good. 

Since you asked about CeraVe, about 2-3 weeks ago I started used CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser. It‚Äôs extremely gentle and works well for my sensitive combination skin. It‚Äôs one of three recommended cleansers by Curology too! I usually like to jump around a try different cleaners for my face, but I will probably stick with this one! Banana Boat has a lip balm with aloe vera and vitamin e, with a spf 45 uva/uvb protection. Sadly, I didn't have the luck you have with the Formula 10.0.6 Cleanser :( It dried my skin so much. Their sunscreen wasn't my favorite either... Maybe, I'll try the moisturizers but, idk, after those fails with the other two products? I'm kinda hesitant. YMMV though! :) Hello fellow rail lady! Same age too haha. 

Palmers cocoa butter balms have SPF 15, plus they're affordable, sold at most pharmacies (in Australia anyway) and smells like chocolate. No pink pigment like your Vaseline though unfortunately, but when I put the balm as my bottom layer and add a touch of lipstick on top it stays on all day. (I don't put more than a dot, I prefer a little pinkness as opposed to a full lipcolour) I have pretty sensitive skin sometimes and found that a damp reusable makeup removal cloth removes my makeup, saves money, and prevents extra waste from going to the landfill. you use two cleansers? also if you do try out cerave can you please post an update? i would like to know if it's better than cetaphil :-) I adore it! I love that their brand is so affordable too, so I can run through it and not feel bad. Seconding the Jack Black lip balm. Feels great and it comes in a tube so it stays nice and clean. 2nd for Jack Black lip balm! I love it and hate to use anything else. 

P.S. Generally they come out with multipacks during the winter holiday season and those can be cheaper per piece. Thank you for the suggestions! I'll give them both a try, my facial cleanser is a few days away from used up. Off topic is fine!

Honestly, I just went for it and applied for the lowest tier position in the transportation side and somehow got lucky enough to get it. I'm a Collector right now, but will eventually be promoted to either Conductor or Engineer. I'm pushing/studying for becoming an Engineer, that's the position where you actually run the movement of the train. It's an amazing job, the best one I've ever had, and I'm aware that a fair amount of luck came my way to have landed it. 

*(But also keep in mind that it's very long hours, living on call is a big part of it and it's certainly not for the faint of heart.)* I absolutely love it! It's not crazy expensive, like anything Formula 10.0.6, I think it's like $10 and it lasts me a long time! I love the way it smells, it has a fast application/drying time, I use a spatula to put the product on my skin and I just love how my face feels when I wake up! It's worth the try, I would suggest it to anyone. Thank you for that suggestion! I'll take a look at it, I love that it's an all in one. I have both as well and I adore them! I love the rose, it adds a hint of color while still looking super natural. :) Thank you!

That's awesome! I feel like I've heard that name, I really appreciate the suggestion! I don‚Äôt mind the smell but it completed melted my eyeliner off! It does have just a strange funk. I don't love feeling like that's eminating off my face. Ooo, thank you for this suggestion! Lines+dark spots are my big issues, I really appreciate it. Look into it in your area! I genuinely did not think I was going to get this job when I applied, but I'm here now and I couldn't be more thankful. It's an amazing job. Long hours, stressful, super worth it. Off topic is fine!

My current job is the simplest in transportation, but it does take a lot of knowledge of the railroad to work any position in this area.

There are a ton of railroads in America, but most of them follow a similar format of "entry position for a few years and then promoted to a licensed position" for the people you actually see working the trains you ride. I came in with zero background in this area and have been fortunate enough to be surrounded by a ton of knowledgeable people who have taught me everything I know. There are a lot of facets of the job I work, but the biggest thing for anyone working these jobs is safety. Your safety, our safety, the safety of the people doing construction on the rails. There's a decent amount of base level work that goes into ensuring that. Otherwise, I'm in a position where I collect tickets/oversee the cars I work in a consist. The job I'm working towards is Engineering, and that's running the movement of the train. It's the best job I've ever had, and while it's not easy, I'm fortunate to have it. :) Hahah, I love it! No shame in humble products when they work.

Thank you for these suggestions! Thank you for this input! Cerave's Hydrating Cleanser is officially the next on my list to try.

Also, I appreciate it! :) I work hard at it. Proud of my clear skin and my hard earned position, thank you! :) I've never thought to do that, I'll have to give it a shot! They are my standard buy! I used to buy the Formula 10.0.6 Wipe Your Face Off makeup wipes, but the fragrance in those also bothered my eyes. I love how cheap and reliable they are. I love trying new stuff too! I'll look into them for sure! I also have a natural shine and I never wore foundation or any kind of powder to cover it up because that would break me out. I started wearing this and someone said I look like I always have a filter on. lol. I think that's overdoing it, but it does noticeably cut down on my Rudolph shiny nose! Yes! The price point for all of their products is exactly reasonable and their multi pack masks are my favorite, you get to try all of them in small quantities and I love it! How long have you used it? I'm glad you've had good results from it, I definitely need to check it out! Thank you! It's modest, but that's like me. Too many things and I know I would check out and just stop using them. Amazing and affordable! I suggest them to pretty much everyone I know Everyone should use it, it's seriously such a blessing during harsh winters! I'm also a little scared, but I'm going to try some trial/travel sizes of the products people have suggested and see what works best for my skin! Hi there,

Thank you! I'll check it out! You are correct. SLS as well, that's why I'm not wild about it. :/ You're exactly right. It'll be a while until I have enough seniority to have a job with good hours though, so I've gotta do what I've gotta do until then, ya know? I'm also mid trying-to-get my life-together with my diet and exercise, but I do make it a point to do everything I can throughout the day (I have a split between my runs where I eat/workout/shower) so I can get 7-8 hours of sleep on weekday nights and then I sleep in on weekends. :) Saw your request for issues around your eyes. I love, love, love Olay's Eye Gel. It comes in a purple box, the gel is clear. I started to get crows feet and the skin under my eyes was getting darker - all fixed up. I've been using it for about a year on and off, put it on at night, it took a month to notice a difference, but now my eyes look great! United! :) You know what? I am getting tiny pimples on my forehead lately, which is not a normal breakout zone for me. If you don't mind me asking, what do you use now? Same here! It gave me tiny bumps all over my whole body. Highly recommend Cetaphil or Cerave as well. I suspected this sunscreen caused tiny little pimples for me but it was hard to know because I introduced different products too close together, including cerave moisturiser.. But it seems like a few people have had these problems with the neutrogena.... hmmm! I appreciate it! You're right, my work is on the trains, not the rails, although I've got a ton of respect for people who work out there as well.
I keep a significant stock of wet wipes and sanitizers, the train itself is not the cleanest place, but nowhere near the level of working in tunnels! There's more and more women in transportation. :) Thank you for the suggestion! I'll try it out for sure. Thank you so much! Gotta push hard if I want to be an Engineer (which is what I'm working towards)!

That deep pore cleanser is my favorite product on my shelf. :) So sweet!

It is a super dirty job regardless of how you go about it. My biggest thing at first was touching my face, but after enough times of washing my hands and having the water run black for a while before they looked normal, you really don't want to touch anything on yourself. lol. I hope this thread helps her as much as all these suggestions are helping me! :) I didn't know creams with caffeine existed! Huh. TIL.

I was thinking about getting an eye mask for cold compresses, but didn't know if that would actually make a difference. Thank you for that suggestion. It's at least worth trying! I'll look it up, thank you! :) Ya it's designed to be a bit more hydrating but some people feel like it leaves a film. I like it more for people with dry skin but Cetaphil is def better on oilier tones That's interesting. I think I'll buy a smaller size of it and see how it works with my skin! I used to use the blue Baby Lips all the time, I'm not sure when I strayed away and honestly not sure why either. I remember liking it a lot, I didn't realize it had sunscreen though!

That's a great insight, thank you! Didn't know that at all, that sounds like a miracle product! Oh for sure their standard daily cleanser dried my skin out. I didn't try their sunscreen, but I totally get you there. That's why I picked up that Cetaphil standard cleanser, I think I'm going to try Cerave next though because my Cetaphil is almost out and I've seen so much positive feedback for that! Hey there! What a coincidence, hahah!

I also prefer a slight tint to appear close to a natural color. That's a great solution and definitely worth trying. (I love anything that smells great!) Oof, this response is late!

I use a Cetaphil as a regular face wash and then the Formula 10.0.6 Deep Pore Cleanser is like an astringent- just a cleansing liquid for your face. I really love that and it's my favorite part of my routine because it makes my skin feel the cleanest. I'll update if I give Cerave a shot, I've been using Clinique lately because it was a gift from my sister! :) Good info to keep in mind! I really need to give this a try. What does a collector do? Does it help with the moisture barrier and gives a lot of hydration? I'm looking into a cream/moisturizer that provides that. I have combo-oily, sensitive skin that is prone to redness and dehydration (during the dry months mostly) or oily (during the summer)... Came here to ask about this!  Where did you find them?!  I use plain for my lips, I never even heard of these but am so excited about this discovery! Not sure what you have access to, but if you like the watery application, try one of the Japanese brands (shiseido, etc) They never have the sunscreen smell but go on smooth, no greasey feel at all.

(all in my experience) It‚Äôs so cheap too!  Under $10. You‚Äôre welcome : ) why do you think you got it when it's usually thousands of applicants for 30 positions? Good to know! Thank you :) I'd say about 6 weeks now. Just a deluxe sample and I'm maybe halfway through! Has changed my first world/self obsessed day to day life üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôve been using this for years. Wish I had paid closer attention to the ingredients. I thought it was ‚Äúapproved.‚Äù It‚Äôs really shocking tbh. My sister was the queen of breakouts. She would constantly apply so much of this vigorously only to notice that it didn‚Äôt make any difference. I used it once and I didn‚Äôt like how it smelt. That‚Äôs why I kind of cringed when I saw that in the picture lol. I know that it‚Äôs not that cheap but I‚Äôd suggest you to discard it from your routine. Also, just have one last look at all the ingredients in every product. :) Can I ask what you‚Äôre doing for exercise? I have similar hours and it‚Äôs definitely a hassle trying to eat healthy and getting in a good workout. Thank you so much! I'm saving up a list of all the suggested items, but I love that you've had actual experience with it working for you. Thank you! I've noticed my dark circles becoming more prominent, unfortunately, I'll give this a try :) Try Cetaphil or Cerave moisturizer with sunscreen. My dermatologist recommends both brands Derm here. Guessing you're not wearing a hat a lot or anything. I think Clear Face is pretty good for acne but I also really like EltaMD UV Clear - it's extremely thin and not prone to creating breakouts. Also, you could use an SPF with retinol to keep those pores open. One that isn't too expensive is Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer With Retinol SPF. It's only SPF 20 but if you're not getting out much (with your schedule), a nickel-sized amount will be plenty adequate. 

Last option would be to use a glycolic wash just on your forehead. I switched to the cosrx aloe sun cream but I got that same reaction and I‚Äôm currently on the hunt for a new one haha but I recently ordered the ‚ÄúDear, Klairs - Soft Airy UV Essence SPF50+‚Äù which I‚Äôm expecting in the mail soon. I have hope that this sunscreen could work since when I type the ingredients on cosdna.com it tells me all the ingredients are super safe. When I type in the neutrogena sunscreen ingredients on there, it gives me crazy amounts of numbers on the safety scale Go get ‚Äòem!  üòÄ Do you use something like 'solvol' abrasive soap?


What about a 'barrier cream' or other pre/post skincare for hands and arms?


Also...any recommendations on getting transport grime out of clothes? My fellow is a courier, and mostly uses cetaphil wash for the face. Any recommendations on effective (and possibly non-irritant) laundry bleaches or booster? Instead of buying an eye mask, you can keep a spoon in the fridge and take it out in the morning to de-puff and massage your undereyes! I use a cold spoon to massage-in my undereye cream, which is by Hey Honey and has retinol in it. Yeah that‚Äôs really smart. I like buying the travel or samples so I can see how it will work without spending a fortune. I‚Äôve been looking into cleansers by Paula‚Äôs choice lately. Have you tried any of those? it's really okay! and thanks! :) I'm incredibly pale and thought I just had splotchy skin until I got this. I'm also prone to flaky dry skin, but once I got both the morning and nighttime moisturizers it was like night and day. I'm not splotchy or too dry. It was like a Goldilocks moment of realization that I don't have terrible skin, I was just taking terrible care of it. lol. I can say that for my skin, this has been a game changer. I found them on the lotion section of Walmart! I wasn't looking for them at all, but I found them and got every variation they had! They're inexpensive and small enough to be easy to carry all day. I appreciate that suggestion, thank you! Cheap is my favorite :D To be honest, I don't know if I could place it. I'm aggressively motivated in everything I do and I'm pretty good at interviews, but I was fully not expecting to land the job. I got interviewed by a panel and the HR manager said "This is a very competitive job, don't take it personally if you don't get the position." and I said "I've got time. If I don't get it now, I will get it soon." He told me I should be very proud of that interview as I was leaving and I got the call a few days later.

I think it just depends on what railroad you're applying to, but again I'm super thankful to have gotten it. Woah is it that much? I mean it's not like I've given it thought but I would have never imagined it was so competitive. Mostly because it seems so dang hard. I didn't notice it at all until I went on a recent kick of finding all my products with SLS in them when I found out it was in my toothpaste after a long bout of gum inflammation. I'm almost done with the package and figured I'd finish it to not be wasteful, but I'm paying much closer attention now! Good looking out, thank you! :) You sure can! I've really been toying with my routine a lot. I work those hours on the weekdays and then I'm off Saturdays and Sundays. So, I meal prep on Sunday, but that's often just chopping and portioning veggies to cook quickly during my gap. I eat a lot of simple, quick proteins- eggs, cooked chicken/turkey, and shrimp are easy to throw into just about anything. I do OMAD through the week simply because it fits my schedule and helps me get my 8 hours of sleep/not stay up late trying to eat dinner.

I find ways to be active throughout my workday or during my gap. If I'm in a vestibule doing paperwork, I'm squatting/lunging/doing all sorts of goofy stuff that I wouldn't want passengers to see me do. lol.

But mostly I heavily rely on getting good workouts in where I can. Friday nights (Don't have to get up at 4 the next day), Saturday and Sunday afternoons. I spend at least an hour at the gym, lately I've been doing the treadmill on its highest incline at 2.5 speed for as long as I can handle it, focusing on fully stretching my muscles with each step. Then I do a mixture of weighted exercises. I do a similar "focus on my muscle" walk on the stair stepper, then I do whatever weight machines catch my eye. I've lost ~40 pounds in the past 6 months, and I *mindfully* let myself eat cheat treats on weekends. With the nicer weather, I'm also going to be doing more walks, dog park time, generally active fun stuff.

I know that was a lot, I'm sorry! But any other questions, feel free to ask! :) I've been hearing a lot about Cerave, thank you for the suggestion! whats the SPF on that? I'm so fair skinned/ using a AHA and all I've seen in those brands has been 30 and under :/ Nope, not a ton of outside time, generally inside a train or a building! I do wear a hat as part of my uniform (one of the silly looking conductor/nutcracker hats) but it doesn't have a very wide brim.

Thank you for these suggestions! I really appreciate them. I'll get started on my search for a cream with retinol, that seems to be the overall consensus of my feedback from this thread. :) I'm super interested to know how this works out for you, make sure to give us all updates! These are great questions, I will note that I work inside the train with stops at low platforms where I lift a trapdoor/am outside/I also spend much of my time touching money and a pretty dirty environment. I'm not nearly as bad as I'm sure the people who do construction work on or near the rails get. But to answer from my experience:

We use medical grade soap. It's everywhere for us, in every rest area we have.

I use Vaseline intensive care cream as a regular lotion, and you'll rarely find a worker who doesn't have some sort of cream/lotion in their bag or know who carries it that they can use (mine is frequently used on the deadheads).

Despite the fact that our work is dirty, our shirts are white. Bright, vibrant white. To keep them that way- I use a presoak in Shout spot cleaner, then I wash them in standard laundry detergent but with a capful of Clorox 2 for colors and multiple Shout Color Catcher sheets in cold water. (This was suggested to me by one of the oldheads who had the whitest shirts on the railroad, so I've stuck to it like a science and it's worked beautifully for me. But ymmv.) I also carry Shout to go wipes in my bag because you touch a rail even once and now the whole left side of your shirt is black. lol. If they're working with heavier duty grime, my experience might not be helpful! That's a great tip, thank you so much! I haven't, I've never heard of them! That's great :) 
But, I looked into the ingredients in these products and both have alcohol dent. in the ingredient list. Be careful because they could be quite drying. I suggest you look into, in the future, something like CeraVe Lotion, CosRx Ultra Moisturizing Lotion, Pond's Rich Moisturizing Cream (blue lid), Clinique Dramatically Different Lotion or Moisturizer, CeraVe Cream in the Tub, Derma E Hydrating Day or Night Cream, Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Extra Dry formula (this one has no fragrance), I know Lush isn't popular here but I LOVE their Vanishing Cream - it is so soothing and brings this glow to the skin. I was so afraid you were going to say something I didn't have access to, but looks like I'm making a trip to Walmart =D Hi aggressively, I'm Dad! It is. When I got my job they said they did a short window hire and it was around a thousand applicants for 5 positions. It's crazy competitive. You sound like Wonder Woman! I‚Äôve been looking up easy and healthy meal prep recipes and I‚Äôve come a couple of delicious ones! Awesome job on not letting long hours beat you down! ‚ò∫Ô∏è [deleted] Holy Fuck!!! I adore your self discipline so much ‚ô•Ô∏è I work crazy hours compared to the rest of my friends in my field, but it cannot even compare it to your crazy timings! The fact that you still manage to exercise and meal prep regularly is so inspiring! And makes me feel like I need to keep my shitty excuses aside and work on building your level of commitment! 


I too, am trying to lose weight. (30 lbs lost in 4.5 months, 32 more lbs to go.) But I slack so much! I just ordered Krave beauty beet the sun and I have seen great reviews about it and it doubles as a makeup printer. It's spf 50+ PA++++ I'll let you know if it's any good. I get it tomorrow but supposed to be very lightweight. There are a lot of Asian sunscreens to fit every skin type /skin concern, typically most are pa/spf 50++++ (the pluses mean something but I forget what lol). I'm sensitive to mineral sunscreens (which is most western sunscreens) and I was able to find a match on the Asian beauty subreddit (: Update: this new sunscreen gave me the same reaction as every other sunscreen. Will probably go to the doctors office to ask for an allergy test soon bc it feels like everything gives me an allergic reaction haha Interesting! Thank you for the insight! hi! i'm looking at the PM Perfector now and there's no alcohol denat. (https://www.formula1006.com/products/pm-perfector). maybe they've just reformulated..? Yes! The creme brulee is good if you like vanilla, but that rosy lips one is my absolute favorite. Thank you! You've got this too!
Diet is the biggest part and I think taking little steps in the right direction is key. Small changes that feel manageable and with some patience you can hit any goal you set. :) It has been seriously life changing for me, I could not handle the stress of trying to fit three meals into a day where I have so little time. I make so much better choices this way, I'm able to plan ahead and have a solid routine. It's the best! Thank you, I really appreciate it! 

30 pounds lost in that timeframe is also a huge accomplishment! I hope you're proud of yourself for that, because this internet stranger is proud of you! :) I love this sunscreen! It doesn‚Äôt irritate my sensitive skin and isn‚Äôt horribly expensive. It absorbs fairly quickly when you put it on and doesn‚Äôt leave too much of a sheen. Please give us an update on that! I'm super interested. I suppose so. But check out the other lotion. It has alcohol dent. in it. Thank you! But sadly, I have lost a bit of strength along the way too. I joined an exercise class but would let stupid excuses get to me. I keep a close watch on my calorie count, but my diet isn't clean. And instead of using this as an opportunity to learn to cook simple healthy dishes, I just order online or skip meals if I am not too hungry. And there were a lot of binge eating and drinking days too! (I need to work on my binging patterns). And weight loss had kind of stalled in the previous month, when I went back home and binged. 

I think the way to getting somewhere requires a lot more commendation than just the end result! Two days of using it and best sunscreen I've used by far. The nozzle makes it very easy to just get the right amount. My skin is very sensitive upon application of most products but no redness upon application. It sinks into the skin immediately with no greasiness or white cast. It also give my 31 year old skin a nice, natural radiance without being dewy but just looks youthful. Also does wear well under makeup so definitely can see how they consider this a primer too. My friend has oily, dehydrated skin and it works for her skin type as well. The creator said if your skin is very, very oily it may not be for you but suitable for all other skin types. My sister just happened to give me a big bottle of Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel and bottle of Facial Cleanser that she was given but never used. So I'll be giving your suggestion a shot sooner than I thought, thank you! This is great to know! I will be trying it, thank you! :) Please let me know what you think of those! Their on my ‚ÄúTo Try‚Äù list On which shelf does the blood sacrifice go? Acrylic organizers are the best. I'm addicted, I have so many of them lol. The clear hard plastic just looks sooo good. How do you like the murad sunscreen? One day I‚Äôm gonna have enough self love take care of myself like this :) I freaking love your setup Love the salt lamps and amethyst, they add a calming touch  As someone new and passing by, is all of that really necessary? I'm honestly just curious because I only use like 4 or 5 products I‚Äôm just here for the crystals üëç Nice! I started using Luna + Good Genes a few weeks ago. It feels really nice but it‚Äôs probably too soon to tell if it‚Äôs making a difference yet.  This is a beautiful thing.  How do you like the mario badescu vitamin c serum + what do you use it for? I‚Äôve been /really/ wanting to get it but it‚Äôs nearly $50... Off topic question but what do the pink rock lights do. Are they just for aesthetic? I miss my Nip and Fab! They don‚Äôt carry it at Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada anymore, and I have no clue how to get it!
The shrine looks great!!  skincare porn This is a work of art üôåüèª  *(Please note that this is my bedside Skincare Shrine, and therefore does not include any of my cleansers, physical exfoliants, or most of my mask collection. I‚Äôll post those when they‚Äôre equally organized.)*

 I love your shelfie, I also have the lazy and easy but holding it off till i‚Äôm done with some of the products that are currently in my routine, how do you like it so far? Also loving the amethysts :)... lovely aesthetic l. I was literally debating buying Sunday Riley Tidal earlier today but the price tag was making me a little unsure. What are your thoughts on it? Everything I‚Äôve read has me reallllyyy tempted to purchase it!  So pretty! Where did you get the shelving unit? I collect crystals and rocks as a geology major and seeing your lamp reminded me of my SO licking my salt lamp because he didn't believe it was real salt lol

But seriously, this is amazing! Fabulous! Good design equals good routine equals good skin! How do you like the Kate Somerville acid compared to the other acids you use? 
How do you like the elf mask applicator?  Is it a game changer?  I usually apply masks with an eye shadow brush lol I. NEED. THIS. it really caught my eye.  That Nip+Fab glycolic serum is my holy grail. Changed my skin!!! I hate how much I love this.  [deleted] What does the Gudatamma bottle do? Is it a moisturizer? Is that a huge bottle of Breath of Fresh Air or am I just tripping? I‚Äôm OBSESSED with your entire setup, it‚Äôs so organized. Huge props to you!  I bow down to you üëë Loving the amethysts and purple flowers the most. Purple forever. I find this picture so calming üíú [deleted] These are literally organization and aesthetic goals. I've imagined that I would have a setup like this for myself too, this is so awesommeee This is the zen-est thing I have seen all day. Gorgeous!!! This is amazing!! I would love to do something similar üòä you've inspired me! Beautiful üôåüôåüôåüôå chills I love seeing all of my products neatly organized like this--- oddly calming. Inspiration for my bathroom! Crystals and all! Love it! What roller do you have? I want one just for the relax factor but I don‚Äôt want to get one that falls apart or pay too much for something that I could have gotten cheaper! That is the BEST candle currently burning it as I type right now  üî•üî•üî• I LOVE that scented candle from Anthropology! My favorite!! i am living for this aesthetic!!  Wow I just fell in love  How blissful. The crystals and salt rock really tie it altogether so beautifully. Looking at this I feel calmed. I feel like putting a masque on, or the desire to be surrounded by aromas of delicate, soothing lavender or invigorating eucalyptus.  What‚Äôs your favourite product ?  r/OrganizationPorn  Ohhh, I need this... this is gorgeous üò≠ üíï  Where did you get the shelf?  An extra special shoutout to the person who crossposted this to ‚Äúscacirclejerk‚Äù. 

I was feeling really proud of this. The rest of my house is a wreck and impossible to keep up with a 2 y/o underfoot. It took me a week to set this all up, make it look nice, and do the required write up. 

I tried to make it aesthetically pleasing so it would help motivate me to do the steps. I struggle with chronic joint pain and other health issues, as well as C-PTSD, anxiety, and depression.

I know you, specifically, don‚Äôt give a shit and you just want to circlejerk and get your updoots and lolz. I accept that. 

I just thought I‚Äôd speak my mind on my own post and let people here know that ending up as a joke to those people is part of the risk you take by posting in here, apparently. I didn‚Äôt realize.  Where did you get those amethysts?? üòçüòçüòç How‚Äôs that cheeky La Mer? Any good? I wish I could afford something from them. What‚Äôs your must have top fav product?!  I enjoy your Gudetama all-in-one master just peaking behind while picking his nose. Love that stuff. :) AMETHYST YESSSSSSS Does that lavender plant not die in the corner like that? I always wanted a geode but they always cost $30+ üò≠ Where did you get your amethyst from ? Holy shelfie goals, TWO giant amethyst crystals!! This is a vibe, def a shrine üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú® Sorry but i'm just wondering now how expensive this massive geode was?? i have a small one that already did cost 25‚Ç¨ Whats your favorite product on each shelf and why? Oh yeah and the geodes and the salt lamp are a nice touch! I absolutely adore this set up Amazing shelfie but can we talk about those AMETHYST?? Girl I wanna be living like you Also, a mask applicator is a must have. I have a silicone one, it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúI dew care‚Äù by some Korean brand (Tony moly I think?) but I love it and it‚Äôs made masking so much easier!  I love your stones! How beautiful. Like being in a spa or salon... I'm just thinking how long it would take my toddler to  destroy something like this and in what order he'd do it. Sigh... Nothing is safe at my house. Saving this idea though for when he's out of the zoo animal stage.  I have serious skincare shrine envy right now!! You have inspired me to fix my shelf, I have so much stuff and no space to put it!! Mario Badescu is the name of the brand.

I love that you use Nip+Fab too, it‚Äôs one of THE BEST mainstream beauty products.

I am such a beauty lover that I‚Äôm gonna save this post! ÔΩáÔΩèÔΩÅÔΩåÔΩì  Oh.my.god. Obsessed with your amethyst!!!!! Hope that lamp doesn't emit heat!  can this count as r/ladyboners? üòç [removed] Under my pillow, obviously üôÑ  Aaah yesss!!! I also have an acrylic lazy Susan / turntable on top holding those profits, it‚Äôs from the kitchen spice organizer section of atHome, so I don‚Äôt  mess up the whole shelf getting one item haha  also: i find that the basic lipstick acrylic organizers are the perfect size for the average sample size products <3 I feel like mine looks super messy but I think that's because it's the kind with 3 drawers underneath it 

Maybe I should use the top portion only like OP  I love the acrylic organizers too but they get so dusty with makeup powder! How do you keep them looking clean? Damn I'm the exact opposite, I really dislike the look of acrylic organizer like it kinda feel cheap in my opinion. I've got lots of pattern boxes but then I have to remember where I put what and it can get confusing lol It makes my skin look photoshopped in that it fills in fine expression lines and mattifies (but not overly so) - consistency is very dimethicone-y  REALLY love it, and it doubles as a makeup primer which makes it an even more cost effective product (good cuz its pricey) I‚Äôll chime in as someone who has used it extensively! It‚Äôs great for sun protection and leaves zero white cast on me, BUT (and this is a big but) it pills like crazy, especially towards the end of the day. I‚Äôve tried using a little, a lot, a medium amount, etc. I‚Äôve tried with and without foundation. It just likes to pill up. Something to maybe consider!  I‚Äôm a guy and I use this as well. I got  a sample of this and I bought it. It‚Äôs very long lasting and it makes your skin look great too. But it can be a little bit drying so use a good moisturizer underneath. I don‚Äôt use makeup so there‚Äôs no clumping or anything with me. But one pump is good for the face, neck, and d√©colletage. Also pat it on don‚Äôt rub it on.  Aww! Well, one day, maybe the rest of my house will match this little corner of organization, lol <3 we'll both get there!  Thank you so much!! I‚Äôm working hard to make it juuuust right ‚ò∫Ô∏è thank you so much :D Absolutely not necessary hahah. üíú

I‚Äôm a massive skincare product junkie and have been for about 14 years since I worked at Ulta when I was 18. 

I‚Äôve curated this collection over years and most of the high end stuff are gifts or swaps with friends (I send them clothes and they send me products). 

4-5 really good products are truly all you need!  Don't just pass by! Become one of ussssssssss.

On a nightly basis I use (counts on fingers) six products, and that's still a pretty quick routine! I use two or three in the morning depending on what my day looks like. And then of course I alternate in things like serums or exfoliants or whatever as needed. 

But I mean...this is skincareADDICTS so we might all be a little crazy and extra when it comes to our products/shelves/routines. :) This is skincare addiction after all! But I‚Äôm the same as you. Cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen. Every one is different. Thank you!! I‚Äôm a sucker for pretty rocks, haha. The salt lamp was only $5.99 at Menards.  I‚Äôm trying to be more regular, I have a lot of pain in my hands so it‚Äôs kinda difficult to find the energy at the end of the day for a multi step routine üòÖüíú

I hope you see some good results soon! Thank you so much!!! I‚Äôm trying to make it as attractive as possible so I‚Äôll be drawn to the products and actually do the steps üòÖüòò i LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Okay so I like to use it 3x/week (although you can do as frequent as every other day), at night between toner and moisturizer (same step as spot treating blemishes with the UFO). It has dramatically improved the texture on my forehead (little bumps almost completely gone now), and it makes my face insanely soft. I'm somewhat certain that it's helped fade my acne scars, but I'm using a few different products that claim to do that so I can't be 100% sure. If there is a less pricey option with good reviews, maybe that would be a good first step? I'm sorry I don't know of an exact dupe though. Yes, purely aesthetic. Some people claim they purify the air but I don't see how that's possible, I just enjoy having a glowing rock lol <3 Many of the boss babe types think it gives it then magical powers because they are morons.  It's salt.  It will pierce the darkness and that's about it.   Purely I think I found this at CVS, not sure if you have those in Canada? It's my first bottle but I love it too!  Thank you so much <3 I know! Amazon carries it, as does Ebay, but the price is unpalatable. I am looking for a scrub as good as their glycolic one, but am having trouble. you flatterer, you :* this comment made me grin so huge, thank you (also I love your username) <3 Hahahah I love that you use spoons to describe energy levels etc. I'm sorry that you suffer from chronic pain, and definitely am not laughing at that, but my mom has lupus and uses the exact same metaphor! I thought she just made it up, but is it from somewhere? Its the first thing shes ever really said that made the rest of us get it, even if people stare at us like we're crazy when we start talking about how many spoons she has in public.  Wonderful! What is SAHM Thank you! It's the first "essence" I have ever tried (combination essence/toner close enough?), and so far I like how it feels but I'm not sure if I notice any difference, although to be fair I have only had it for about 2 weeks. Thank you for the compliments! Amethyst is my birthstone, I'm a real sucker for geodes :) Not OP but I‚Äôve used it and it‚Äôs nothing special. Any gel/cream moisturizer with hyaluronic acid will work fine (I have tried a bunch and noticed no difference, aside from some awful ones that had fragrance added) Ooomg, do you have access to a physical Sephora location to possibly try some samples first (if you havent already)? I particularly like it at night because it tends to sit on my skin for a little bit longer than the other 2 moisturizers I use, but once it's fully absorbed, my skin feels and looks ...plumper? I think that's the right term? It looks like every cell is quenched, but not in a greasy way, if that makes sense! It also has this beautiful light scent that reminds me of lily of the valley flowers. thank you so much!! IIRC, they were on sale at Menards about a year ago, I don't remember the brand though :\ I added the acrylic organizers, found at Marshall's and HomeGoods (tho i think Dollar Tree has some right now!), and the turntable/lazy susan on the very top shelf I got in the kitchen spice organizing section at the store "atHome" :) LMAOOO what was his face like??? I bet it was priceless XD   


I collect crystals and rocks too! I can't go for a nature walk without coming home with a few bits of quartz or an agate if i'm lucky. Recently taken up succulents as a new hobby and planning to decorate their topsoils with all the rocks for drainage + aesthetic + finally doing something productive w all these damn rocks LOL  


Thank you so much for your lovely compliment! :D Many thanks!! I sure do hope so :)  It might be too soon to say since I've only been using it for about 10 days, but it may very well be the best one. I see and feel an immediate effect and it's even more apparent the next morning. I can't speak highly enough!  I was using a foundation brush before this!! I love it, because it's so easy to clean afterwards and I don't have to stick my grubby fingers into the products lol. I think it was only $5 at Target? Might be cheaper online did you mean the exfolikate? <3 nice!!! i dont know many people who have tried it, may i ask how often you used it and where in your routine? hahaha <3 well i love your username, fwiw  It wasn‚Äôt terrible, $39.99 at HomeGoods! :) 9.99 for the smaller one I think  It‚Äôs a combination toner and essence, and I have never used an essence before so I can‚Äôt say how to compares to others but it‚Äôs a lovely consistency, sort of a gel-lotion almost? Absorbs super quickly . Have only been using it for ~2wks so I can‚Äôt speak to long term effects yet. :) 

Found it for 7.99 at TJ Maxx! It is!! It's 8.4 fl. oz/250mL and the bottle of Simple Micellar Water is also the jumbo, for perspective - 13.5 fl. oz/400mL  


You're super sweet. thank you so much!! I worked super hard on this haha now I just have the get the rest of my house in this kind of shape!! <3 <3  You‚Äôre too kind!! *curtsies* Thank you so much!! Purple power üíúüíúüíú That‚Äôs exactly what I was hoping to achieve!! Thank you very much üòòüíú Stardew Valley :))) Lol, no? I take it you know someone w a similar setup haha  Ahhh you made me so happy with this lovely comment, thank you so much <3 It's very achievable! You can totally do one, and I would really love to see yours! You're so sweet, thank you! I love your username, btw <3 Thank you so much, I would be super interested to see yours as well! All of the organizational components are very inexpensive and easy to find :) omg youre so sweet, thank you very much! <3 Thank you so so much!! I've worked in retail and merchandising so I would like to think I can arrange things so they're all visible and evenly spaced :D it also helps me to remember to use them all when I can see it all at once, instead of having to shuffle things around in the medicine cabinet like I was before. <3 Mine is the ‚ÄúSherrie Matthews acupuncture jade roller‚Äù from the most recent (winter 2018) FabFitFun box! It retails for something ridiculous and I‚Äôm certain there are equally reliable ones for less but this is my first one so I can‚Äôt speak to which, I‚Äôm sorry!! I know there are a L O T on amazon rn though! Sorry I can‚Äôt be more help üíú OMG right??? I was saving it for a while and then I was like wait what the hell am I doing, I better live this life right now!! üíúüíúüíú üíúüòòüíú Ayyyy you‚Äôre the 2nd person who noticed , that‚Äôs awesome üôåüèºüíúüôåüèº Thank you so much!! üòò‚ú® You‚Äôre too kind üòò‚ú® You have a lovely way with words! That vivid imagery is so evocative, I want to keep going and make my whole house cohesive with this now! Thank you so much for your encouraging words! ‚ú®üíú You‚Äôre too kind !! üíú You deserve it too!!! üíúüíú Thank you so much üòòüíúüíú Menards! They were 2 for $15 I commented elsewhere too but I wanna say I‚Äôm sorry they‚Äôre being insensitive, and I know how nice an orderly routine can be with panicky disorders. You keep doin‚Äô you :) I just want to say that it sounds like we‚Äôre a lot alike, in choice of skincare products, aesthetics, and the whole chronic pain hinderance thing. My current project is organizing all of my skincare too. I just have to put one shelf in the wall (which is the hardest part because my dominant arm/hand is partially disabled) then I was going to snap a picture of my hard work and post here. 

I know how hard it is to do projects like this and how proud it makes you of yourself to complete it. It truly is an awesome accomplishment! Normally I take jerks very lightheartedly, I‚Äôve even jerked myself a time or too, but I think they crossed a line with this one, and I‚Äôm really sorry it‚Äôs affected you. It really sucks when someone makes fun of something that you worked so hard on and was so proud of. 

I hope the jerk doesn‚Äôt spoil your spirit (much). Your setup is absolutely stunning and a display to envy. Keep on keepin on, girl; you‚Äôre really cool! 

Ps, if you ever want to gripe about the chronic pain stuff and lack of spoons to someone who right there in that same boat with you, feel free to pm me :) I'm sorry there are so many assholes.
I'm also a SAHM with a chronic pain condition, and I say GINORMOUS KUDOS to you for doing something for yourself.  It looks great, and I hope it helps you remember that you are worth it no matter what the trolls think.  Forgive them for being jealous of you ;) 

I love your shelfie. Bringing a sense of calmness and happiness to your skincare routine is such a wonderful feeling (for me, i like drinking chamomile lavender tea while my serums/masks/whatever sink in) and it sounds like you need that extra pampering. Good for you! That's so gross for someone to repost it as a joke :( I also have CPTSD, anxiety, and depression.  I really loved the layout and the write up. It has a spa like vibe, and you definitely deserve to feel proud of it especially if it brings you joy. You did a great job, and your post inspired me to make my skincare space more aesthetically pleasing!! You got me researching what salt lamp is best on Amazon, looking up crystal meanings. Ty for posting this  Sending love!!! The haters are boomeranging all those negative acts back on themselves. Put a hand on that amethyst and breathe deep because you are crushing it and inspiring others!!!  From the store HomeGoods! The small one was 9.99 and the big one was 39.99! It‚Äôs very nice, makes the undereye supple and has a very subtle glimmer to it! It was a gift from a very good friend, I‚Äôm blessed to know her üíú The Simple Micellar Water was a total game changer for me. If I didn‚Äôt have that, I couldn‚Äôt do any of the rest of those steps if I had to stand over the sink and do a proper cleanse each time! I can‚Äôt be without it. Definitely the most important one! Thank you!! He's a total cutie, I couldn't pass him up <3 I'm really enjoying it so far too! My first "essence" product  AYYY üôåüèºüíúüôåüèº pretty rocks are life! ‚ú® it's a fake!! would definitely be suffering from lack of light, good eye :) trying my hand at succulents currently, hoping to move up to flowers when i am more confident <3 If you can find one in a shop so you don‚Äôt have to pay shipping , I find that home decor shops have better prices on them than, say, a shop that specializes in rocks and geodes (weirdly enough). The big one is about 12‚Äù tall and it was 39.99 at home goods, the smaller one up top was 9.99 HomeGoods! Small one was 9.99, large was 39.99 :) You‚Äôre so sweet, thank you!! I‚Äôm gonna keep going with all this amazing encouragement from you lovely people üíúüòòüíú No problem, it‚Äôs from the store HomeGoods and it was $39.99USD :) Thank you so so much!! It took only a few minutes to actually put it all together but then I rearranged it all endlessly until it was balanced üòÖüíúüíú Thank you so much!!! I got the geodes at HomeGoods, the smaller one was 9.99 and the big one was only 39.99! You can be living like me ! üòòüíú‚ú® I could agree more! Omg I have a few of their peel-off masks (disco kitten and space kitten, I wanna say?), do you have any experience w their products? üíúüíú Thank you very much!!

They‚Äôre surprisingly affordable - small amythest geode was 9.99 and the big on was 39.99 from HomeGoods, and the salt lamp was 5.99 from Menards! üíú I have an almost-2-year old boy, how old is your lil monster? üòÖ this is on my bedside table and he can‚Äôt get to it unless he crawls over my body while I‚Äôm in there, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be able to have this, either! The struggle is real üôèüíúüòò

Thank you for the lovely compliments!!  Aww you‚Äôre very kind üíú 
Tackle it this weekend if you‚Äôre able to! This is on my bedside table, so I can use it all before/after sleeping and not need to be in the bathroom for these steps. 

Get a cheapie little barebones shelf and a couple acrylic organizers + maybe a lazy Susan for the top like I did if you want and you‚Äôre set! Probably like $30 total :) Thank you so much!!! I got it from HomeGoods :) Almost none at all, but I still only have it on for a few minutes at a time anyway :) I‚Äôm a sucker for string lights too haha üíú
Good looking out! I‚Äôm honored!! üòÇüòò Hi there,

I'd like to remind you of our Rule 1: Be kind and respectful.

We'd like our sub to be a friendly and welcoming place. That‚Äôs why I want to ask you to refrain from rude or disrespectful comments here. This encompasses rudeness, trolling, and, in general, being disrespectful. Even if you feel strongly about something, please stay polite. Also please keep in mind that Shelfies are regulated to 'Casual Friday' only. So if you don't like these types of posts, you can use the filter in the sidebar on Fridays.

Thank you! 

For more information, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_1._be_kind_and_respectful.).  ...what? I did the required write up and am answering product questions in comments, what exactly are you complaining about? How often do you take everything off to clean? What is the best method? I feel like my clear plastic stuff gets so gross so fast üò≠ There's this spray for leather/furniture that makes dust slide off if you're interested but usually I don't have any problems and I have a pretty dusty house. I throw mine in the dishwasher from time to time.  Does it have a white cast? What do you mean by ‚Äòpills‚Äô?  Okay this makes more sense haha. I'm a nail polish/manicure junkie so i think i understand a bit better. Thats pretty cool that you can do swaps with people, I've never tried that before I may stick around to see what its all about!

I generally try to use mostly natural products and I make a lot of my own. I'm not some kind of crazy ogranic gluten hippie vegan type of person though lol I usually try to stick with goats milk soap, cocoa butter, sugar scrubs, witch hazel, coconut oil, oats, avocado, honey, etc.

What are the purpose of the 6 products you use at night? Random, but do you feel a difference with the crystal? Really contemplating getting one, but I've only seen semi-expensive ones around here... Nah I don‚Äôt need a dupe! I just need to hear some good things about it from others first. Thanks! Hi there! I‚Äôm very interested in products to help get rid of scars! Mostly from some hormonal inflammation (2-3 spots) and a couple from plucking hairs ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What have you been successful with using? I am 23 with a fair complexion that is combination sensitive skin. I‚Äôd also love dupes of the products if they are too expensive üôà The same people who think essential oils cure cancer üôÑüòÖüòí

(Some of those fuckers felt bold enough to tell my dying father at the end of his battle against colon cancer that HE SHOULD TRY OILS AND A RAW VEGAN DIET, when the man had about 1-2weeks left. I hope they all choke on their oils.) I snorted so hard at this comment. never heard about boss babe types tho [this](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) is the origin of Spoon Theory, and is a great reference to show others if you want to explain it to them too :) <3 Stay-At-Home-Mom :)

Thank you kindly!! üòò Totally valid, I don't have a ton of experience with the more hydrating products so I don't know the exact dupes but I am sure there are better products at more reasonable price points.  Thanks for the reply! My day cream has been cerave which does have hyaluronic acid in it. And I bought a tub of the neutrogena hydro boost water gel but still haven‚Äôt actually tried that one. And I use a hyaluronic acid serum at night from The Ordinary, so I def have that ingredient covered at the moment  Yah I literally work a few blocks away from a Sephora lol. Def gonna have to go in and try a sample of it! My skin is dry and sensitive so I‚Äôm always looking for whatever products are gonna quench it the most. And I totallyyy wouldn‚Äôt mind looking plumper too lol  He just nodded and said "yep, that's salt" Is it a glycolic acid? Has it helped reduce scarring? Awesome!  Thanks so much!  I‚Äôm trying out the DE retional right now and interested in trying this out next.  That sounds so great thank you!  I bet it‚Äôll waste less product than the bristles soaking it up lol Yes!!! I use it every night! I makeup remove, cleanse, toner, essence, eye cream THEN use the Nip+Fab. I follow that with moisturizer and face oil. :-) Hope it works for you as well as it has for me! Thanks! Oh wow I really need to pick up that XL breath of fresh air, that stuff is my holy grail! Thanks so much for letting me know!

And absolutely, I can tell you worked really hard on it. My shelfie is currently looking.... a bit messy to say the least. We all know how tough it is to get all these products not only organized but pretty to look at! ‚ù§Ô∏è  hahah i just googled it, she's adorable, i'll take it XD Thank you! that‚Äôs so sweet!‚Äô ‚ô•Ô∏è Ahh!! Definitely :)) I live right next to a Home Goods so I'll be going this weekend. I'll send you a pic! It'll take me some time üòÖ I now also really want some amethyst too xD You‚Äôre welcome! Your post engendered all those feelings, heightening the imagination and senses all on their own, just by looking at it. 

It transported me. It inspired me. It stilled me into quietness. 

Definitely keep going! I wish you more happiness, contentment, and brilliant sparks of joy as you make the rest of your house a sanctuary for serenity as well.  I only discovered it yesterday after organising all my drawers and shelves haha That salt lamp... üòç How much did you pay for it? you're so kind, thank you very much. I'm kindof being a baby, haha, but it's been a rough day, so I extra-appreciate your empathy and support <3  You're so nice, thank you, seriously. I'm being a Sensitive Snowflake today, I suppose, but you're right, I'll try and focus on the fact that I accomplished this goal for myself. It was the first thing I have written on my list of "Monthly Goals" in my planner.

Solidarity in the SAHM with pain struggle; I hope you're finding relief. <3 your support is very much appreciated, thank you <3 i'm more of a coffee fiend, myself, but a choice beverage and a good read are absolutely essential to the pampering experience :D Cheers! i thought it was gross, too. thank you for your empathy! i'm sorry to hear that you are a fellow survivor/warrior. i'm binge-watching 'tidying up' with Marie Kondo right now, and sparking joy is PRECISELY what i was trying to achieve!! thank you so much for your lovely compliments, it makes me feel a lot better to know that there is someone out there who really gets how hard this was to do. I would sincerely LOVE to see your space, when/if you feel like posting it <3 thank you for this response <3 thank you for being so nice to me, I was feeling a little salty, haha. I am uplifted by the response from this lovely community, now, and cannot express my gratitude enough <3 <3 I tend to buy my gems whenever a fair is in town. But thanks! Those amethysts look really nice. Oh, I thought it was in a bathroom and I was thinking that would never ever work for me! Mine is 16 months and worse than a cat. Nothing is safe ever since he learned to pull up an object and stand on top of it to reach something. All that's saving me is that he hasn't figured out doorknobs yet üòÅ I‚Äôm Scottish and have no idea what a lazy Susan is?!ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I also love organisers for make up & beauty products!

My daughter has a full length mirror that is also a cupboard too with proper makeup type lights (what‚Äôs their real name?) around mirror and indents+shelves inside for products, it also has hooks at either side of outer door for hairdryers, Tongs, etc.  

I bought her this Standing Beauty Organiser, or whatever it was called, on Amazon, and it‚Äôs amazing and I may just get one for myself, it comes in 4 colours too, light baby pink, white, grey & black.

Can I ask what the brand Mario something is like? It‚Äôs on your shelf.  I have just seen his products on Beauty Bay & that product isn‚Äôt in any shops over here, I think it originated from New York, I would love to hear some feedback on his products before I buy please?

Do you genuinely use most of these products? or are some for show?!ü§©

You have definitely inspired me and I just said to my ex partner (we‚Äôre great pals) that I‚Äôm gonna change my room about tonight and then arrange my stuff, I already have inbuilt shelves in my room so at least I have something to start with.üòäüòä My favorite amethyst came from home good too!!!! Of course it‚Äôs 1/3 that size!!! I like to have them around the house. They‚Äôre just soothing and gorgeous!  Same I have one but I don't use it anymore for this reason :( What's the spray called? No, it‚Äôs completely clear!! I got a sample and adored it, but haven‚Äôt been wanting to buy a full size just yet because of the price.  I think that's when it like balls up and leaves little clumps. It‚Äôll start to ball up and fall off. When you touch your face you can feel tiny little clumps of product. Sort of similar to when a sweater starts to ball up in the armpits from the friction of the fabric rubbing together. Hope that makes sense! First I use a cleanser, then a beauty water to remove the makeup that gets left under my eyes, a hyaluronic acid to help retain the moisture from my other products, then a moisturizer, an oil, and an eye cream! With the salt lamp crystal? Honestly, no, I wish I could say otherwise, hah. It adds a calming vibe to the ambiance of the room, and I personally really dig the look of the unpolished salt crystal, but if your local ones are expensive, try Amazon? A friend sent me one that was around $12 I think and it's lovely :) Salt lamps are pseudoscience. They are literally a source of light and an ornament, don‚Äôt expect anything beyond that.  Not OP and I haven‚Äôt noticed any difference either. But the light is warm and soothing and I found mine for $10 at Homegoods, I think.  Don‚Äôt fall for this pseudoscience. They cost a lot of money because they‚Äôre ripoffs. Second Amazon, also try Marshall's, Ross, Home Goods, etc. They're usually littered with them, and those kinds of stores might have them in interesting shapes. 

Not OP, but the warm light is great for winding down away from screens. I think of it like a houseplant, but it puts out salt ions instead of oxygen. The difference one of them makes by itself is probably minimal or a placebo, but even just enjoying it aesthetically is enough.  Oh, well \*that\* I can definitely provide, I love nothing more than  gushing over HG products, lol. I'm new to this sub and y'all are so freakin nice <3 <3 <3  Check out r/AntiMLM for more fine examples of people peddling snake oil cures Thank you for this, and thank you for practicing self care! :) Check out the Tatcha Indigo face cream too, I've panned a Tidal and I really like it, it wears well with everything I use and sinks in well. But if you are sensitive, it is supposed to help with dark spots, so it may be a little too much? I'd def get samples of both. Classic üòÇ Here's the Key Ingredients:

* 10% Triple Acid Blend (Glycolic, Malic and Lactic Acids): Exfoliate dead skin cells, smooth away surface dullness, and hydrate for a brighter, more even-looking complexion.
* Phytic Acid with Pumpkin, Papaya, and Pineapple Enzymes: Help enhance skin exfoliation for more glowing skin.
* Peptides, Honey, and Tea Extract: Help soothe and offset irritation.  


I'm using a few different products to reduce scarring so it's a little too soon for me to tell, to be totally honest. I'll try to update in another 2 weeks with more info though! I notice an immediate 'glow' and my pores look less noticeable, and it seems to be doing some sort of micro-magic on my fine lines?? No problem :) Ooh that's a point I didn't even think of, even better :o What else do you use in terms of products üòç I‚Äôm on the hunt for a routine like yours. I have combo oily sensitive skin so finding products that won‚Äôt irritate me is a frustrating task...Has the Nip + Fab helped with any PIH scarring?  I‚Äôm gonna check it out now, thanks for the idea!! üíú $5.99! Menards :) Everyone has those days. I lash out too when I don't exactly mean it either, then regret what I said afterwards Oh that sounds much more ethical, I‚Äôll have to try that! Thank you for the idea and the compliment  [deleted] what is the benefit of using oil after a moisturizer and an eye cream? I have a vitamin C serum, does that take the place of an oil or moisturizer? Or where does that come in.  I read somewhere that its helpful If I may ask, because I‚Äôm on the hunt for a similar routine: what products do you use? Specifically the HA Serum and moisturizer:) I have combination sensitive skin that gets dehydrated and dull ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Recommendations (affordable, non toxic and no fragrance) would be so helpful too if yours aren‚Äôt up my skin types alley!  There are a lot of inexpensive ones now too! I got mine at Menards and it was only $5.99 a couple weeks ago - amazon had them around $10-$12 for his size :)

Don‚Äôt buy the overpriced ones! They‚Äôre just pretty lamps is all :) I‚Äôm just noticing this comment! I‚Äôve never heard of Tatcha Indigo, but I love learning of new products lol. Definitelyyy going to try and sample that one too, thanks for the recommendation!  Is it irritating at all? I‚Äôve been looking at it  This is great info to have, thank you!  That would be a nice treat! I have a handful of sunscreens I need to work through before I want to buy anything else, but I work an office job in the Pacific Northwest, so I don‚Äôt have much need to use any right now lol Not OP but I have very dry skin, and using an oil after my moisturizer really helps make my skin soft and bouncy. It may not be something that everyone needs but it makes a major difference for me. I don't have one in my routine, but I took a gander at my friend Dr. Google to see where a Vitamin C Serum might fit in here. It's good for helping fill in fine lines as well as keeping you from getting new ones. However I don't think that it's enough on its own. Maybe someone more experienced could weigh in, or you could post it to the main sub? Hmm, I generally like fragrance, but my hyaluronic acid product is the Kale and Green Tea Superfood Whip from Youth to the People and I don't think it has a scent! All of my moisturizers are pretty heavily scented but I can really recommend everything YttP for sensitive skin! (I don't know if you would consider them affordable, but you can get a kit of their products to try them out for $48.  My pleasure!! I was soooo hype when they started pushing the ads for it all over social media because it really is like 9 products rolled into one üíú Ah I see okay. I have combination skin so I try to only use oils when needed, thanks for explaining this to me Oh I'm sorry I must have responded to the wrong post.  I think I meant to reply to someone who was talking about using a Vitamin C serum but thank you anyway for consulting Dr. Google lol, that does help. :) Thank you for your reply!‚ò∫Ô∏è I have heard that is a good product! Despite the fragrance, I wouldn‚Äôt mind hearing about your HG moisturizer(s) - sounds weird but I love smelling products in the store üòÇ I‚Äôm getting low on good genes (this is my second jumbo bottle) and I‚Äôm looking to replace it with either the new SR A+ retinol or the Kate Somerville. I‚Äôve loved good genes but I feel like the benefits have sort of plateaued over the year. I got samples of the SR A+ from allure this month, so I‚Äôll be trying that first!  LOL, no worries, the other day I texted the wrong person not once, twice, no THREE times.  Oh well! Ultimate HG is Tatcha The Water Cream, but it's SO EXPENSIVE. When it's dry outside I alternate it with the lavender Laneige Sleeping Mask. I also use the Mamonde Rose Oil-to-Foam cleanser to wash my face and the Rose Hydrating Beauty Water.

For a super gentle exfoliant I also use Tatcha's The Deep Cleanse if I feel like my skin is looking dull. And I cannot recommend putting an oil into your routine enough! Squalene oil is lovely and easy to use, and can be bought for a reasonable price.  I‚Äôve heard that Squalane oil is amazing! Been looking for products with it in it, and I‚Äôve seen that La Roche Posay, First Aid Beauty and a few other products have plenty üòá I just use 100% squalene oil from Biossance. My daughter is super into the Herbivore Lapis facial oil. She calls it "the peppermint smurf one" when I offer her an oil.  üòÇüòÇ That‚Äôs the best name ever, lmao! **Hi everyone!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* fellow engineering student with lots of tears to hide! i very much  appreciate this post haha I‚Äôm a simp for the Fresh Vitamin Nectar Mask üòÇ When I did engineering, I couldn‚Äôt afford all these.. but I used to buy a lot of sheet masks from Amazon to hide my bloated sleepless face üòÅ As a practicing engineer, I‚Äôd say it applies after graduation. But having a job means having money for products, which one needs for the eye wrinkles from said job ü§î oh so you like that FRAGRANT fragrance. I see you. I respect you. I cant relate to you, or get anywhere near you, but I respect you. How do you students afford all this skincare? I can‚Äôt afford most of these brands **Clay masks:** 

\- The body shop tea tree - love it on any pimples and calm & soothing  

\- Freeman beauty charcoal mask - great for oily T-zone and large pores 

 \- Keihl‚Äôs Turmeric and Cranberry (not in pic as a I recently finished it XD) - uhhhhmazing for brightening and exfoliating 

**Gel masks:**

 \- keihl‚Äôs calendula and aloe - soothing and hydrating. Skin looks refreshed!  

\- Fresh Vitamin nectar - brightening and great for getting rid of any dark spots! It has nice gel texture with real citrus  

**Sleeping masks:** 

 \- laneige water sleeping mask - hydrates skin and you wake up to soft and supple skin.  

\- YTTP Superberry dream mask - wake up to glowy and hydrated skin! [removed] Oooohh what kind of engineering are you studying? Not to be an asshole but there‚Äôs literally nothing in that Kiehls mask that is gonna actually do anything for your skin. It‚Äôs basically overpriced glycerin with a hint of calendula at the bottom of the ingredients list. Kiehls is a garbage company and I want to save you guys some money by putting that out there. (It‚Äôs also owned by L‚ÄôOr√©al) Why tears? How can you even afford it ??? All of that stuff is so tiny for how expensive it is As a software engineer, I want to tell you that it gets better. Crying in a Tesla during lunch is a lot nicer than your college apartment üòù. 

srs: I thought I was in the cj sub when I saw your post. Do you think these masks would also hide law student tears? Asking for a friend. Ooohh what's the tea tree body shop one like ? Which is your favorite?! That Fresh mask is to die for! I literally want it all over my body. I feel like the hydrate and glow is just a moisturizer.... it‚Äôs off and my skins not hydrated in the morning I have that YTTP Superberry mask and I use like the THINNEST layer possible and I still feel like my pillow is suctioned to my face all night long. It just sits on top of my skin forever You will still need it when you land that first job. It is intimidating as hell. There will be tears on your way home sometimes. Keep treating yourself to these lovely products. It helps me when I have to tell myself that I just need these few years of experience then I can move on. FYI a thick layer of Cereve under the eyes works wonders too! Hang in there! The paychecks, stability, and benefits down the road are well worth the brutal college tears/years. Ooh question! What is yall‚Äôs opinion on Kiehl‚Äôs? I‚Äôve been doing skincare for a year now, and exclusively used Kiehl‚Äôs stuff. I started to branch out a bit bc I felt that Kiehl‚Äôs is too expensive, considering that their products seem to have active ingredients less often than other companies such as Cerave and Murad do. So far it‚Äôs going well, I was just curious if I‚Äôm being misinformed or if anyone else had the same experience. Back in the early 2000s I wasn‚Äôt as wise as you. I just cried, drank copious amounts of coffee and wished for the best. You‚Äôve got this! Kiehl‚Äôs Calendula Mask is great for when I tattoo myself and my skin is kinda irritated, it really calms and soothes it I swear by youth to the people tbh How do you like the fresh vitamin nectar mask?

Youth to the people Hydrate + glow mask? Relatable, lol. Starting engineering classes this fall lol, I‚Äôll take note of this lol it's so worth it. college is so much harder than the real world jobs same [removed] What brush are you using to apply your masks? Always nice to see what works for others!üòéüëç Engineer here. I like to use the YTTP superberry mask to hide my tear stains. Another engineering student here to share your sympathy lol! Your mask collection is beautiful and relatable rofl - keep going! \*takes furious notes as a computer science student\* As s former engineering student..I would suggest using instant coffee mask in the undereye area to depuff eyes after they are swollen shut due to heavy downpour  last night. Engineer here, the money helps to wipe away the tears. Masks are still good tho. I took my (all male except me) senior design group to get mani/pedis after finals and they wished they hadn‚Äôt made fun of my sheet mask habit. I'm trying to figure out if you guys are talking about crying tears or like ripped up skin tears. It's not that bad. Just four years and if you do the work you'll do fine. Other professions have to get masters/phd's to make the money we make. Same here! I'm so glad I'm graduating in the fall cuz I've heard there are a lot less tears in the workplace lol. Lol I think it's underestimated how many tears we cry. especially with being forced into online classes. Oh you want me to do this fluids lab completely online now? Lemme get my bulk stock of Kleenex boxes üò≠ engineer here. all of it are worth it! I used to work for fresh and I love their products so gd much. I used the Vitamin Nectar Mask when my roommate wasn‚Äôt home. She can back and said, ‚Äúomg you look GLOWING. Did you do a face mask??‚Äù I just got a sample of it with my fresh soy cleanser. Stoked to try it now!! Saaammmeeee. That shit is üí•‚ùáÔ∏è‚ú®üåüüéá instantly makes me look better. Haha I feel that. Currently doing engineering and looked up the prices for the Fresh Vitamin C Face Mask after seeing people in the replies raving about it and saw the $80 and noped the hell of the website. Any good cheap sheet mask recommendations?? LOOL good to know for near future for the engineers at the field, finding the HG spf for your skin is compulsory If it smells like self care............ my skin probably hates it Hyram would have a heart attack The Khiels Calendula mask is my holy grail. 10/10. I use it once a week and love the hydration it gives me but my face doesn't feel like there is a film on it. That Freeman mask is in Dollar Tree now if you want a score. I just bought it, and others in that line. I am yet to try it since I'm a diehard lover of their blue Anti-Stress mask. Is the charcoal one super drying? How often do you use each of these? There are just so many. I‚Äôve always been afraid of masking and exfoliating (chemically) too much. ü§îü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Does the body shop mask work for cystic acne? How often do you use them? Do you combine any of them? Do you use the Laneige water mask in place of moisturizer? I just bought it and the fragrance was a bit stronger than anticipated. How do you incorporate the sleeping masks into your routine? biomedical engineering student here, about to buy all of these right now. Engineering students are like the vegans of the uni majors. You‚Äôll know what they study within 5 mins of meeting them lol Computer Engineering üôåüèª Bc they are an engineering student Not an appropriate question lol I hope so :‚Äô( [deleted] please be aware it can inflame your skin badly! I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad, please please patch test before hand It‚Äôs great!! Especially when I breakout
Very calm and soothing Ahhhh that‚Äôs a hard one... but I‚Äôll have to go with fresh Vitamin nectar! RIGHT?! SAAAAME LOOOL thanks for the tipsss *cries* Haha! Yupppp almost there Yah Kiehl‚Äôs is expensive and sometimes there are many other (and better) alternatives! Just find what works the best for you I agree with you assessment- they are expensive and not effective (for me!) Kiehls is owned by L‚ÄôOr√©al and I‚Äôve noticed a decline in their products over the years I really like their cucumber cleanser. I‚Äôve tried a lot of different cleaners but my skin really likes that one. LOL thanks!! Love them both!! Haha good luck! Wow much english I started using a flat makeup brush that I wasn‚Äôt using as much since I didn‚Äôt have one for masks. It works great but I was just applying them with my fingers befoee Saaame Haha! Yaaay thanksss LOOL!! Yaaas I need to get into eye masks! Is there a specific coffee one? Or homemade? You're absolutely right! It is so, so much better on the other side! Keep it up. It's definitely worth the tears. I was gonna say, 70k new grad median salary would help me wipe away the tears haha Didnt know engineers are the ‚Äùwell off‚Äù people in other countries, now I‚Äôm even sadder  :‚Äô) Yeah I‚Äôm not sure, either. Tears over exam difficulty? [deleted] Really depends on the workplace. i had to finish my senior design project online and was NOT pleased The color and texture makes me giggle. YAAAAAASSSS!! Haha I was an international student with a huge debt so I would think twice even for a $20 product. [These masks ](https://www.amazon.com/Dermal-Korea-Collagen-Essence-Facial/dp/B00BAM7F8C/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=sheet+masks&qid=1595556937&sprefix=shee&sr=8-3) are very hydrating and refreshing, this is exactly what I needed after long sleepless nights spent doing project ! Peter Thomas Roth has a great cucumber mask, I personally use the Laser Gel from Elta Md as a gel mask, please please PLEASE stop using Kiehls- it‚Äôs very overpriced for little to no beneficial ingredients. Do you know anything else like it for sensitive skin? I tried this mask and it felt like it was burning my face unfortunately :( I don‚Äôt find the charcoal one drying at all. I use it on my oily t-zone for about 15-20 mins. 
I have tried the glam glow charcoal one and didn‚Äôt like it as much as the freeman one (especially for the price!!) I use the sleeping masks (either or) twice a week. 
Clay and gel mask once a week. Sometimes I do combine them- I like to put charcoal on t-zone and gel all over. Or sometimes use the tea tree one as a spot treatment on a breakout Yah! Seems to work for me I use the sleeping masks (either or) twice a week. 
Clay and gel mask once a week. Sometimes I do combine them- I like to put charcoal on t-zone and gel all over. Or sometimes use the tea tree one as a spot treatment on a breakout I do put on a very thin layer of moisturizer (neutrogena hydro boost) and then a thin layer of the mask. I personally have been using it as my sole moisturizer during the summer (put on a pretty healthy layer of it at night). Its not quite moisturizing enough for me in the winter, so I'll either use a light layer with a heavier moisturizer on my drier areas, or skip this altogether. You know the Laneige water mask is to wear overnight, right? I put them on as the last step of my skincare (twice a week) :3 skincare shopping is ultimate happiness Don't forget the med students...btw my advice as a med student...:p This and maybe business majors. ‚ÄúI have a startup idea, I‚Äôll do the business side of things‚Äù Lmao and if they have their PhD I‚Äôll ask ‚Äúso how long does it take to get your bachelors‚Äù gets em every time You know us so well :‚Äô) Nah you're thinking of nursing students. why so? :) niceee!! i'm just starting chemical engineering Ayyy Electrical Engineering student here. I understand your pain It probably came off as rude I'm sorry. I'm just shocked I would love to be able to afford fresh lol I‚Äôm sure equally miserable in different ways. May your fridge always be stocked with red bull, your index cards colour coded, and your highlighters full of ink. definitely the bar Yup! Please see what works for your skin!! Great thanks ! I've tried the Kiehls and it was really nice. I haven't tried the others tho. Which is your favorite? Just a pinch of instant coffee & a few drops of cold water. If you're in the right profession.  That number gets bumped up by petroleum engineers, and unemployed students don't factor into it.  Most students will see somewhere closer to $55-60k (which is still a lot, don't get me wrong) I mean, we make less than doctors or most lawyers, but for a 4 year degree it would be hard to make significantly more. Real glutton for punishment, huh? Ofc! But you could say the same thing about different engineering schools. Came back to this thread to say that my skin looked AMAZING, so soft and smooth post mask. Will be purchasing a full size asap Thanks. Also just wondering what your skin type is, mine is acne prone and oily. I‚Äôm always on edge when trying new products. How do you use the Elta MD mask? It says online it's for after laser treatments. 

I unfortunately can't use the PTR mask. It has ingredients in it that I'm allergic to. Is Kiehls bad? I've been using it for years and love this line. They have a toner too that's really gentle. I had that reaction to the calendula mask too. Try the Kiehl's avocado mask, it's soothing and very hydrating, and doesn't cause any burning or redness for me. In my experience, you can also leave it on as long as you like, which is great for lazy mask days. So unlike the poster below, I cannot use the Fresh mask. I have very sensitive skin but I cannot handle heavy moisturizers or masks, even though my skin is dry. It's like way to heavy for whatever reason. 

So the other mask I really like is the Dr. Jardt Ceramidin mask. Its really hydrating but not heavy. I also like the Dr. Jardt Ceramidin Liquid if I want to layer it on and make my face really dewy. It's a great product. I do not have a damaged moisture barrier which is who the range is meant for. It's just a really great line. I have sensitive skin too, but these worked for me! I used to use the fresh rose mask and love it too. Try doing a patch test with it! Meaning? Sorry I don't understand. I leave it on like a moisturizer currently I just finished chemical engineering! Be prepared to hide your tears ... but you can AND will get through it! Civil gang Don‚Äôt work in a plant lol but you will be able to get a job anywhere basically So, what is the fugacity of your tears? I like this reunion! I'm an electronic engineer (but I don't know if there's really a difference between the two...) I would have to go with the vitamin nectar one (but I do loveee them all :‚Äô) Ouuu thanks a lot! Trying this tomorrow!! Accounting for cost of living engineers here make around 35k, and usually we'll go to places like the UK for college as international students with international tuisyen fees, which are expensive af Very true!! It‚Äôs fine, I just cry all the time. Mine is dry sensitive but I have no acne issues. I found these masks to be gentle for me :) It‚Äôs an amazing hylauronic mask with papaya enzymes- the ingredient list is nice and short and it‚Äôs fragrance free Or skip Kiehls and try a mask from Glossier if you have sensitive/dry skin, theirs are way gentler than Kiehls I believe most people do their normal night time skincare routine (cleanse, toners, actives, moisturizer, oil, etc), and then use a thin layer of this on top of everything else. Moisturizer + water mask, then go sleep. Don‚Äôt you feel like your face is super wet wearing it during the day? oh boy! thank you i'm going to need all the luck i can get :) Plants are awful! ahh thats good insight thank you! I really didn't need this flashback to thermo. Thanks Thank you! I should have clarified I JUST got it and used it maybe 2-3x as a moisturizer only at night, didn't feel greasy at all [deleted] thank you!! much appreciated I'm really digging that picture on the right! College art student with a skincare obsession as you can see. This routine has made wonders on my skin.

**Skin Type & Concerns:**  
* Combination (used to be extremely oily but my current routine has me more on the normal side).  
* Random itchy whitehead breakouts that I self-diagnosed as fungal acne. Might be bullshit but it got a million times better since I (mostly by accident) switched to a fungal-sage routine. It still happens sometimes when I use certain makeup or a new product.
* Dryness on some areas, super acne-prone, clogged skin, PIH and PIE, CC‚Äôs and texture. A random HUGE cystic pimple on either of my cheeks once every few months. 

**Daily AM Routine:**  
+ Rinse face with water  
+ Melano CC on my cheeks and chin - Used it on my whole face about 4 times a week and saw little results, but been using it daily more as a spot treatment and been getting better results. Not sure if I will repurchase but I do like that it is a stable formula.
+ Hada Labo Premium - this is my absolute HG and if I had to drop every other product and use only one then this would be it. Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.  This is the first product I incorporated of this routine and I believe it‚Äôs made my skin stop producing so much damn oil. My HA baby.
+ Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - this is a very extra unimportant step, but doesn‚Äôt cause any harm, calms my skin and lasts FOREVER.  
+ Sebamed Clear Face Gel - my second HG. I have an arsenal of moisturizers on top of my closet that all broke me out. This is lightweight, does not break me out or make me feel greasy/heavy.  
+ Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel - My sebamed gel is really small and somewhat costly for my budget so I just mix it with this to make it last longer.  
+ TO Squalane Oil - I‚Äôm all about being hydrated and moisturizer and dewy, being dry or matte stresses me out so I kinda bathe in this. Love it.  
+ Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence - this is the first and only sunscreen i‚Äôve used for my face, no complaints. No cast at all, applies smoothly and let‚Äôs me be dewy. 


**Daily PM routine**  
+ Ponds Cold Cream (when wearing makeup) - Does it‚Äôs job and doesn‚Äôt break me out, can‚Äôt ask for more.  
+ Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser - I previously used the La Roche-Posay foaming cleanser and didn‚Äôt realize how tight and weird it made my skin feel until I switched to this. Lives up to the gentle name, not stripping but cleanses well.  
+ Hada Labo Premium  
+ Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence  
+ TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - Love this product, but the texture and applying it is a PAIN, most annoying product in my routine, but oh do I love it. I mix it with the Snail Mucin to minimize pilling and because for some reason it feels super watery when i apply it on my face on its own and it annoys me. ITS SO ANNOYING. However, it helps tremendously with my clogged pores and oil production and texture. I haven‚Äôt used it in a few days bc I have forgotten and my skin has definitely noticed.
+ Sebamed Clear Face Gel + Benton Aloe Propolis Gel
+ TO Squalane Oil


**Mon/Wed/Fri - PM**
* TO Lactic Acid 5% - I use this after washing my face, and wait 20mins before the rest of my routine. This really just does it‚Äôs job, helps with texture and acne and everything. Not sure if I love it. I will switch to the 10% version once this runs out to see if it‚Äôs better.

**Tue/Thu/Sat - PM**  
* TO Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% - I use it after the Hada Labo but before the Snail Mucin. My new holy grail. Oh my god. In just a week this annoying silicony thing helped my PIH, my CC‚Äôs are almost gone, haven‚Äôt broken out since I started using it, everything is beautiful. 

**Once a week / as needed:**  
* TO BHA AHA 30% Peeling Solution (not pictured) - Love this thing. I use it sunday nights for 10mins. 
* De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment - I use this when I have those ‚Äúfungal‚Äù flare ups or when my skin is annoying me. Works soooo well. 
* Skinfood Watermelon Soothing Mask - it‚Äôs nothing special. I mostly use it when I wanna be fancy, but it is hydrating and soothing. Feels nice and doesn‚Äôt break me out, can‚Äôt ask for more.
* Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion - I use it on that once HUGE cystic pimple I get every now and then. It definitely works, but if I start using it as soon as i feel the pimple coming. 
* Mario Badescu Drying Lotion. No idea why I bought this. This works well on surface, whitehead pimples, but rarely get those anymore, and when I do I pick on it before I can remember I even own this product. Face palm.  
* Hanhoo Blemish Patch (not pictured) - I use this whenever I get a pimple. I dread looking at my pimples (also a chronic picker), and I usually only get one at a time now so I use the patches everyday at all times on any pimple I have until it goes away. Yeahhh, ikea spice rack by the bed buddies! Ok but I'm digging all your art though!! We have so many similar products. Amazing! I'm just curious, and anyone else who uses it, feel free to answer, but.....  You said that the Hada Labo Premium makes your skin soft and smooth. But, when I use it, my face feels tacky and sticky, even after waiting for it to absorb/dry down. What am I doing wrong? Where is the art frommmm https://i.imgur.com/Fh1TTL5.jpg a picture of my whole wall for those inspired :) I have that same shelf from ikea!!! Your wall of art is amazing! Just echoing the sentiment I know it‚Äôs been said already but your wall is really cool! I‚Äôm going for a similar look and this is giving me lots of ideas. What has helped your PIH AND PIE the most? Is that the IKEA spice rack? Nice shelfie!  Totally agree about the HL Premium.  The best!! we use a lot of the same products! very aesthetically pleasing. I also use the Vanicream cleanser and the TO azelaic acid and I love them so much for my seb derm! Even though your shelfie is awesome I love your art too! Sounds like we have the same kind of skin. Will give hada Labo a shot :)

Do you know which vit c you'll be going for next? If not melano? Feel the same exact way as you for the bikes sunscreen so happy It was recommended to me thru Reddit :) Would love to see the rest of your wall. It looks really cool! i have 6 of the products you have üòÇ we could be friends Dang you and I are skincare twins, use a lot of the same. Nice! Hi, did the Azelaic acid help with your PIE as well? What was your fungal acne routine? Iove this!! Wish i was this organized w/ cute art I‚Äôm not even paying attention to the skincare. Your wall is fucking cool. We love a lot of the same products and seem to have very similar skincare goals/areas to take care of - I find it super helpful to find other routines like mine and/or use similar products to me so thanks for this :) plus, love the mini reviews!

Also, like many of the above comments - love the art! This is GOALS. Is this your shelf in a home you own or have you sneakily put a shelf up in rented property? I‚Äôm hoping my landlord will let me! whats the deal with the sulfur? Scalp? r/dormrooms Wow did you steal all my products we are samies lol Where did you get your shelf? Oh god I‚Äôm new to skin care and I don‚Äôt know any of this. MB drying lotion üòçüòç Is sebamed gel good?I m using sebamed cleanser currently Purty! Ouh I love this, gives me serious pintrest vibes! Saved this photo for wall inspo. Love your wall....and the shelfie. Nice touch. Wow love your wall art! I use the same spice rack shelf! We're buying a house and our bathroom is super small. Thanks for the wall inspiration for where I'll keep my skincare! Ooooo we share a lot of products in common!! Does the sebamed leave a film on your skin after application??

Also do you use this around your eyes as well? How moisturizing is it? Has it caused any milia? Wow i love the products and the whole picture.im getting myself new shelves yay Hey! Nice shelfie! You mentioned that you use the Benton Aloe gel to stretch your sebamed Clear Face gel. But isn't that method more expensive? Afaik, the sebamed gel costs [13,24¬†‚Ç¨/100 ml](https://shop.sebamed.de/fuer-sie/19/pflege-gel?c=34) while the Benton gel costs [18,90 ‚Ç¨ /100 ml](https://benton-germany.de/alle-produkte/3403/benton-aloe-propolis-soothing-gel?c=168) (based on their respective online shops). Just wanted to point this out and save you some money just in case  (not sure where you are from so maybe prices are different).

Edit: Added links to the online shops for reference. I am pretty sure the instruction on the bottles say **"Store in a dark place".**

No sunlight, especially for transparent bottles. The three graces done right! Came for the skincare, stayed for the art Finally found the original artist for that picture! Its @vee_vees on instagram, shes amazing!! https://www.instagram.com/p/84ajJOMxov/?igshid=fe82f7d76j4b That wall is just nice. Me, too! Came here just for that!  :D Shout out for your IKEA spice rack(?), my house is full of them haha :) It seems like our skin likes the same stuff! Azalaic acid is my HG too, it makes my skin so pretty! Also surprised by my skins response to lactic acid - it doesn‚Äôt do shit for acne but the rest of my face looks even and nice with it!
You‚Äôre making me want the Hado Labo, I am plenty moisturized right now but it sounds really nice. What helped with PIH/PIE the most? Was it the Azelaic Acid? Thanks for posting! I think we have similar skin =) I also love the sebamed clear face gel.

Two questions:
1. On days you only wear the biore sunscreen, do you skip ponds and just use the vanicream to remove the sunscreen?
2. I noticed you store the vanicream in your bedroom too. Is it inconvenient at all to pump out cleanser and then go to the bathroom with cleanser in one hand and then wetting your face with the other hand? I‚Äôve been debating on the drying lotion. I think my teenager may get more out of it than I would. We‚Äôre working hard on ‚Äúno picking‚Äù alternatives for her but she‚Äôs having a hard time judging results vs. resisting the urge. Do you not use a moisturizer at night? You should try mixing the Niacinamide with the snail mucin. Works perfectly for me :) Seriously? That thing is good for everything! Came here to say this. OP, have you got a shop or a portfolio site so we can look at your work? oh yea my skin also feels tacky and sticky lol, but it goes away when I apply the rest of my products. following. This happens to me even when using 1 layer and pat in I usually do two layers of it. The first sinks in really fast but the second stays a little sticky until I put my moisturizer on. Then it isn‚Äôt sticky anymore and my face feels really soft! everything is mine :))  except for the three black and white girls on the right and the two hands. been trying to find the artist for the b&w one since everyone loved it but i still can‚Äôt find it :( idk if i can plug my insta here for you to see the rest of my art but here it goes anyways lol @sharaah.s Honestly I have so many different products that help PIH that I cant be completely sure of which one has been the most effective, but I been the most consistent with the Vitamin C and the Niacinamide, so  I think those two have probably been the most helpful. For PIE, all the hydrating layers i do are whats made the most difference. i really don‚Äôt know because my main problem with Vit C is stability. i‚Äôve used other vit c products and don‚Äôt finish them before they go bad or put them in the fridge and forget about them, so i‚Äôll either keep repurchasing melano cc or try one of the ordinary formulas. thank you!! https://i.imgur.com/Fh1TTL5.jpg I sneakily put this shelf up in my rented apartment lol, although this shelf only needs two small holes to be installed so i dont think its a problem i use it as a face mask whenever i feel my skin is freaking out, about to break out or if i‚Äôm having a fungal flare up Looks like an Ikea spice rack :) i love it!! Its not the most moisturizing thing in the world tho, i have to back it up with the Hada Labo Premium and the squalane oil, but it feels amazing on my skin and doesn‚Äôt break me out which is a win. not at all!! my skin absorbs it perfectly. I do apply it around my eyes, no irritation. the downside is that it is not as moisturizing, its a very simple gel, but the upside to that is that it doesnt cause any breakout on my skin, milia either (at least not on me personally) Thank you for this!!! Im in the US and I buy everything on Amazon. The sebamed gel is $14 for 50ml on Amazon so it ends up being more expensive for me and the benton gel is only $12 for 100ml! Thank you! Love love love that. Wish I could get a print So I have a tapestry of this but kind of different (skulls instead of faces and all black and white) but it‚Äôs a circa survive tapestry and now I‚Äôm wondering if it was stolen artwork We use them for the kids' books. Was looking for something for my colognes, in order to make room in the medicine cabinet for the skincare stuff, but never thought of these. Gonna have to pick some more up. Same here!! Came to comment this same thing üòÇ yea i been thinking for dropping the lactic acid and using only azelaic acid every day but im scared lol the azelaic acid has definitely helped TREMENDOUSLY, but ive only been using it for about 3 weeks, so before that I think the vit c was helping the most. Theres also a lot of products in my routine that help PIH one way or the other, so its hard to tell. 1.	i just use the Vanicream to remove sunscreen, i feel like its prettt effective.
2.	its so funny you ask because that‚Äôs exactly what i do and it is really inconvenient lol but ive gotten used to it. i live with my parents and siblings and we all share a bathroom, so leaving anything in there is dangerous. i think the pimple patches are a better alternative for no picking. Cosrx sells some thin, seamless ones she can wear outside if she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable wearing the normal ones. yes!! the Sebamed gel and the Benton Aloe gel are both moisturizers. but seriously to have that extensive of a daily routine with THAT many products is nuts. Kim Kardashian probably has a simpler routine. Maybe a psychologist is needed lol :) hey!! Thank you sooo much, all of my work is on my instagram, @sharaah.s Ahhhh you‚Äôre SO talented! Just added ya ‚ù§Ô∏è You‚Äôve inspired me to put up some of my own stuff or create something new to hang üòç we should swap a piece! PS yassss girl your makeup posts are the shit too!!! üòçüòçüòç Omg I love the calendar, where did you get it from? You could always fill in the holes before you leave! I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what storage I can have in my flat when I move next month. The last person left picture hooks in the walls and apparently didn‚Äôt get into trouble so I guess I‚Äôm gonna be okay? 

But anyway: your skin care routine is SO good üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª what do you use each TO formula for? I‚Äôve got the AHA + BHA and squalane (yaaaaas) but I‚Äôm thinking of including some others. Kk ..ty..maybe i will try out You could [buy the original for $500](https://www.virginiazamora.com/shop) It's all a riff on the three Grace's from Greek mythology. I wouldn't call it stolen just directly inspired. My boyfriend's fragrances are sitting in one right now, can confirm works a charm! :) That‚Äôs an idea! I don‚Äôt love the heavy silicone feel of the Ordinary all over my face, though - I think I‚Äôd want to try a serum or something if it was going all over maybe? I've been using the Melano CC for over a week now and it's showing some results, and have a Cosrx snail mucin bottle waiting to be opened. I also use TO niacinamide ..trying to see if it would be worth to add the azelaic acid into my routine ü§î Omg i get what you mean by 2 hahaha. I used to share with a whole group of siblings too.

Cool thanks for the tip about vanicream! Do you use vani and sunscreen on the sensitive area around your eyes too (eye bags, below the brow)? When I use vani to take off other types of sunscreen I find I have to rub it in for a minute or so, which tends to irritate the skin around my eyes. I‚Äôm fairly new to this sub and I have never heard of pimple patches. Thanks for the suggestion! I‚Äôm trying not to pass on to her outdated/lackluster skincare advice, so stuff like this is a big help. i think as long as YOUR routine is simple and short, you dont really have to worry about mine :) On Amazon!! Its called Lunaria Lunar calendar :) The squalane oil is the TO product i repurchase the most!!!! Also the niacinamide, which really helps my skin be oil, break out free. People either love it or hate it tho. Holes for hanging things usually fall under acceptable wear and tear, at least in places I‚Äôve lived. I imagine it would say in your lease Weird that she offers no print copy options. Most artists will do that. Idk how to link a photo I‚Äôve never used imgur before but I double checked. Like the position the hand raise everything is the same yea me too, i use it only on my cheeks for that reason :/ but there‚Äôs not a lot of affordable options for me that don‚Äôt need a prescription. i been eyeing melazapam tho, but i‚Äôve heard the texture is also tricky. have you looked at other alternatives? do you have any other actives in your routine? I am honestly overwhelmed with my routine lol, I just recently stopped using BHA (stridex) and been thinking of dropping the Lactic Acid to use the azelaic acid more consistently and often, im scared to overexfoliate. I think you should definitely try the azelaic acid out bc its really amazing, once you learn how to deal with the texture of it. i haven‚Äôt been using anything on my eyes bc my allergies has my eyelids and the skin under my eyes SUPER fucked up, so everything burns a little. But in general i do use sunscreen and the cleanser around my eyes and dont experience irritation, but will all the rubbing and stuff i dont think theres a lot of sunscreen left around my eyes at the end of the day so im not too enthusiastic cleansing around my eyes. The pimple patches are great for compulsive pickers. I usually can't control myself but the hydrocolloid bandages/pimple patches are great damage control for overnight healing. You're right. But damn you're doing your thing and getting results and you're dedicated as fuck. Respect girl Oooh I was thinking about getting the niacinamide next! Yeah I‚Äôll check that particular section later & see. It wasn‚Äôt my most important question so I‚Äôll figure it out later ‚ò∫Ô∏è [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYUyQNhg1Lz/), she tells another person looking for prints that she does sell prints and to DM her to get a print. I was thinkinggggg about trying the Garden of Wisdom one? It‚Äôs cheaper than Paula‚Äôs Choice and they have other products I‚Äôd love to try. Still just doing TO, though, right now! I don't use any others atm but also have a tub of glycolic acid pads waiting to be opened üò´ def overwhelmed too lol.. but I def want to incorporate TO azelaic acid at some point since I keep hearing about how amazing it is! I do dislike silicony textures though üò∂ Oh wow we are skincare twins! The skin under my eyes is a bit messed up too, permanently red these days =/ Oh thank you for taking the time to find that! Oh my God it must feel *amazing* to apply cold skincare products from the fridge. And here I am thinking this would be perfect to store all my reptile food in so my roommate doesn‚Äôt have to deal with mealworms in our communal fridge, lol. Can I be ignorant and ask if these products need to be kept cold and/or does it just improve the quality of the product? I‚Äôve heard cold water opens(?) your pores more, or something along those lines. I‚Äôm very unknowledgeable when it comes to the science behind it, but nevertheless, I‚Äôve taken advice from this sub and my skin has improved a LOT.  > this new level of crazy

ONE OF US. ONE OF US.

Seriously, though, I *love* these little fridges, even if they do make me seem like I take skincare a little *too* seriously. Products You Can See:
1.	j-one Jelly Pack
2.	Tatcha Violet-C Radiance Mask
3.	IT Cosmetics Secret Sauce
4.	laneige Sleeping Mask
5.	Jade Roller from FabFitFun


Out of all these, the Tatcha mask is my treasure. I feel like it‚Äôs my first mask that really makes an immediate difference in my skin.

I still haven‚Äôt decided exactly what to keep in here, but doing a better job at maintaining routines is my goal for 2019, and I think this is a good tool to help me do it. That's so nice!  Jealous!  How do you feel about the Laneige
Water Sleeping Mask and the Tatcha Violet-C Mask?  I've had both of those things on my maybe to buy list.  I'm especially unsure of the Tatcha with that price tag.  The reviews are so stellar though.  Ugh.  

edit:  a word.  also not really sure why I'm being down voted... sorry if I broke some rules? I had a small fridge like this for a while. They are ok but do not get very cold. It did not seem to make much difference in the long run so I got rid of it. I used to own one for my apple cider vinegar toner. But it broke after 4 mos :( I want one of these but i would also like to know how much it would effect my power bill?  Ok, I have to ask.  Do magnets stick to it? I got this same fridge for Christmas. I love putting sheet masks in there!  I need this for my Vitamin C serum.... so I don't have to walk all the way down to my kitchen to use it (which, let's be honest, is a deterrent to using it)!  Take out the top shelf for more room! I stack mine! [It's great! ](https://i.imgur.com/3uJj26r.jpg) Unpopular opinion: consumerism exemplified. Why can a person not pull their products from the fridge in the kitchen? Yuck. This is glorious 

P.S contacts feel amazing in the fridge too I got the same one at a white elephant this year. I‚Äôm using it right now for extra breastmilk storage in the bedroom, quite convenient!  I have the same one; this is a great idea!!! I use mine for energy drinks next to my desk though üòÇ I got a mini retro Frigidaire for Christmas and I can confirm it feels *amazing* to put on cool skincare in the morning/night. I was neglecting my jade roller but now I look forward to it at night. Yay, I didn't know this was a thing! I have a small window in my bathroom that has a ledge where I keep my skincare products because it's cold there in the winter and I always thought it felt nice to put cool product on my face. I'm glad to know others like to keep their skincare products cool! Where did you find this ?! This is so cute!! Where did you find this???  Can I ask what products these are and what they do for your skin? Do they work? What differences have you seen? :) help pls! I had one like that. Make sure to check if it has a hot option. Mine could be set to hot or cold. After a couple of years, it broke and went to hot on its own. I noticed after my sodas exploded. Oh my, this would be perfect for summer months! Using this during winter weather would probably have me frozen to death lol Oooooooh nice! What kind of fridge are you using? I was meaning to get the Cooluli fridge but omg \~$70 out I was like.. no.. not yet lol I'll know I've made it when I buy a tiny fridge for my skincare - but for now my face masks live in my regular fridge. I was thinking earlier to get a small fridge so I don't have to go back and forth from the kitchen just to get my skin care products from the fridge. Everyone in my house knows how complex my routine is because I am always near the fridge lol.  This is the level I aspire to be.  [Same](http://imgur.com/a/c7FCChx) girl, same. I want one even though I have no products that need refrigeration.  Just have to say I LOVE this idea and will definitely be purchasing a similar fridge once I get married this summer for our new place. How do you like that Jelly Pack? The pore-smoothing effect caught my eye! I think I need this Where did you get the fridge!!! Lol Can we blame Michelle Lee for starting this? My moisturizer felt like 10x more luxurious this morning. And the jade roller!  Have two of these, can confirm. The coldness also helps reduce redness, and my cold "jade" roller reduces puffiness (simple massage would do the same thing, but I can't keep my hands in the fridge...). Jarred/potted face masks also feel 153% fancier when they're cold. i live in southern az where it routinely hits 110's in the summer and i started putting my moisturizer in the fridge and it feels so damn good. 10/10 would recommend. Perfect for all of life's addictions... from skin to scales! Lol, I saw the title and was like, "oh, you mean my breast milk fridge?"

 I was very glad when my beardie grew up. Large quantities of kale look a lot less weird than large quantities of mealworms in the fridge. The soda-like fizzy sound was the worst.  cold products feel a LOT more refreshing, and can help certain products (like vitamin c) from expiring as fast. cold products/water can also help to reduce swelling and redness. As a teen I was actually prescribed a topical acne medication that supposedly NEEDED to be refrigerated. I‚Äôm guessing there was some ingredient in it that would spoil at room temperature. Not all products can be put in a cold environment. Some have a max temp of 15-30 deg. Since companies have their stability testing on that temp, it will kind of degrade the stuff in a higher or lower temp. Just be careful and read the labels still. One of my REN products, a soothing serum suggests on the label you can stick it in the fridge for even more soothingness-ess. lol. No none if the particular products shown need to be in a fridge.  It feels nicer when cold and can sometimes also work better when applied cold for some products. Cold generally will help shrink appearance of pores and warn/hot opens up pores more.

Primary benefit of cold products is that it helps deal with any puffiness. Warm water/steam opens your pores, while cold makes them close up. Cold also reduces puffiness and inflammation.  Just FYI I‚Äôm 99% sure heat opens your pores, cold water closes (somewhat).

..if this is the case does the cold inhibit some absorption? Uhhhh, where does one find one of these tiny fridges? You know, so I don't accidentally buy one and look crazy too. Wouldn't want that. oh don't worry, I'm on the hunt for one of these tiny fridges.  so curious about the jelly pack - how do you like it so far? How much product do you use for the laneige sleeping mask? I recently found out about it and am new to this sub. I got a sample from sephora and have been using maybe a dime worth? Just enough to cover my face, but there isn't anything to wipe off in the morning since it just absorbs into my skin. I want sure how this product worked. Thanks! I‚Äôve emptied the laneige and wouldn‚Äôt repurchase. It‚Äôs not hydrating enough and felt kinda drying after it absorbed, i researched the ingredients and there are basically no occlusives, so I had to mix other things in it to make it work. I‚Äôm combo skin btw.
Then i started using the belif one and that‚Äôs waaaay better.  This is obviously anecdotal, but I have used up a deluxe sample size of the Tatcha mask and I thought it was really good but I honestly get the same exact effects from that as I do from the farmacy bright on vitamin c mask. They're both encapsulated vitamin c formulas in a kaolin clay base with fruity AHAs, and though the Tatcha ingredient list is definitely more streamlined (and I haven't done a detailed dive into their differences), I saw similar results on my face and the farmacy one is 30 bucks cheaper. If you're really interested, I strongly suggest going and getting samples of each from Sephora! Then you could see if the price difference is worth it for you.  It‚Äôs very small, and can be run off a car inverter, so I‚Äôm guessing not too much. I agree with you. I have a couple of face masks that I keep in my regular fridge. (they are also meant to be refrigeratored.) I can't imagine buying a small fridge just for my bathroom. Posts like this and the massive "shelfies" with an absurd amount of products irk me. I wish I could have a western skincare sub that behaved like the Asian beauty sub. (more discussion/reviews. Less selfies and product hauls.)  Honestly, it‚Äôs because I spend a lot of money on skincare products and cook a lot of fragrant foods. My fridge smells like curry and garlic, I don‚Äôt want my $60 moisturizer to smell like masala.

But thanks for your bravery!  I have a flat mate and we just don‚Äôt have enough fridge storage. My flat mate doesn‚Äôt really care but I can imagine someone else being weirded out by some non-food items in a communal refrigerator. 


We actually each have our own waist-high mini fridge for beer and I put my sheet masks, vacuum sealed hoarded discontinued makeup shades, and seasonal perfume in the one I share with my husband.  Because I don‚Äôt want to walk to the fridge.  Eh, I would say egregious consumerism is more about people accumulating things they don't really need just for the sake of having them. This actually has some function, even though it is a little extra. Be angry about all those giant flat lays of people's palette collections that they'll never ever use up on /r/makeupaddiction, not this. They have the means and get enjoyment out of it. They admitted it looks crazy but it works for them and isn't hurting anyone so more power to them. 

&#x200B; Smartest idea ever!! Where can I get one?  OP linked the amazon page in a reply to another comment. Such a steal! I've seen fridges that size go for $60+ I got this one, it was cheaper before Christmas! Gourmia GMF600 Thermoelectric Mini Fridge Cooler and Warmer - 4 Liter/6 Can - For Home,Office, Car, Dorm or Boat - Compact & Portable - AC & DC Power Cords - White https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQT2ZGE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_o1KkCbRGWH5Y0 I was going to comment on putting a jade roller in there and then I spotted it. Nice set up! How do you like the jade roller? I feel like its a gimmick? I‚Äôm putting it in regular fridge!  That‚Äôs it!  I used this same fridge for my injections for egg retrieval haha  Huh, that‚Äôs interesting! I do have redness on my face a lot, I‚Äôll have to try that out üòä thanks! Some LUSH face masks stay fresher in the fridge! Like cupcake and don‚Äôt look at me! When I was too young to swallow tablets I‚Äôd get liquid antibiotics that would always need to be refrigerated. It seems plausible that antibiotic creams would need to be refrigerated too? Isn‚Äôt the pore thing a myth though? They don‚Äôt have muscles and can‚Äôt open/close. Pores don‚Äôt open and close. :) I think what you‚Äôre thinking of is vasodilation vs vasoconstriction. Heat brings more blood flow, cold restricts blood flow and reduces inflammation.  Depends on how hard you want to look and how much you want to spend!

Walmart had them for $20 on BF, but they were still available at that price for a few weeks after. I got my first one in early-ish December. I found the second accidentally about 10-14 days ago (my concept of time sucks these days), despite the app claiming to be OOS in my entire area. The app/site seems to be really inaccurate: it claims to have some in stock where there are none and claims to be OOS where they had them (when I found my second, I checked the app while standing in front of two of them in the aisle, and it claimed to be OOS). They're still out there, but finding them requires checking physically and hoping for the best.

On the other hand, they're easier to find on eBay, but for a higher cost: I see some there now for $35-50 depending on color and seller, most with free shipping at least. 

Not sure about OP's (that is, if it's a different brand; looks the same on the inside!), but mine's a Frigidaire Retro Mini 6 can/4L Beverage Refrigerator. There are other options/brands out there, but none I've seen at $20!

Edit: [Also seems to be one on Amazon for ~$32](https://smile.amazon.com/Curtis-Mini-Beverage-Refrigerator-Black/dp/B01MTK2RRZ), if red's cool. Different branding (RCA) but looks to be the same design. If you search on amazon ‚Äútiny fridge‚Äù a good amount pops up for not that much ü•∞ You can also get one at Target during the Back to School sales. We sell tons of them for kids to chill sodas in their dorm rooms.  Found a bunch in Walmart  I use about the same amount. This is my third sample size of it I‚Äôve gotten, but I don‚Äôt really have particular feelings about it. I might be wrong, but I think "sleeping masks" are confusingly labeled. I've never used one and had any residue to wipe off in the AM, like you'd expect with a "mask"; they all seem to absorb pretty well. I find I use very little and that by morning there‚Äôs nothing REALLY there but I still wipe my face off. Sleeping masks don‚Äôt stay on like normal face masks.  Thank you!  That's really good advice!  I'm gonna try that before I splurge on the Tatcha! Where did you buy it?

Edit: I saw the link, never mind. :) I upvoted you, haha, not that it matters. I also keep my tretinoin and a couple other things in the fridge. I find it funny that ppl here assumed that because we think it's gross consumerism, we are angry. Oh well! I‚Äôm sorry,  but I think they‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs nice you like your mini-fridge but that seems like an unnecessary and wasteful use of power for something you don‚Äôt seem to have planned out using before you bought it. 

If you aren‚Äôt leaving anything open in the fridge I don‚Äôt even know how it would smell like food?

I‚Äôm not trying to bring you down here, so apologies for sounding negative, I just don‚Äôt like this as a trend. I think makeup and skincare enthusiasts should embrace a move away from unnecessary extras like this.

Edit: structure I hear you. I make Indian food at home. I don't want my stuff smelling like it. I don't like putting on my creams in the powder room downstairs, and I certainly am not going to bring everything up to my bathroom and take it down again every day and night.  Lol exactly! Is probably forget to use tons of stuff if I kept it in my kitchen fridge! An excessive amount of palettes aren‚Äôt constantly using power, though. OP could put this in a regular fridge! 

In my view they are both distasteful for different reasons. Mine was a secret Santa gift but I have reason to believe it‚Äôs from Walmart! Thanks! Can I ask what you use a jade roller for? I‚Äôve seen them around but never knew what you used them for. My sister got one recently and I took the piss a bit because it's a stone on a stick what can it do?? But damn it feels good rolling it on cold still don't think it does anything but the satisfaction alone is worth it üòÇ I got one from Marshalls!  It was cheaper than others I‚Äôve seen.  It feels awesome when it‚Äôs cold. I kinda wanna get one of these just for the name alone but I‚Äôve heard really good things about these.  They have to be in the fridge in order to have shelf life. The raw ingredients ( like egg ) require that. All of the fresh face masks have to be refrigerated and only good for a week or so.

If they‚Äôre on the ice, they need to be refrigerated. Ah yes, the pink stuff ü§§ 
Good point. You‚Äôre mostly right, they do not technically open or close and don‚Äôt have muscles. But like most matter, any sebum or debris inside the pores softens and can be freed with heat or consolidated with cold, making the space inside ‚Äúopen‚Äù or ‚Äúclose.‚Äù So it‚Äôs not a change in shape of the pore itself, but how free the space inside the pore is.  It does have some truth to it though so not entirely a false myth. 

Although pores don't have constricting muscles they do have some miosin / actine proteins as part of the celular structure of their cells and the epidermal layer of the skin, also some for individual capilar folicules (ever experience briztled of the skin? Those are muscle fibers pulling the hairs) 

No, the ones that react to heat and cold are the blood vessels, they do have smooth muscles fibers, straight and constructive ones, and they control the dilation of pores and transudate of skin glands.  I know this is just my own experience and not a study, but I've been washing my face with cold water for the part few months and have noticed less acne/oiliness. I think the hot water was making my skin dehydrated. Right, they‚Äôre not like windows lol.  So why do they heat your face when giving you a facial and tell you it‚Äôs ‚Äúopening your pores‚Äù..? Does it have anything to do with absorption..? [deleted] Wow. I don‚Äôt know if I can justify having one, but damn do I really, really want one. ü§î Yeah I guess it depends on the product. But even then it is still confusing because all sleeping masks directions I read say to wip off in the morning. I guess I need to find something where there is actually something to wash off, because otherwise my skin isn't staying hydrated Haha! I am not angry. Mildly annoyed maybe. Now, I was angry right Thanksgiving when everytime I turned around there was a post about these fridges. It annoys me because only certain oils or actives "need" to be refrigerated. But they weren't discussing that, it's just "look at my stuff!" It was just posts about fridges and added nothing to the discussion of skincare!

I just don't want this sub to turn into another makeup addiction. Ugh. That sub can be a total mess.   Little late here, but it feels like you‚Äôre coming off a bit judgemental? Maybe i‚Äôm missing something or making too much of an assumption myself, but it would seem most people use these mini fridges (primarily) for the products that require refrigeration or for products that directly benefit otherwise from refrigeration, rather than because they want their product application to feel more ‚Äúluxurious‚Äù. 

Some of us live upstairs. It‚Äôs an absolute bitch to have to run down stairs for something, back up to apply, back down to put it away, then back up to finish your routine/getting ready.

Even if two levels aren‚Äôt involved, surely I am not the only one who will sometimes forgo products because I‚Äôm way too beat or in too much of a hurry to make the round trip. Even if I do go get it, I may forget or be so short on time that I don‚Äôt put it back. That wouldn‚Äôt ever be an issue if I had it on hand with the rest of my products.

Also, if there are many inhabitants in the house, fridge space may be very limited, and obviously food is going to take priority over skincare. Maybe someone has roommates who don‚Äôt want such ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù near their food (has happened to me), or otherwise find it unsanitary. 

I once had a girlfriend who was a VERY light sleeper, and I woke up well before her for work. Our bathroom was in our bedroom and I never failed to wake her up when I went to grab my vitamin c (and put it back). I eventually stopped using it because of that. It would have been SO much more convenient if I could have just showered, finished my full routine, got dressed, and only wake her when I went to say goodbye.

Personally, I also have severe ADD and most of the time I try to retreive a refrigerated product, I forget what the hell I‚Äôm doing by the time I leave my room/bathroom. 

‚ÄúUhh, what did I need again? I guess I‚Äôm here for food..?‚Äù Eat or wander around aimlessly a bit, then head back to the bathroom and think, ‚Äúnow what do I need to do? Oh yeah, skin stuff... what step was I on...? Oh shit, THAT‚ÄôS why I was in the kitchen!!!‚Äù

 And it‚Äôs def not unheard of for me to forget what I was doing back to back, either. That forgetting and walking back and forth shit takes time. Even neorotypicals can forget wtf they were supposed to be doing upon entering a totally different room, especially when it‚Äôs early in the morning or late at night.

And you know what, sometimes I just don‚Äôt feel like waking up the pets. The second anyone leaves the bedroom first thing in the morning, they are UP, playing and being loud and waking up half the house. I go to work very early, so it‚Äôs usually me who ends up waking the beasts, and I am sure my roommates would love 30 extra minutes of restful sleep by me not having to pull my vitamin C or oils from the fridge, inevitably causing animal commotion and hooliganry.

There is very valuable function and convenience to something like this for a lot of people. And while there may be other practical solutions, I still don‚Äôt think that necessitates that this particular solution is unreasonable or excessive. 

Just seems like you‚Äôre coming off a bit harsh. Even if someone were doing it for ‚Äúluxurious‚Äù reasons, I am fairly certain the power used is relatively negligible and you have no way of knowing if they actively compensate for that use elsewhere.
 Ohhhh cool, I should check it out - looks amazing for this purpose!  I use mine for puffiness. If you put it in the fridge it's nice and cold and feels good. I have also used it to apply argan oil on my face. It rolls on smoothly and distributes it evenly. Yup! From what I‚Äôve read, there‚Äôs no real ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù, besides it feeling nice on your face. Which is good enough if you like it.  What‚Äôs the point of if though? AMOXICILLIN üòçüòç

I have a vivid memory of forgetting to take it before school so my mom came in to give it to me and everyone was asking for some after I told them it was ‚Äúthe pink stuff‚Äù lol. I‚Äôve never felt more like ~royalty~. As an adult I've asked for that stuff instead of tablets many times and they never give it to me. I can taste it just thinking about it. Hot water will strip your moisture barrier, but not because of pores. It's simply by washing it off. Lukewarm and cold water are better for it, and either way you want to keep the washing short. Same reason why your skin tends to be plumper post shower. Helping with absorption is... not quite correct?  

Instead what is happening is that your skin is engorging in water (same reason your fingers get wrinkly in a shower or bath - the cells are full of water) and any topicals that follow are sealing in that excess water or at least reducing the amount of water that evaporates (what is referred to as TEWL or trans epidermal water loss). 

This is also why dermatologists recommend immediately moisturizing, while your skin is still wet. Drying off the water takes some of the moisture/water in your skin with it. Further, neglecting to moisturize your skin after the shower, once towel dried, while the barrier is most disrupted and fragile (meaning most stripped of natural lipids), increases TEWL simply because your skins natural barrier against water loss isn‚Äôt all there (normal skin takes about 30m to return to normal IIRC. This is higher for anyone with acne, rosacea, eczema, etc).

Steaming and heat though can really exacerbate some skin conditions though, esp rosacea. So I just sat here for about 60 solid seconds trying to figure out if I made a typo somewhere or was maybe having a stroke somehow, or if maybe you were crazy and the comment just didn't make sense -- and then I saw it. I have... so many questions. Whoa wtf‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs so weird You‚Äôre right, I was absolutely being judgemental, perhaps I could have phrased it more neutrally but anti-consumption and minimal waste is a topic I am passionate about. OP said in another comment they didn‚Äôt know what they were going to use the fridge for, which implied an impulse purchase that doesn‚Äôt serve a purpose beyond decorative - I may have been completely wrong in this assumption, and if I was I apologise.

But your comment brings me to another topic I‚Äôm really interested in, and that‚Äôs the intersection between environmentalism and disability activism (both which I am involved in). I‚Äôm not sure how familiar you are with the plastic straw debate, but people with disabilities are often forgotten in the discussion - able people want to eliminate plastic straws without considering that many people need them to survive, and that other alternatives (bamboo, stainless steel, etc.) aren‚Äôt viable for many reasons.

I don‚Äôt view this subject in quite the same way since a skincare fridge is (I assume) not a matter of survival for most people, but I‚Äôll say the same thing I do for straws - if these were only used by people with mental health issues and other disabilities, it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. It‚Äôs when it‚Äôs touted as a fun accessory for **everyone** that the damage to the environment accumulates.

You don‚Äôt owe me an explanation for why you want a mini-fridge, and neither does OP. I certainly do things in my life that aren‚Äôt great for the environment and I am still working on that myself. Nobody needs my permission to do anything! I just wanted to give my two cents to this discussion. I just don‚Äôt like seeing consumption like this normalised without context.

Thank you for adding your perspective, I do appreciate it.

Edit: Typos and clarity Ooh I'm going to need to try this with my argan oil, it sounds heavenly! I think it helps with puffiness and it can help creams to better absorb.  It also just feels really nice on your skin when you wake up or after a long day. I was prescribed that somewhat regularly for ear infections when I was like 3-4, and I liked it so much that one time, I just took the bottle out of the fridge and started drinking it. :P "Bubblegum medicine" was the shit.  I had it as a kid.... Liked the taste so much I downed the bottle one morning. Mom was not pleased Ask your doctor to write the script for liquid instead? If they give you the pill script the pharmacy won‚Äôt usually fill it liquid, especially if it‚Äôs something they‚Äôd have. To compound special. 

I had to get a liquid once but that‚Äôs because I was sloooowly changing the dose of an antidepressant and it‚Äôs hard to cut 3mm diameter pills accurately. But that shit tasted *awful* Wow, thanks for this!!! I had no idea I should moisturize while my skin is still wet. Does this go for washing your face and following with a retinol? I clicked on the link just to see this and I, too, am confused. I‚Äôm using adapalene and I still moisturize immediately and then about 20 mins later, apply adapalene ontop. It doesn‚Äôt seem to reduce efficacy for me but does reduce irritation.  Do you like the Coola drops?? I‚Äôve been thinking about getting them! I‚Äôm thinking about buying some The Ordinary products, are they as good as people say? [Divider](https://www.containerstore.com/s/12-section-acrylic-nail-polish-riser/d?q=Nail%20polish&productId=10034471) that I am using here

Skin type: normal to dry

Skin goals: reduce pigmentation and sun spots, even out tone and increase brightness

AM: subq eyes, euk 134%, hyaluronic acid 2% + b5, spf (sometimes bronzer or retinol if I‚Äôm feelin it, I don‚Äôt wear makeup, so the bronzer feels like a little extra treat)

PM: skinfix barrier eye, tlc framboos, rose hip seed oil, protini cream, lip sleeping mask

note: just recently tried to add the l-absorbic acid into my pm routine and made my face insanely sticky - very sad about this

top 3:
protini polypeptide - I absolutely love this lotion and hate that it is $60, ha ha. You would think it is just the same as any other lotion but I haven‚Äôt found any other product that feels so creamy and glowy for 8 hrs straight. One pump (or a half pump) is enough for my entire face and it smooths easily. Only criticism I have is the packaging makes it hard to know when you‚Äôve run out. When you run out it basically feels like the pump is stuck, and then your heart breaks a little when you realize you‚Äôre out. 

subq eyes - a new buy for me but I really dig it. Creamy and light but it does not irritate my eyes (I have had both the skinfix and the supergoop moisturizer severely irritate my eyes - supergoop was so bad that I had to toss it). The smell is pleasant. I don‚Äôt feel like this stays on and moist like the protini lotion does. 

d-bronzi - I would not have ever thought to buy a bronzer to include in my routine, but fell victim to trying out the tester at Sephora. The way it smoothed out and the considerable tone change between one hand vs my other was crazy. I am a swimmer and my body is often a shade darker than my face, so this is a nice touch to even things out for special occasions. I usually mix one pump of bronzer with ~3 drops of rose hip seed oil. I think next time I buy I will also pick up a lighter oil for this mixing. It takes a bit of time to rub in and a little extra care to make sure no spots are missed, but it gives a nice natural looking glow that isn‚Äôt streaky and seems pretty good with sweat and water. I used this before a water balloon toss competition and did not look like a tiger or leopard afterwards. Oh my godddd the nail polish divider is boutta change my whole organization game, you are an angel I LOVE this idea! Thank you!! Thanks for the amazing tip! And love your collection. I have that Laneige lip mask as well and it works like a charm for dry, chapped lips! Totally off-topic but I have the exact same retainer-box. Excellent taste! why would you keep your drunk elephant tlc bottle open?? just to suffer? Oh wow that's a great idea! I have a lot of products that size. Nice.  I use the same storage system for gemstone aura spray bottles.  I love how everything has a place. A place for everything and everything in its place! Shout out for that really nice organization. I love it! I just bought that Laneige lip mask! I hope it‚Äôs good! You have the exact same retainer case that I had like 10 years ago! I have a brand new never opened bottle of the Coola if you are interested in having it. I purchased it after testing one, but now I feel like the tester was too oily and broke me out. :( How do you like the Shiseido sunscreen? I have the oil makeup remove which I adore so I‚Äôm thinking of trying a sunscreen from their brand What‚Äôs the one with green cover ? How do you use the vitamin C powder? Have a good DIY recipe? How do you like the ordinary mask? This is so satisfying Love the idea. Will definitely try the dividers with my TO products! Thanks for sharing! I have more product overlap with you than anyone else I‚Äôve seen in this sub haha! Right down to the retainer case (that is a retainer right?)

How do you like the Shiseido sunscreen? This looks exactly like my shelfie. I love the caffeine eye cream peeping in the back corner. I also have the same three DE products on the bottom. D bronzi is a HG item. The retinol melted my face off wicked smaht I really wanted to love that Protini Polypeptide cream but it kinda dried my skin out and wasn‚Äôt moisturizing enough for me :/ How do you like the a-pasioni? I just got it a couple weeks ago and have only been able to use it buffered , twice a week. How do you like the hylamide subq eyes?!? I‚Äôm thinking of getting it for anti-aging purposes. May I ask your age? I‚Äôm 21 but trying to be proactive about anti-aging.. also how do you like the caffeine eye cream? Where did you get your tray if you don't mind me asking? My
G I did like it! It‚Äôs almost out, so I was giving the shiseido a shot. The coola drops smell a lot better and go on smoother, but I‚Äôm a little worried it doesn‚Äôt provide as much coverage as a more traditional sunscreen. I was hoping that the sunscreenr phone attachment would come out for iPhone already so I could confirm this with more quantitative data :) I like them, and I generally like how customizable their products are based on your skin goals. This website helped me a lot with what I was interested in and some science backed info about pros and cons to their line:

https://theskincareedit.com/2017/08/04/the-ordinary 

I also downloaded an app that I saw recommended on SCA called skincare (I think it was like $2) that helps manage interference between products in their line, and others if you choose to add them. Three words:

Niacinamide and Zinc. 


(Thank me later) I use the Granactive Retinoid 5% once every evening and the AHA/BHA red mask. I really love the products. I decided to use them because I feel like they tell you very directly on the website what is in the product and what to use it for. There is also lots of reviews of the products on this sub so that is very helpful. The biggest reason to try is they are relatively inexpensive. If you buy the retinoid I mentioned and hate it, you‚Äôre only out around 9 dollars. It‚Äôs a cheap investment. Buffet is life for me. So much glow. They‚Äôre amazing better than some high end ones as well! Hi! You have pretty much all the [required Shelfie info](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_7._follow_our_post_requirements) except for a full list of the products pictured and reviews. 

Can you add either:

- Short mini reviews for each of your products (e.g. "Smells like pepperoni pizza and feels like jello but man it really helped with my burgeoning devil horns!")

- or longer in-depth reviews for your top 3, which should at least cover: the packaging, product feel & smell, what are the positive & negative effects, does it do what it should/what you bought it for, and overall opinion

Let know when you‚Äôve added that info :) > Only criticism I have is the packaging makes it hard to know when you‚Äôve run out. When you run out it basically feels like the pump is stuck, and then your heart breaks a little when you realize you‚Äôre out. 

There's a way to check!! I learned this from someone in this sub a while ago. If you put your drunk elephant products over a light source (like your cell phone's flash light) you can see the level of product left.  [Here's a picture example](https://imgur.com/a/otSuEGC). You can see the top maybe fourth of my b-hydra is kind of a yellowish tone where there's still product. It's harder to see the difference in my protini since I'm almost out, but it's more noticeable in person. Hey how do U find the subq? I always felt like while I appreciate the ordinaries bare bones, 'active chemicals only' approach that the other deciem lines where a bit frilly and almost contradicted the ordinaries whole 'all you need are the actives' angle. But i do love buffet which has a tonne of seemingly extra things in it so now I'm wondering about other options I just surprise ran out of Protini cream, while out of town! I love the sanitary packaging, hate that I don‚Äôt know how much is left until it‚Äôs gone. Omg, the divider is such a great idea! Thanks!

So, we have similar skin types and use some of the same products. I have the Deciem/Ordinary "Skincare" app, and I just want to give you a heads up that they warn against using peptides with direct acids and derivative vitamin C. The app gives me a conflict warning if I try to use the Protini with TO AHA/BHA peel or with the DE Framboos. I don't know if it's an evidence-based conflict‚Äîthe app warns against pairing vitamin c and niacinamide,  which has been debunked as far as I understand‚Äîbut I wanted to share just in case. :-) My husband steal my Laneige and it‚Äôs funny but expensive. Works for him tho. It's cute! I came here to say that it's super cute! Is that a no-no? Yes, haha. Though I‚Äôm not that good at wearing them, but I would also feel terribly guilty throwing them out. I was on the fence about it until I tried it in store and it went on pretty smoothly. I like it in general but it kind of smells like hairspray. That is the subq eyes, if you‚Äôre referring to the bottle on the bottom left shelf. Of my three eye creams, it is my favorite. I have tried mixing it with the protini cream and the Rose hip seed oil and have not found a good way to use it just yet. I read online that is it actually one of the best vit C formulas that TO sells because of the concentration and shelf life, but mixing with either of those makes my face pretty sticky to the point it is noticeable and annoying on my face when I lay down to go to bed. 

If you have any tips I am all ears, I really wanted to add vit C to my PM routine since it conflicts with the EUK 134 in the AM. I like it, but it is kind of a painful tingle. I can definitely tell the next day that my skin feels firmer though. Someone recommended limiting use to forehead and chin, which I think I will give it a shot just working in localized areas. 

Bonus: you get to look like a scary murderer before you rub it in. SO and I call it the blood mask Haha! Yes it is a retainer case. If we‚Äôre skin twins, do you have any other recommendations on things I might be missing out on?

The shiseido sunscreen is nice, but is smells kind of like hairspray right when it comes out of the bottle. I like it more than the supergoop sunscreen moisturizer, but less than the coola drops. Though, as I mentioned earlier in the thread, I am not convinced the coola drops provide as much coverage. Yes!!! Did you use the retinol daily? I only use it 2-3 times per week max and worked my way up to that point. The AHA 30% mask from ordinary is pretty painfully tingly for me still, I only use it every now and again. I only use it a few times a week, but I think it has helped. What do you mean by buffered? I‚Äôm 28 and just starting to get fine wrinkles on my forehead, but that is about it. Also really focusing on prevention in the form of sun safety and hydration. 

I like the subq eyes a lot, though I have more issues with puffiness and dark circles in my eye area than anything else. The caffeine eye cream did not seem to help this. There is a link to it in my original comment, comes from the container store I tried so hard to like the shiseido sunscreen but it gave me such a white cast. I use Kiss My Face sunscreen now and I love it. How long do the drops usually last you? Thinking about buying it but I‚Äôm not sure if I wanna spend $40+ if they‚Äôre only gonna last a month The app is fab!
I love how it tells you what you should and shouldn‚Äôt use together.
I realised I was using products that shouldn‚Äôt be using together and my skin got a LOT better in a matter of days.
The Alpha Arbutin and the Niacinamide are my favourite TO products.
I bought the Retinoid one but went to my beautician and said they aren‚Äôt strong enough so she gave a 3% retinol that works well. Though I needed to introduce it very slowly and did experience purging. Was the app called ‚Äúskincare routine‚Äù? That‚Äôs 2.99 but it‚Äôs the only one I can find. Thank you! :) I ordered this the other day! I‚Äôm so excited This is the exact one I ordered today. Is it any good for acne. I'm currently taking Minocycline and using Duac. That combo fucked up my face üò≠ I just bought those two exact products yesterday! I can't wait until I get them! Since the retinoid is very low irritation, do you think I could jump into using it every day? I was thinking of doing it every other day, but I've never used a retinoid before... Added! I accidentally dropped my b-hydra and the product bottle separated from the packaging bottle! The product bottle is actually cylindrical and clear inside so you can see how much you have left. And you can snap it back in place like nothing happened. Not the most practical solution to find out how much product you have left but it works :) haha This is great info! Thank you for sharing the wisdom I got the subq on the deciem website. I really like it! I‚Äôve only had it a week or so, but it smells and feels good, and does not irritate my eyes at all, which I cannot say for the skinfix or inky list eye creams. It is creamy but on the lighter side, does not feel heavy on the eyes. I‚Äôve repurchased this product multiple times. It‚Äôs the only eye product I have ever repurchased. It is absolutely the best for me personally at helping with fine lines, and keeping my eyes looking bright. It is my HG eye serum - I don‚Äôt use anything else with it except I sometimes bring my lotion up and over to seal in all the goodness. 

I‚Äôm scared to try their NIOD eye serum in case it is somehow better - it‚Äôs insanely expensive. Yes, I do use that app as well and it has given me the same warning. I meant to look it up, but hadn‚Äôt really gotten around to it since it didn‚Äôt seem to bother my skin. I also noticed it warned against the use of the DE retinol and protini at the same time, and my understanding was that all DE products were compatible with one another. 

I am fairly new to taking skincare seriously, so I still feel like I have a lot to learn. I find that the Shiseido sunscreen lotion is better than the milky version, and that‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve been using everyday for months now. I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs lasted this long honestly! I don‚Äôt mind the scent myself and I like the consistency and coverage, and I haven‚Äôt been wearing foundation (just a bit of concealer on top) so I find that the sunscreen actually adds evenness to my skin texture.

I also recommend the Drunk Elephant hydro serum (it‚Äôs the one with the light blue cap). It‚Äôs like a drink for your skin, I find it very hydrating. 

I also like the Ole Henriksen vit C serum and the anti-oil line. Sadly I used it for three nights straight right off the bat and just destroyed my skins moisture barrier. It was terrible. I‚Äôm slowly working it back in once or twice a week after taking a few weeks to heal. My fault for being dumb though. And I agree that AHA mask is painful! I‚Äôve started using it on just forehead and chin areas. Mixed with another item to prevent burning. I just used the gel that cam in the box with it thx for the review :) i just started getting serious about sun safety - wearing sunscreen daily... i can't believe i didn't know about the importance of sunscreen sooner! Which kiss my face do you use? Does it leave a white cast? It lasted me about 2 months daily use, with my SO using it every other day, so maybe 3 months total if you aren‚Äôt sharing. The squeeze dropper can be a bit finicky and does not always squeeze enough sunscreen for my entire face. Yep. That looks like the one. Pink background with a raindrop icon. I am loving it so far, I‚Äôve had it less than a week and all the random bumps I‚Äôve had in the last 2 years are basically gone. Nothing had worked, they didn‚Äôt react like acne.

This product basically made them disappear overnight. I think it helped a little with acne, granted I was using Epiduo as well, but I'm a POC so I scar really easily so basically once acne goes away I'm left with a ton of scars and it's been AMAZING to help with the scarring. I use Niacinamide+Zinc in the morning plus oil or moisturizer and at night I use retinol and vitamin C with oil or moisturizer. This regimen has made a huge difference for me I would suggest alternating days just to ease in.  I started at every day but I had used retinoids before. You‚Äôd probably be fine with everyday but better safe than sorry. Cool! Maybe when you finish you could do a review? I'm 29 and I used to smoke all through my 20s, live in Australia and *never* wore sunscreen or a hat... (such an idiot I know I wish I could go back in time n fix *so* many dumb mistakes I made). These days I'm starting to get a bunch of fine lines around my eyes and am definitely on the hunt for anything to help with that Have you tried any of the other subq products? I like this one enough I‚Äôd certainly try another one. Interesting...it doesn't warn me about pairing Protini with TO Granactive Retinoid Emulsion 2%. Great to know they're consistent, lol. I‚Äôll try the lotion next! I still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve settled on a sunscreen, even though it feels like the most important part. 

I have tried the DE hydro serum and really liked it.   I had the [rise + glow](https://www.sephora.com/product/rise-and-glow-P414671?) set from DE and I think I might reorder that when I free up a little cabinet space. I‚Äôve read that the smaller size bottles are both more cost efficient and the shelf like for vit C is short enough that the smaller set is better (at least for the c-firma). 

I might also check out the ole henriksen version if I can‚Äôt crack the code on mixing the l-absorbic acid into my PM routine. I was also looking at the tatcha violet-c, but $90 is pretty steep and again I‚Äôm worried about shelf life. Oh man, that must have sucked (both for your skin and wallet). I try to space out any strong acids - tlc, retinol, or aha mask to like every other day max because I am afraid of exactly this Great that you are doing it so young! I use the kiss my face face factor spf 30 for face and neck. It disappears in to my skin so nicely, no white cast. I usually buy it on amazon. 3 months isn't too bad, might give it a try hehe Really? That‚Äôs great to hear! Thanks for letting me know

I'm about to blow so much money because of this sub lmao Sounds a lot like me, both age and lifestyle. I have two lines on my forehead that I *swear* are from the last few stressful years of work but might actually be a culmination of a lot of things ;) 

Best thing we can do is be good about sun and live a happy healthy hydrated rest of our lives I have not. I have thought about the SubQ face one but I have so many from TO that I am using up, and I keep repurchasing because they work beautifully. However, I do have the Hylamide (same product line) Sensitive Booster. It‚Äôs ok, thin and sinks in nicely but I‚Äôm not sure how well it helps me when I have flare ups on my face. I have the Tatcha violet-c!!! I did find it pretty amazing tbh. It smelled really good to me, and seemed to make a difference the next day on my skin (brighter and more even). I found that it doesn‚Äôt sting the way that the DE Framboos stings a little bit. Just be careful not to use either of those too much... I started using the tatcha one every day and I think it was too much for my skin. :) couldn't agree more! ps I added a little review in my original comment about the subq. If you have any other questions about it let me know and I can try and help. **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

‚Ä¢ Coreelle The Potions Calamine Ampoule: helps to control oil production and hence reduce pore appearance

‚Ä¢ Round Lab Dokdo Lotion: light weight hydrating moisturizer

‚Ä¢ Skin Aqua Tone-up UV Essence: in addition to UV protection, also cancels out yellow tones and brighten up the whole general complexion

‚Ä¢ Innisfree My Lip Balm 11: pretty self-explanatory y'all

‚Ä¢ Round Lab Dokdo Lotion

‚Ä¢ Dalacin T-Gel 1% Acne/Pimple Treatment: spot treatment


***Reviews***

‚Ä¢ **Hada Labo Gokujun Cleansing Oil** - simple but effective at removing light makeup and sunscreen; on nights that I skip double cleansing my skin just doesn't feel as clean as usual

‚Ä¢ **Be Plain Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** - an amazing random discovery; cleans very well and helps with oily-ness; has fine green tea powder and mung bean extract for some extra gentle physical exfoliation

‚Ä¢ **Coreelle The Potions Calamine Ampoule** - helps balance sebum production especially in summer; doesn't smell like anything; super interesting texture; runs out pretty quickly tho but I'll definitely stock more in the near future

‚Ä¢ **Good Molecules Overnight Exfoliating Treatment** - I have the old version with essential oils still but it doesn't irritate my face so it's fine; it lasts a while so I won't be seeing the new no fragrance ver anytime soon; helps with cleaning out pores and reducing sebaceous filaments somewhat

‚Ä¢ **Round Lab Dokdo Lotion** - serum texture; very very light weight but amazing at hydration and moisturization; no smell whatsoever

‚Ä¢ **Skin Aqua Tone-up UV Essence** - physical and chemical hybrid sunscreen (someone correct me if I'm wrong); easy to blend as long as your skin is moisturized properly; harder to blend for drier skin/skin that flakes easily; has color-correction effects

‚Ä¢ **Innisfree My Lip Balm 11** - scent is phenomenal exactly like peach candy, otherwise just a tinted vaseline basically, love the light pink that doesn't make me look dead or sickly

‚Ä¢ **Dalacin T-Gel 1% Acne/Pimple Treatment** - super amazing I cannot sing enough praises about this; all other spot treatment I've tried have never been as effective and fast acting as this one; doesn't smell at all; doesn't sting like SA based spot treatments; you only need so little per use one tube lasts a whole year and more

***Edit: about the Dalacin Gel - Hi! I've been seeing a few questions about this so here is the big reply. The first tube I've ever used was purchased on my trip to jp. I loved it so much but didn't need a new one until around a year later. My second tube was purchased [here](https://www.beyoungandbeauty.com/product-page/dalacin-t-gel-1-10g-10tubes). I saw that it works the same as the first one so I didn't really think much about it but as some commenters pointed out, it's a [prescription antibiotic](https://www.myvmc.com/drugs/dalacin-t-topical-lotion/) (I first got it over the counter however) and it's really up to you to evaluate the pros and cons before use. Please be a concious, informed consumer! What do you use Calamine for?  In the US calamine lotion is used to soothe chicken pox or bug bites.   The pink bottle reminded me of being slathered in calamine lotion as a kid! Hey how do you like the Innisfree lip balm? I just discovered that brand and I‚Äôm debating on trying that. Does it give you any noticeable tint or is it just hydrating? I just got that cleansing oil and I love it! It comes off so clean, I honestly don‚Äôt even think I need to cetaphil cleanser after but my oily skin paranoia can‚Äôt quite let go yetüòÇ Wow I never thought about how students who are claimed by their parents can't get a stimulus check. I really hope your parents help you out in any way, but if they don't, I 100% feel your pain. I used to be in that position. It's nice when you turn 26 despite having to pay for health insurance. i feel your financial situation on a spiritual level Where did you get your Dalacin T-Gel 1% Acne/Pimple Treatment?! My broke student skincare routine was wash with water, drink water I feel u girl üò≠(or guy) If you have a CVS nearby they usually have skin care stuff on sale. Im on that broke college life also and got no benefits cuz I'm an international student. you still might qualify for pandemic unemployment (different from regular unemployment). i did, just waiting for the check. i also didn‚Äôt qualify for regular unemployment or stimulus. The oil cleanser, I keep seeing it everywhere! Is it good? You still have a boatload more skincare than me who qualified for everything lol how is the color correction on the Skin Aqua? I use the gold version and have been curious about the correcting ones! Yup- zero dollars here. I have the exact same Innisfree lip balm and love it! Colour, scent, softness Hope everything gets better for youüíï how do you like the innisfree lip balm? yep I too missed out on all the relief money so I feel your pain (part time essential worker earning barely above the bar to qualify for low wages.. I earned less in one month this summer than what I would have received had I had no jobüôÑüôÑüôÑ) Where can you buy these products though? felt that. hang in there OP!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Are you in Japan? My dermatologist prescribed me „ÉÄ„É©„Ç∑„É≥ T „Ç≤„É´ when I was there. Hang in there, OP! Is the aqua skin sunscreen good? I‚Äôm in the same boat! I always have to remind myself that expensive skin care products does not always mean better products! This is a lovely curated collection and I think even better than my huge ridiculous uncurated collection.  Makes me jealous!  Nice! The Hada labo oil is DA BOMB. Love it, I buy it in bulk on amazon lol.
P.S I also didn‚Äôt qualify for the stimulus check, they screwed us over 
Hopefully we can get the next one (if it passes) was never officially on the books at my place of employment (of 5 years) so didn‚Äôt qualify for unemployment either. feel that pain HARD. also broke college student üò≠ Thanks for clarifying your financial situation. We're all in this together! Going back to skincare, how do you use the Dalacin? Do you find it effective the most when used in new/burgeoning spots or any stage of the spot life it works well? Thanks! And yet you spend money on this. How much did all this cost? It‚Äôs patronizing for me to try to be helpful? Ok bye guess you really can‚Äôt be helpful in today‚Äôs climate w/o being spit on. [deleted] bruh just buy the ordinary what‚Äôs wrong with yall lmao CARES act? Yeeeeep. My whole family always filed taxes ASAP. And my dad originally said he wasn‚Äôt going to claim me this year and then right before we all filed he decided to because ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù and so I was out a $1200 stimulus check and he got the $500 child credit so in reality we were out $700. When my friends got theirs I died a lil inside. My son was in the boat so I split my stimulus check with him! He needed it as much as I did. Same boat. So fucked Ummmm same! But also an international student on top of that! When I looked it up for my little brother, if you're not claimed for 2020, and you qualify for it, you'd get the stimulus when those taxes are done next year. Because the stimulus was done as an advanced credit for 2020 taxes. Apparently Dalacin is Clindamycin. Just know it can cause antibiotic resistance and stop working! thank you for the detailed explanation ! I briefly saw your post less than an hour ago and immediately eyed the Calamine Ampoule. And then ‚Äì I kid you not ‚Äì while I'm checking my work emails I saw a [new lead come through](https://imgur.com/a/ey3AXfi) and it's from CoreÃÅelle. Thanks for introducing me to this affordable brand! Where do u purchase the Dalacin Gel? I‚Äôm interested! If you've ever tried DHC's Oil Cleanser, can you tell me how it compares to Hada Labos Cleansing Oil? I really like DHC's formula and it's great at taking off waterproof mascara but it's fairly pricey. What is a physical vs chemical sunscreen? What is that big white 200 ml bottle on the right of the picture? You forgot to mention it or I failed to find into on it Mostly for sebum control. My sister who is paler uses it for redness reduction. It's especially good for when my skin is feeling irritated from wearing masks for long periods of time! It's also good for clearing up zits if you pick. Not much different than putting it on chicken pox or poison ivy blisters. I mix calamine + desitin diaper cream + a few drops of tea tree oil and it makes the most effective drying lotion ever. I have a couple colors. they def are pigmented. you just have to be wary on what color you pick. i am a fair olive skin color and the light pink and yellow tubes looks super naturual (my lips but better vibes) but the red tube looks like a lipstick on me. my best friend who is African american gets that your lips but better vibe form the red tube one. they are nice an hydrating. no need to reapply every 5 seconds. Yes the tint is obvious. Mine (#11) is a lighter color compared to others that they have but it still gives an adequate tinting effect. Though hydrating, it feels like every other lip balm out there. I really only got it bc of the smell lol. Yes! I've seen people not using a second cleanser at all but my oily skin could never. I just got the Hada Labo cleansing oil as well!  Couldn‚Äôt justify spending almost $30 on DHC‚Äî super happy I found this one instead! I have the same question for OP. I'm in Canada and Amazon hasn't got squat for me. Oof I'm super bad with drinking enough water daily üò• I love it! Amazing at getting makeup off and immediately washed off with water to leave my skin feeling totally clean but not right or dry. I honestly think you could use it alone, but my oily skin paranoia makes me follow up with some cetaphil cleanserüòÇ I didnt like it, it made me breakout even when I did a second cleanse. I think because it's olive oil based? Idk I think it's pretty nice but I don't really have strong opinions on oil cleansers as I haven't found one that really wow me. It gets the job done and is affordable. It is olive-oil-based which I read is better for dry skin rather than oily skin (which I am). I still am really enjoying it but I'll be switching to a diff one when this runs out. I bought the oil cleanser & spot treatment towards the end of last year. I only need a small amt per use so they last a long time. I have a couple bottles and really hate the white cast and piling it leaves me with. my skin is only a medium shade but the colour correcting properties of the sunscreen leave me a patchy, white, mess.  It might work for you if you‚Äôre very fair I suppose. It is kind of tricky to work with if your skin isn't fair but I like the end result too much so I finessed the application process for it lol. I have the lavender ver (pretty sure they have a green ver too) and use it to neutralize yellow undertones to brighten the complexion. It will be patchy if you don't apply in small amounts at a time and don't use an adequate amt of moisturizer. It's pretty nice. The feeling is just like vaseline. I love the scent and the shade. It keeps my lips hydrated well enough I only need to reapply twice a day. I got most of these through stylevana. The lip balm was from my local sephora. I got my first tube when visiting jp and ordered my second online after coming back to the states. Thank you! It leaves a whitecast if you're not fair. Otherwise, it works quite well. Copying my reply to another comment: I have the lavender ver (pretty sure they have a green ver too) and use it to neutralize yellow undertones to brighten the complexion. It is kind of tricky to work with if your skin isn't fair but I like the end result too much so I finessed the application process for it lol. It will be patchy if you don't apply in small amounts at a time and don't use an adequate amt of moisturizer. It works well in both situations you described. I put a small amount on any place with a pimple/tentative pimple as the last step of my night routine. I‚Äôm sorry to have to be the one to teach you basic human decency, but people with little money deserve nice things too. This blame-the-poor mentality is unhelpful and frankly useless. Additionally, it isn‚Äôt as if OP went out and bought everything at once. Gauging by the different levels of use of each product, they accumulated their collection over some time. ....what I do/did own a few the ordinary products but a lot of them pill underneath my sunscreen (not even makeup!). Also the texture of some is just horrible to work it. Some worked and some didn't but if I have to suffer for skincare I don't want it. (The famous red BHA+AHA mask stings my skin like no other yikes!) The dropper-bottle products I have are only a few dollars more expensive I think they're a better investment. Because there's more than one brand? If it makes you feel any better... Supposedly the new GOP version of the stimulus addresses adult dependents, so this time you should get your check (assuming you qualify, not sure if it will retroactively qualify though). You can have him redo taxes (change file form) so you can then claim the money. More money is expected to come our way so prob worth it. Ask r/taxes how best to proceed. Not an accountant so follow their advice over me pls! If your dad got the $500 child credit then you should be 16 or under which means you're a dependent either way. Your dad can‚Äôt just decide to claim you or not, there‚Äôs a bunch of criteria that determines whether you are a dependent or not. Did your parents provide over 50% of your expenses during the year? he got the $500? i thought that was for 16 and under only. i was claimed as a dependent (im 18) and we got $0 lol. Sounds like you‚Äôre a really great parent to him. My mother claimed me all throughout college even though I lived on my own for 6 years AND she kept the money from my loan credits even though I paid every cent of my university‚Äôs fees. Ugh :( Oh me too! It kinda sucks. So my derm said topically it shouldn‚Äôt cause resistance like  antibiotics do by mouth, but that to mitigate any side effects clindamycin topical solution should be used with benzoyl peroxide. Hi. So the first tube I've ever used was purchased on my trip to jp. I loved it so much but didn't need a new one until around a year later. My second tube was purchased [here](https://www.beyoungandbeauty.com/product-page/dalacin-t-gel-1-10g-10tubes). I saw that it works the same as the first one so I didn't really think much about it but as some commenters pointed out, it's a [prescription antibiotic](https://www.myvmc.com/drugs/dalacin-t-topical-lotion/) (I first got it over the counter however). Please do evaluate the pros and cons before use! Not op, but I have tried both the DHC and the Hada Labo cleansing oils. I would say that the DHC is slightly thicker than the Hada Labo. Both are great for cleansing but I would say that the DHC does a better job at removing waterproof makeup. I've only used it once when I was sleeping over at a friend's house. From what I remember it has a smell while the Hada Labo doesn't. The feeling is pretty much the same. I also don't wear wp mascara so I am of no help there unfortunately. Lab muffin has a pretty good [article/video](https://labmuffin.com/chemical-vs-physical-sunscreens-the-science-with-video/) on this topic. It's basically the type of UV filter used in the product that categorize the sunscreen. That's the Roundlab Dokdo Lotion It helps reduce skin redness?  May I ask how she uses it for that purpose?  I feel like I'm constantly battling redness in my skin. That‚Äôs cool! Never knew that Awesome thanks! I use the same cleansing oil too! the best part is its refillable, so theres no need to rebuy the entire pump :) I never liked the DHC one. It was meh to me. I do like the Kose Speedy Cleansing Oil the best. I use the Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion for my Hyaluronic Acid which I cannot live without. I‚Äôd have to look into this cleansing oil! [removed] Just a headsup that the mint one doesn't have a strong whitecast compared to the lavender one! Awesome I'll look for it thanks! I agree, but I also dont go around saying Im broke while Im buying things. If youve ever had to live check to check, like I have, than you know what being broke is and what it involves. [deleted] yes. but they‚Äôre expensive. all that money goes into marketing, expensive bottles and shit and absurd profit margins. why would you buy anything else? Damn I hope that‚Äôs true Did that actually go through?? Huh interesting! Good to know Oh, Im not under 16. So i guess he didn‚Äôt get the credit? Idk he mentioned some sort of credit. Maybe since I‚Äôm a student? No clue. Like I said, I don‚Äôt understand taxes. Nah I‚Äôm 22 so there‚Äôs no way he got it. This was before any of us filed so maybe he was confused on the credit? Idk dude There‚Äôs some shitty, entitled parents out there Me three D: Well I think the side effect to watch out for is resistance in the bacteria on your face haha, but it probably takes a while to happen topically. But yes benzoyl peroxide mitigates that, which is why clindamycin is often in combination medications that also contain it. Apparently Azelaic acid also works similarly to mitigate antibiotic resistance, and I like AA way better than benzoyl because it's not drying for me and has way more benefits. Overall I like clindamycin way better than benzoyl peroxide for antibacterial work just because you never stop getting dried out from BPO, and there's a tiny reason to suggest that it can drive aging long term because of how it works. thank you so much! out of curiosity do u truly have to use it twice a day to be effective or do u just use it as a spot treatment when pimples appear Ooh!!! Now I feel silly üôÉ thank you for your answer üíï Yea she just uses it in her serum step morning and night. Although she did say that it's weaker/less effective than products with cica/centella. I've seen a lot of people (including her) seeing better results using centella serums/cica balms. If I have to make a recommendation, I'd suggest looking into those type of products first before the calamine one. Not OP but the 'SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampoule' has helped loooooads with my redness. About $20 bucks on Amazon or Yesstyle. >Hada Labo Gokujun Cleansing Oil

Wow I didn't know they sold a refill, great to know! I just started using it and this makes me love it even more! I agree with you. I bought the DHC one because I heard so many good things about it, but it was definitely meh for me as well. Can‚Äôt believe how much it costs. I‚Äôve seen the Kose speedy cleansing oil mentioned a few times now, so I‚Äôll definitely have to give it a go as well!  I‚Äôm right there with you about the Hada Labo HA lotion, my face would literally shrivel up like a raisin and die without it. üòÇ Guys this is a prescription treatment, I wouldn‚Äôt go purchasing it on random websites on the internet... It‚Äôs an antibiotic, too. Yes actually I HAVE had to live cheque to cheque, yet I still somehow understand that ‚Äúbroke‚Äù is a colloquialism that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the person using the term is destitute. OP was showing their shelfie...it's super pateronizing to assume you know better by designing a program for them from a brand that is, quite frankly, not for everyone. They're not all expensive, nor are people required to buy from all one brand. Plus, since they're cheap a lot of their products are crap, nor do they work for everyone. No, it hasn't gone through yet. That's just some of what's in the bill the GOP proposed, so I think it's pretty safe to assume we'll get another stimulus payment once the final bill is negotiated, since Democrats will want that too. No, because they tried to add a few billion on top for more military spending. It's a trash bill, it better not pass. It ends the moratorium on evictions among other things The form you're looking for is the 1040x . I don't understand it and probably filled it out wrong (I THOUGHT I was claimed as a dependent but was not), but can tell you the name of the form. Yeah, if the dependent was 17+ then they don‚Äôt get anything He probably got the regular credit on his taxes for having a dependent, but not the stimulus credit. to be fair, this whole situation has been handled very poorly, so i‚Äôm sure everyone is at least a little confused. 1,200 USD would have covered the fee to go home early and cancel the old plane ticket. I never use my spot treatments in the morning and on non-pimple areas Thanks so much, will take a look! Ah, didn't realize!
Thanks for confirming. Well if you could afford luxury items, which is what skin care is, then you shouldn't complain about money. The money spent on skin care could go to bills, food, gas, things that you actually need. non sequitur. just because somethings cheap, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad. as i say, they strip back the huge amounts of money spent on marketing, and have much smaller profit margins, hence the low price.

you don‚Äôt have to buy from them. your choice. but they deliver the same ingredients for a lot cheaper. yall just don‚Äôt wanna hear it. Haha thank you! Taxes are so confusing thank u so much for ur help! i really appreciate it :) No problem :) I hope you can get it from a doctor! You do understand that first of all, the ordinary requires atleast a basic understanding of skincare as almost ALL of their products have some type of active ingredient, which some people like me who have incredibly irritable skin can NOT handle.   


And also, that there is a big difference between having the same ingredients, and have the same formulations. 2 products can both have 10% glycolic acid, but that doesn't mean the formulations will be the same as 1 of the products might have a thicker consistency and the other could be more irritating because it isn't formulated with soothing ingredients etc.   
Why do you think there's so many AHA, BHA, niacinamide toners and serums out there all with the same % of the active ingredient but 1 of them can destroy your skin whilst the other doesn't.   


How can you even think every other brand on the planet is expensive when there are brands like COSRX that are incredibly cheap and offer very good formulations that do NOT pill up often unlike the ordinary, and 1 moisturizer can last literally 6+ months for 24 bucks? clearly that's a YOU issue, get off your ignorant high horse just because 1 brand helped you.   


There is not 1 brand in the entire world that will ever be able to cater to every persons skin, because every person has preferences, sensitivities, allergies and more that are different and will always have different needs.   


Also anyone who uses the ordinary and has ever tried it knows that the brand is notorious for MANY of their products pilling on the skin, their niacinamide serum broke me out and pilled like crazy even when mixed within my moisturizer (which is something many people do to stop the pilling), and my sister uses their Vit C serum 30% in silicone and that also pills like crazy. Is it cheaper? Yes. Does that mean the FORMULATION is good? No. Does that mean everyone needs a brand that very heavily uses active ingredients and is not something everyone needs? No.   


Sorry if I sound condescending, but if you go around acting passive agressive towards everybody else calling you out for the fact that you're wrong, don't expect the sweetest replies back. Skin is something personal, don't dictate what others need for their skin, because unlike you not everyone can easily find products that work for their skin. Ohhhh you're a teenager and think everything is an absolute. Got it. It's not. My accountant told me that if you didnt get the stimulus this year you get a credit that you can claim next tax season and get the money. Im assuming it will work with both stimulus checks. what do you even mean by that my guy. also congrats on your feeling of superiority due to being born earlier than someone else. Oh I do remember my dad mentioning that as a possibility I‚Äôd love to know more about that. I filed taxes as an independent in the beginning of June but was a de pendant the prior year. I still haven‚Äôt gotten anything but my friend got theirs before my taxes were even filed I mean that you can't understand why people would buy from other brands when there's literally millions of reasons. Yes my accountant said it will work if you wrre a dependent the prior tax season. i have this as well and it's honestly a godsend, it definitely regulates my skin sebum but i also notice my skin looks more toned and even!!! I wanted to love this so bad and it broke me out. Thought it might just be that product so tried a couple of different products with niacinamide and they all either broke me out or caused dry patches. So weird because my skin isn‚Äôt usually sensitive at all. Sad though, I really wanted to like it! this stuff + their azelaic acid makes my cupid butt's red cheeks so evenly toned :') it only took about a month too!

will say though, for some reason it makes my skin really... shiny? like not oily, the skin is taut and there's no tangible sebum, but immediately after putting it on it's like my forehead becomes a polished surface. not sure if anyone else has had this experience, but it kinda sucks looking so shiny in the morning D: If you have any b&a pics please share!! I tried to find a everyday routine for me recently and this main ingredient helped my skin so much! 

My daily routine looks like this now: 
- I was my face with Paula's Choice Skin Recovery Cream Cleanser or just water.
- Then j use just some vitamin eye cream
- I mix this ordinary serum with my CeraVe Moisturizer
- Sometimes I use other products if needed (seem prescribed)

That's it ! This was the first product I ever bought from The Ordinary and it totally changed my skin for the better!! 

My pores were huge and my forehead and chin were COVERED in ‚Äúunder the skin‚Äù pimples (idk if there‚Äôs a technical term for it lol).  I used it every night and my skin cleared up within 2 weeks. Now I use it every other night alternating with their buffet serum :) My skin has literally never been clearer.  Praise be to the ordinary gods. I have been struggling from acne on my chin for majorit of my life. This is product completely cleared it up for me and for the first time in over 10 years I have close to clear skin. I have incredibly sensitive skin too but works amazingly. I think it is due to the fact that I follow TO regime quite to the T and use a combination of their products. I think they all help each other. I use Cerave Pm lotion and Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream (both feature niacinamide) daily with no issues, yet this serum gave me some of the worst breakouts / irritation that I have ever experienced from a product. Big, painful red cysts / whiteheads. Very sad because I wanted to love it!! Aww I broke out with this product. I'm super sad cause everyone's been raving about this. Anyone else experience inconsistencies in the formula? My first bottle was kind of spicy/tingly and worked wonderfully... so I bought two more (~ 1 year ago) and they were totally different. Felt like nothing at all, smelled like nothing at all, did nothing at all... except for cause some clogged pores? PSA - 10% might be too strong for some (like me!) Unfortunately TO don't make a 5% but check the wiki for some alternatives that contain 5% or less :) I feel like the only one in this sub without strong feelings about this product. Ive been using it for over 2 months now and while I don't notice any huge differences in pigmentation or anyrhing else, I do really like how it regulates sebum production but I could also live without it. I will still repurchase because I do have really oily skin and this does help a bit in controlling it throughout the day, but for me its definitely not a HG product like so many others find. Just picked up my 2nd bottle I just bought this and it hasn‚Äôt done anything for me redness ( vit c has saved me there) but I do notice I‚Äôve started getting blackheads since using it. Ended up having to cleanse in the morning instead of just water cleansing to try reduce it. That stuff is gold! I use it for my breakouts and take a zinc tablet with dinner. Works like a charm. I have a bit of redness, not too much. Skin is normal to dry. Would this be ok on skin ? I'm also mid 40s I know this obviously worked for you, but I'd caution against using this if you have rosacea or sensitive skin. Even though my skin usually isn't particularly sensitive, I found my face stung like crazy and felt so incredibly uncomfortable using this. The strange thing is my first bottle wasn't really irritating, so I have no idea why the second bottle started to irritate the hell out of my skin. 

It also pills like craaaaaazy with absolutely everything I've ever tried it with. I could only apply it at night because of that (and it still messed up my minimal evening routine). this is amazing! it made my skin dry when i used it alone so i mixed it with moisturizer and it reduced the appearance of my pores. I've been using a routine with the ordinary products for a while now and at first my skin was doing really well but it's gone back to how it was/worse than it was before and I'm gutted Yes! It helped me with the same issues. Mixing this with moisturizer really helped for me it was too strong by itself i never thought of using this for my redness! i bought it initially to reduce my pores in my t zone, and it worked great. in just 2 months i could already see a visible difference, and now 5 months after i started using it, my pores are so much better off!! This stuff saved my skin too! I could tell an immediate difference in my PIH. Niacinamide is great but it depends on where your skin is at. I really like Liquid Gold, and also the ELF supercleanse niacinamide products. Too avoid the pilling i mix 2 drops wit my moisturizer and it just glides on Niacinamide gives me rosacea instead of curing it. I get red hot flushes from this. I can manage small concentrations, but this serum makes red. I REALLY wanted to love this, but unfortunately it causes my face to break out in hives. I‚Äôve had really bad luck with all of TO products that I‚Äôve tried‚Äîbut I‚Äôm glad they are working for others! This is also one of my favorite products. It made such a difference in my skin. I'm so glad my skin loved this! I recommended this to my friends but almost all of them had a break out after trying. It's just not for everyone I guess. This broke my skin out. Suprisingly, Glossier's equivalent works how I assume TO's was meant to.

It's the only Glossier product I purchase. If TO's version breaks you out--I assume my skin is sensitive to the high Niacinamide concentration?--then try out Super Clear. Sadly is super expensive like most Glossier products. So I now use Olay's serum for my Niacinamide treatment. This is my first TO product, but it's still too early to say whether my skin is benefiting from it. Anyway, can I still use spot treatments for acne with this? I have a tea tree oil + zinc lactate gel for breakouts, and I was wondering where it would fit into my routine. Or could I skip the spot treatment since I'm already using this? I don‚Äôt have rosacea, but I‚Äôve been using this product almost every night for two weeks now. My goal is to make dark spots from acne fade. I think I‚Äôve noticed a slight improvement, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure that I‚Äôm not imagining it. I know skincare can take a while to work, so I‚Äôm going to keep using it. I hear so many good things about it.

By the way, does anyone know if you‚Äôre it‚Äôs fine to apply this after TO‚Äôs glycolic acid toner? I‚Äôm going to start using that product tomorrow. Saved my wife skin tooüòç I just started using this product three days ago and I‚Äôm amazed at how much of a difference it made for me. I have sensitive skin with characteristics of rosacea and am prone to fungal acne and this product has made my skin significantly smoother and less red/irritated without causing a acne flare. I tried it for two months and I didn't see any difference :( Is this good for oily skin? If i were stranded on a desert island and could only have 5 things with me, this would be one of them. This shit gives me LIFE. My skin has never looked better. I've had closed comedones, red dots and bumps on my chest my entire life, always worse in the summer. Pharmacists have said it's heat rash (even when it's cold) or sun allergy (even though my chest is covered up 99% of the time -- I wear a scarf to hide my skin).

This product literally changed everything nearly overnight for me. If I stop using it, after quite a few weeks the bumps return, but they always disappear within 48 hours of using it. 

I found that once I significantly reduced how much I was using -- thanks to someone in this sub pointing out that you need way less than you think -- it stopped pilling. Glad this worked for you! Type 1&2 rosacea here and this broke me out terribly. I think it was too harsh for my skin, so those interested in trying it, proceed with caution! [deleted] My HG! this didn't do anything for me. but stop using soap/cleanser worked great! Using this now! My skin has been much better and haven't had any issues with break outs so long as I don't skip my morning/night routine (which I do here and there). Made my skin soft after using it consistently for a few days. I love the serum but when my dermatitis got bad these last three months, I find that I need it in much more concentration to rebuild my moisture barrier. These three weeks I've switched to using powdered Niacinamide which is more cost-effective in a long run. I don't have rosacia but I do have facial redness and my skin loves this and it's so much less red when I use it regularly. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have some of this lying around somewhere. This breaks me out and also flares my redness up sometimes üò© 

Just shows how skin is so particular This stuff is incredible on my combo acne prone skin. OTOH, Theo vitamin c in silicone and HA cream totally broke me out. Same! This helped so much with my redness and my large pores. Honestly a Godsend. I was using this fine on my forehead/nose but when I switched to my cheeks and chin I think it was starting to cause a breakout. I may try mixing a drop with my moisturizer and see how that goes. May be too strong for me on its own. I suggest mixing this with something else. You‚Äôll get less breakouts. I mix mine with squalane and/or hyaluronic acid serum :) I‚Äôm in love with this product! So good for PIE! This is my go-to for my oily skin. Has anyone used this, it worked amazing for a few months and then BAM it starts clogging pores like crazy? It was HEAVEN when I started using it. Cleared skin, kept acne at bay, but then it started to turn on me! Started using this a week ago today and my skin is the clearest it‚Äôs been in about a year. 95% of my acne is healed (just red marks). Hope it continues this way!! This isn‚Äôt helping my redness at all :( I'm an esthetician and I think this product is a godsend. I always recommend it to my clients who are looking for redness/blemish control! I use it on my own skin in my daily routine (fair skinned, previously had blemishes around cheekbones) and I began seeing results in not even two weeks. Definitely not a product for everyone. My skin hates nacinamide with a passion. I tried this and woke up with 4 cysts all over my face. I wasn't sure if it was TO formulation so I wound up trying Wander Beauty Glow Ahead Illuminating Face Oil. Three and a half weeks. Three and a half weeks of my face erupting in whiteheads, after using it ONCE and for only about 6 hours. I had closed comedones, whiteheads, and bumpy skin. I won't even look at anything with niacinamide in it anymore. Does this work on hyperpigmentation? I've been trying this for 3 weeks now and it won't stop breaking me out. At first I thought it was purging but now I'm not so sure :( I stopped because I can't handle how bad my skin has gotten now I'm hoping that my skin doesnt hate this. I just got it and tried it and my skin broke out terribly, but i was also incredibly dehydrated and ate garbage so I cant pinpoint my issues on just this. Gonna keep playing to find out. Fingers crossed! Happy for you but niacinamide is terrible for me, breaks me out into itchy red spots. NOPE NOPE NOPE. It's in so many products, it's awful. I was using it at night but my face started getting really dry. I thinks it‚Äôs because my dumb self was just putting it on at night after cleansing and not putting my cerave cream on after. I might try to use it again and just mix it in with my lotion. this post literally just read my to do list. op you just confirmed more to me that i need to buy this product. Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely look into this! I love this so much, not only has it helped my acne a lot but I use this under my makeup and I haven‚Äôt used actual primer since!!! My makeup stays on better now than it did with primer!! Yes!! I absolutely love this. I used to use it AM, but I realised it was pilling a lot, making my make up look really weird, so I only use it PM now. It is life-saviour! <3 Yes!!!! I love this Niacinamide! Wow that looks super great for Rosacea, I'll check it out! I‚Äôve been using tretinoin for 6 months at night, which could have something to do with my extreme reaction, idk. So just a warning if you‚Äôre considering mixing the two. 

I added this serum to my morning routine after hearing great things, and it MURDERED my skin.
My eyelids were burning, the skin around my chin and mouth was red and flaking off. 

I went to the dermatologist 3 days after starting using this serum and she was horrified.  Prescribed me some hydrocortisone and told me to stop using this. Wanted to love this product. It did nothing for me though. I finished the entire bottle but it did nothing for my skin at all. Trying rosiver/soolantra now and hoping for a miracle! Thank you for the recommendation. I saw this exactly when I needed it. I have suspected for a long time I have rosacea and it‚Äôs finally obvious to me. Tired of hiding behind make up so I‚Äôm ready to do something about it! Purchasing this now :) TO's niacinamide helps make my face [shiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4tHk5TeE9E) (ignore the content, it's just the one video I have that shows what niacinamide did to me). I like it. But since moving cities, it seems to have lost its effect on me. Something in the air maybe, idk. I have rosacea and recently ordered it (including a few other TO stuff) because I generally love niacinamide. Can't wait to try it after patch testing! I used this before but all it did for me was reduce my large pores. :( Did this tingle at all? I just purchased this earlier today! I‚Äôm excited to try it. Yes! I just got this for the first time last week! After a week of use, I am loving it. I‚Äôm not sure if I have rosacea or just sun damage, but I definitely have splotches of redness on my face and I can already see it evening out my skin tone. No issues with irritation or break outs. Is there any permanent cure for rosacea or is it just continue using products for it forever? I've had mine for over a decade now and I'm just wondering if there's any escape from being dependent on treating it all the time. anyone have any luck with this for acne ? I like niacinimide a lot but this RUINED my skin haha... didnt believe that this was the cause and kept using it for ages... now my otherwise usually clear skin has MORE redness from scars. Sadly, this is a big big miss from me and my rosacea haha..

really really wanted to love it for the simplicity and cost : ) I've used this for 3 weeks now and the appearance of my pores has minimized. I use just a pea size every morning and night. It sucks that some people breakout from it because it actually gets rid of my occasional cystic acne while used in combination with the AHA 30% peel they have. I also use their 2% retinoid emulsion+LAA powder+caffeine solution+hemi squalane. They are ALL amazing. Retinoid and the LAA powder have improved my skin texture and acne scars. The caffeine solution actually depuffs my eyes I can see the difference! The hemi squalane is the one that's listed as oil free. I confirmed with DECIEM via email that it's non comedogenic. It does a perfect job keeping moisture in while not causing breakout. Their products are really godsend lol It helps they are priced very reasonably so it doesn't hurt trying them out. I got this and I have absolutely no idea what all the love for this is. It dried my skin out SO bad! All around the edge of my lips were raw and peeling like I had been sunburnt. I wonder why so many says this product pills. Been using it for a year and never had I experienced "pilling" at all.

I use it after toner /essence when my skin still feels damp, wait 1 minute then continue with moisturizer. Always absorbs and spreads fine.

I hate the smell tho, still bearable but hate it. Same! Holy graiiiiiiil in my skincare routine What is also miraculous about this product is combining it with Salicylic acid for treatment of inflammed cystic acne they really vanish in no time. This makes me break out so bad. Which is weird because I use other products with niacinamide and my skin is fine. Unless it‚Äôs the zinc, I‚Äôm not sure ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è When I first used this, I broke out (not sure if from this, or one of the other two TO products I started using at the same time) and didn't see what the hype was about so I stopped it.

Picked it up again last week and am loving it now. My face is so smooth and it honestly helped with some breakouts I was having. Pores look a bit smaller, too. I've been using a small amount in the morning, and a "normal" amount at night. I used it for some time for my greasy skin and big pores but didn't noticed any changes.i see a lot of people saying it's wonderful, I don't get it :( Where can I get this other than Amazon? I feel like this is totally the reason why my little sebaceous filaments have gone away! This thing irritates my skin. :-( This works for PIE? Yes, this is what I want so much! 32, sensitive, acne prone skin, this saved me from embarrassing back acne. This is godsend, since my teenage years I suffered from back acne which really messed with my self esteem. It this point I tried everything short of accutane, which my doctor refused to prescribe, within a couple of weeks I stopped getting breakouts and it visibly faded my existing scars. I can't say how glad I am that this serum exists 
Don't give up hope, there is a possible solution for all of us. Does this expire if not used for a long time ? Does anyone know if you can use this along with azaelic acid? I‚Äôve got oily skin and breakouts on my Tzone.

I purchased this and the [mario badescu Acne starter kit](https://images.ulta.com/is/image/Ulta/2507280) but have no idea how to implement TO into my routine , does anyone have any reccs? This product worsend my rosacea and caused me more acne. Where can I find this? I can definitely agree. This product worked really well for me. I am taking accutane now and it was super harsh on my skin while on accutane(don‚Äôt recommend). Off of accutane I could basically immediately feel the thin layer take off the first layers of my skin and it was great... their lactic acid is really good for cystic/bump textures too.. I would use their products like every two days or so since they are very strong Tbh I didn‚Äôt think this would work for me but because of the price won‚Äôt it was worth a shot and I will say it has really helped to reduce redness and calm those types of acne that are just forming! 

Curious how does everyone use this in their routine? Personally I put on some hyaluronic acid serum wait a bit then put this on and my cera ve moisturizer on top but just wondering if I should switch the order WHERE DO I BUY THIS?! sorry to seem dumb, but what is rosacea? This gives me all the CCs :( Wish i could love it WHERE DO I BUY THIS?! Does it help with roascea /red skin? Same! I had dermatillomania for years and still struggle not to pick/pinch, but after using this stuff the sebum deposits/bumps that had constantly tempted me have become few and far between. My pores are noticeably less...clogged, and my skin tone is generally more even, though  TO's Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% is def more effective for dark spots and stuff. I inherited rosacea from my dad - his is actually so severe he's on year-round antibiotics so it doesn't develop pustules. I just have really red cheeks - but this? This cleared my skin. Like no more super red cheeks! This stuff is a godsend! Same. Broke me out. But I hear good things about it. This also broke me out and I don't have sensitive skin! Hormonal acne-prone, but not sensitive and yet, the morning after I broke out so badly. Same with me, niacinamide just doesn't seem to do well with my skin. Though I remember a previous post mentioning niacinamide supplements helped their skin, that might be an option you wanna check out! Same. Also pills like crazy Ditto

But I tried other products with niacinamide and it didn‚Äôt have the same effect. I also have a cleanser with zinc in it that is fine, something about TO‚Äôs product that causes me issues. You perfectly described my experience with this product! My friend loved it and I wanted to love it too; I heard about all the wonderful things it could do, except all it did was broke me out Also broke me out! Tiny little bumps all over my face, ugh. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one. Try azelaic acid instead. I‚Äôve never heard of niacinamide helping rosacea actually. Same! I wanted so bad to love it since everyone raves about it. I was the idiot that bought it before a big work trip and didn't patch test. It was an awful week of trying to cover monster zits on my lip. Have you tried putting toner on after letting the serum absorb? My skin didn't react well either until I did this. My skin acts the same way with any product containing niacinamide. Similar to you, I figured it was specially The Ordinary formula. I went on to try 3 different niacinamide products (Skinlex, Shark Sauce, Stratia) and all caused breakouts/irritations/redness. Some people just can‚Äôt tolerate niacinamide and I highly recommend patch testing for at least a week. Many of the ordinary and other less expensive brands like good molecules that have niacin in them have chlorphenesin as a preservative. I'm definitely allergic to it and this gave mean dry patches. Same.  But azelaic acid wound up being my holy grail! Glad this worked for OP, though. Should look at Fourth Rays Niacinamide serum! I got it out of curiosity as I've liked all their other stuff. I too usually get a reaction to niacinamide products, lots of little bumps etc... But seriously the fourth Ray product has toned my redness down immensely! I love it. Same Same :-( Had the same problem. Are there any alternatives with similar effects? Same for me, I tried it so many times for all of the benefits of niacinamide, but it just kept clogging up my skin... Same with the 10% niacinamide from Facetheory.. When I first used it my skin was fine, but I took a break for about 6 months (too dry in the winter) and after that, I broke out every time I used it. For some reason, every TO product I have used so far has broke me out. So weird. Me too, I used it for nearly a year, phasing everything else in my routine in and out not thinking this could be the culprit and as soon as I stopped being an idiot and stopped using it all my horrible deep cheek spots cleared up. Still dealing with the scarring now Have you tried the Azealic Acid? It produces similar results to the nicinamide Omg! I thought it was just me..  my skin was getting better then I used this and boom I‚Äôm breaking out Me too. Ugh same. Niacinamide kills my skin! Me too It broke me out too =( Same, my face hated it. I get a rash from niacinamide! And it‚Äôs been getting super popular. It‚Äôs surprisingly hard to find a bb creme without it. Maybe you‚Äôre allergic? Maybe try Paula's Choice niacinamide booster. I love it & the TO broke me out as well :) i did notice the more even skin tone also my birthmarks color is actually lighter now. My boyfriend said that and i was shook. I'm getting it removed soon anyway so i don't pay attention to it but he notices things i'd never see myself. Have you tried it recently? The first version was awful for me - I love the current formulation (I think there have been three?). Hit or miss depends on the person. Amazon review are much the same either it's a "godsend"or it a "DO NOT BUY" I usually apply moisturizer after it and I think that helps a lot against dryness Have you tried TO azelaic acid instead? I have an allergy to niacin and even though it‚Äôs not really related to niacinamide, I find niacinamide causes me itchy and inflamed skin. :( I want to love it but I can‚Äôt! I have to be careful of which products I buy, too, making sure it doesn‚Äôt include it as an ingredient. I feel like my mom would love it though. Me too Maybe purging?? I‚Äôve had the same issue with one of the ordinary products I just got, I‚Äôm trying to hold out to see if it‚Äôs just my skin purging the junk. It had 5 stars üò≠ Yeah, this broke me out pretty bad within two days of use. I gave it away. I was so disappointed, because I heard great things about it. I used the whole bottle up and it did absolutely nothing except cause some dryness which is expected. Don't waste your money. Niacinamide helps the cells so one can get breakouts from it the first couple of weeks Now that I think about it... Maybe you guys bought a fake? There is a lot of fake TO products, especially the niacinamide one. It does me too, but I like that shiny dewy look. It makes my skin look healthy. Me too, so I started using it at night instead I‚Äôm always curious what people‚Äôs skin is like when using products. I‚Äôm new to this sub, but it doesn‚Äôt seem common to list skin type... kind of odd?

I‚Äôm oily and have been looking to figure out how to stop blotting several times a day and just started on TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% a week ago, PM only in case I had a reaction to it. The shininess has been the only strange thing and is the reason I‚Äôm not using it in the AM. Mine doesn‚Äôt pill like some have said, no redness, or stinging but it leaves me so shiny I look almost like I‚Äôm sweating. The effect doesn‚Äôt go away until I wash it off. How do you use the two products? Which one goes first and how much do you wait between? I have both but haven‚Äôt figure it out how to use them together. I've been using TO azelaic acid for about 2 weeks now in an attempt to get rid of my PIE. If you don't mind my asking, did you purge while using it? Can you use this and the azelaic acid at the same time? If so which do you apply first? what azelaic acid product do you use? I use this at night instead of in the AM! I noticed the shininess too! This what I got my BF on, I don‚Äôt even think I have a picture of his skin before me, because after about a month or two of seeing each other I got him on a skin care routine.

I recommend this combo to everyone! Keeps the skin looking noice I miss the azelaic acid. Canada made it RX-only so I can't get it easily now and to be honest haven't bothered to try to find a derm yet. Only other option would be to pop across the border, buy and bring it back (this is allowed for personal cosmetic use) but alas I don't live in a border city. You don't get pilling? That made me unable to keep using it. I'm confused whether I'm using this right. I use it at night after my shower. I usually use, in order, toner -> niacinamide -> moisturizer -> benzoyl peroxide

Should I apply moisturizer first before niacinamide? What type of issues did you have that this helped with? May I please ask which CeraVe moisturizer you use specifically? I mix this with my CeraVe too!!! (The am moisturizer with spf). I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get it in my routine without causing pilling and this has been the best solution. LOVE this stuff. This works really well mixed with Cerave I noticed After how long did you start seeing some visual improvements in your skin? I just started it about a week ago and while I feel like it‚Äôs helping, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of blackheads all over my face (whereas I‚Äôd never get them before)! Did your skin purge with it at all? Closed comedowns! May I ask how many drops you put on your face? Hail Lord Inary üôè Would you mind sharing what else you use? I‚Äôm super curious! i really wonder what in this product causes such adverse reactions for people. whenever i see it mentioned, its either reviews like yours or the kind calling it a "*godsend*". pretty tempted to try it but i'm actually scared to haha I find that 10% is just too strong for me. It seems I'm not the only one and that there have been studies to show that anything over 5% just increases the risk of irritation. Hence why you get on fine with the cerave as it is around 5% :) Yes!! Same here. One of my bottle's contents separated, and it had this thick white later on top. I'd never opened it and I was too wary to use it, so it's just sitting in my cabinet :( They constantly update their formula and don't really tell anyone. But I don't know for sure, definitely ask them if you are curious! They are usually good with replies. I feel like I had the total opposite in the sense that mine didn't smell and didn't tingle but WORKED WONDERS and then I bought a new bottle and it was tingly and gave me bad CCs. Now that I think about it, the 1st bottle came from Sephora US and the second from Sephora Canada so I wonder if that's relevant? TO's products are very much presented as being "ingredients" rather than necessarily just used "as-is" although of course why not. If you want to reduce the strength of this you could just mix it with their amino acids or hyaluronic acid+b5. I‚Äôve had the same experience. It hasn‚Äôt really done much for my active acne or my scarring (though some of my scarring is deeply pitted and I realize it won‚Äôt work there) but it has really helped with my general oilyness. Oh gosh I‚Äôve been using it for about a week and have a ton of blackheads (and I usually never have them)!! I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs just a purging stage. (Also I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre supposed to mix niacimide and  vitamin c by the way, if you were). Hope your blackheads have since cleared up! :) Do you always take zinc or just when you have a breakout? Could you tell us more about the zinc tablets? Like what dose, how often you take it, and how does it help? You could try this or their Azelaic acid. For me, I use this product to regulate sebum/oiliness and decrease breakouts. I have noticed some decreased redness to my face as well, but I think the Azelaic acid is more specifically for the redness. Either way, they are very cheap so I would get both and do a trial of each to see what works best! 49/f here. I use buffet and ascorbyl 12% daily and azelaic acid when my redness starts getting out of hand (i.e., SUMMER). I use hemi-squalane for daily moisturizer. At night I use lactic acid 5% and hada labo hyaluronic, and alpha lipoic once a week. 

The best thing I‚Äôve found for older skin is to only cleanse your face once a day after age 35. Any more is total overkill. I use a Face Halo or micellar, never ever ever cleanser. It‚Äôs absolutely the devil and worst product ever generally once your skin is not an oil put anymore. Just don‚Äôt do it. > but I'd caution against using this if you have rosacea or sensitive skin

Seconded. The evidence that niacinamide can help with *rosacea* is a bit... wobbly, and *most* of what I've personally seen has been related to niacinamide helping to repair a damaged moisture barrier, which then in turn helped improve the rosacea (put another way, the niacinamide didn't help rosacea *directly* but helped repair damaged skin that was *exacerbating* rosacea that would otherwise not have been as severe). My dermatologist never mentioned anything about niacinamide helping with rosacea, though we've talked about the ingredient more than once. Assuming OP does indeed have rosacea and not "just" (not to make light of a problem) redness (the two not being the same thing), and the niacinamide did *directly* help, that's awesome, but that's not necessarily going to be true for rosaceans in general. I understand! In the beginning if actually dryed up my skin badly. But mixing it with a bit of moisturizer helped me loads. How long did it take them to get break outs? I started a week ago and am getting black heads haha I‚Äôm curious about the routine as well. I wanted to throw azelaic acid in my routine too and I thiiiiink they all go fine together but just have an increased chance to irritate skin? That's exactly what I do at night- wash, glycolic, niacinamide, moisturizer  It's ok to use with the Toner, but if your skin isn't used to acids I would start slow with the Toner and only use it every couple of days and not apply the niacinamide after since your skin probably isnt fully used to it after only 2 weeks... just start slow and only moisturize well after the toner. >For people having issues with pilling, you may be using too much. I use about 4 drops before my moisturizer and I‚Äôve had no issues.


I use 4 drops as well, I rub it on with my hands and then use my rose quartz roller to really sink it in. Then I wait a few minutes before I moisturize (Laneige Water Bank Hydro Essence in the AM and Water Bank Moisture Cream in the PM). Never had an issue with pilling. Oh I'm so sorry you have a bad experience with it :( Is that all?? I‚Äôd kill for that! Hahaha Same. It didn't do much for my redness. I  have been using it for about a month now and no tingling. Just make sure whatever you used before dry on your face. From what I've learned there is no permanent solution... Unless you do laser therapy I think... Yes! I had some and it helps me with it! Try putting a smaller amount and mix it with your normal moisturizer! sephora stocks this brand now. I think so. Usually all creams have a certain date. Yes! But warning... It drys out the skin. On bad days I usually use a little bit of both. On the ordinary website (: Amazon!! It definitely helped me with it Hey this post came at the right time for me! I've been looking for something to help with redness. The tip of my nose is always red and get random patches as well. I also have hyperpigmentation mostly from acne and some acne still. I forget why but I had decided The Ordinary azelaic acid was the best bet for all this. What do you reckon in my case, azelaic acid or niacinamide? Has your dad tried it? I had the same problem until I read a comment from someone on r/skincareaddiction I think that said too much product would cause you to breakout worse. I cut down the amount of product I was using and now it‚Äôs the exact holy grail every one was talking about. I also use the Glycolic Acid Toner treatment before hand. Same skin type and same reaction. Weirdly, TO Niacinamide doesn't pill at all on my skin anymore. It used to pill like crazy, but with great benefits, so I stuck with it. Latest bottle from TO, zero pilling. Weird Ohhh that's like my product pet peeve. I can't stand products that do that, even if there's nothing else wrong with them. So you are the one who took my username! Sorry, what does it mean when a product "pills"? It's super annoying. Only way I've found to make it not pill is to apply it on dry, cleansed skin, let it dry completely and *then* wait 5 extra minutes or so before applying your moisturiser/oils.

And *even then* it'll still pill a little bit on a bad day. Yeah, I‚Äôve noticed that! It has helped my skin though so I put up with it. Same. It sucks :( I just bought the PC.  Where do you put it in your routine? Purging should only happen with acids/retinoids, otherwise it's not purging but a breakout, IIRC. [deleted] Niacinamide isn't an ingredient that can cause purging (unlike BHA, AHA, tretinoin, etc which absolutely can). If it's causing acne/zits, it's just a break-out, unfortunately. I purchased mine from the deciem store so nope wasn‚Äôt a fake. I highly doubt this many people purchased fake TO. Why would so many people be buying TO from sketchy resellers when you can easily get it from TO, Sephora and Ulta for like $5? Lol. I have pock marked skin but even this makes me glow! I get compliments when I am consistent on my routine. oh, i think some people just forget to talk about their skin type for context. i've never been prompted to lol, so here it is (have always wanted to do this, so please bear with me - my apologies that it had to happen on your comment):

my skin is comparable to if you were standing in the middle of the kitchen at burger king and you were emptying the french fry fryer of cooking oil at the end of the day. it is comparable to if you suddenly slipped and said "oh no" and dropped the vats of oil that were headed towards the trash. it is comparable to if the day-old used cooking oil spilled everywhere and suddenly everything was laden with grease. the pots. the pans. floors. drink machine. burger grill. cash register.

the burger king is covered in oil. and now you cannot move without *feeling* the grease, because it is everything. nothing is without oil anymore. and you are so painfully aware of every single little drop of oil that hangs suspended in the air. and you will never be able to shake this off of you, because it will never leave you. the oil is now part of you. my skin is comparable to that.

with that being said - yep, i tried using a mattifying sunscreen over it to no avail (ended up getting even oilier because the niacinamide isn't greasy and so my skin just dried up). i find the pilling comes if i use another heavier product under it, e.g. TO salicylic acid. but i do find the brightening effects to be apparent, and i have been using it AM/PM pretty consistently (will switch it out in the AM for melano cc vitamin C medicinal cream every other day or so). guess the blotting papers are here to stay... not at all :D i started using it to clear up both PIE and PIH and the results are definitely visible, i had some PIH around my nose mid august and now most of it is gone save two very old spots. this stuff definitely works yyoooo the TO azelaic acid! not only does it work well but my cheeks feel incredibly toned and smooth almost immediately after using it. makes it almost a shame to put sunscreen over it lol I don‚Äôt have pilling with this! It is the first product I use after washing my face (besides Thayers toner). Ive put various products on top of it, however, and the only product I had a slight patch of pilling with was my Australian gold tinted SPF. I found that the spot where it pilled, on my temples, is an area I tend to forget about when patting/rubbing the niacinamide into my skin.  So I think the niacinamide was just a bit too thick or not completely dried down in that spot when it pilled. What's pilling No, you're doing it right I developed Rosacea on my face, neck and chest/back. If was red, inflamed and I even had whiteheads from this as well. I've simplified my routine and found that this mixed with my moisturizer (once or twice a day) helps regulate face. Within a week! But I've been using it daily for a month and it still works wonders The serum has never caused me to break out but when I first started using it, it would dry down and kind of tighten my face, even if I put moisturizer on top. My skin eventually got used to it tho and I switched to a water based moisturizer which helped a lot! Usually 2-3 drops. I‚Äôve learned that less is more with this serum, and mixing it with the water based moisturizer on days where I want more helps keep my face from becoming clogged üôÇ Lmao love this Underrated comment No problem!! Here is my routine 

Morning:
Uriage Cleansing Foam (this is for makeup removal but I find it excellent even as a morning cleanser)

The Ordinary Zinc serum

Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel cream

The Ordinary Caffeine solution for eyes

Nivea Shine Control face sunscreen SPF50

Evening:
Uriage Cleansing Foam again (double cleanse)

Garnier Cleansing Water (for sensitive skin). I do about 1 swipe all over face just to make sure ALL makeup is off.

The Ordinary 7% toning solution

The Ordinary Caffeine solutions for eyes

Then I rotate the use of The Ordinary's Vitamin C 23% + HA spheres 2% OR The Orindary's Rosehip oil. So I will do 1 night Vitamin C and One night Rosehip. I do this as the Vitamin C is very potent for my sensitive skin. It seems like rotating keeps my skin happiest.


Then I do The Ordinary's AHA peeling solution once a week as general maintenance.


This seems to work well for my skin plus affordable. All these products are very reasonably priced. Could be a few things. Some people find they can't tolerate niacinamide in certain formulations but can in others; some are sensitive to pentylene glycol (or other glycols like propylene and/or butylene), ethoxydiglycol, or phenoxyethanol.

Re: niacinamide specifically, 10% is a *lot*. I've never seen any evidence >5% is more effective than 5% and it can be irritating, especially in use >5%. (A couple quick sources: "'[When used in high concentrations, it can cause skin irritation and redness](https://www.allure.com/story/niacinamide-skin-care-redness-side-effect),'" "['the scientific literature suggests 5% as optimal for achieving desired effects'" and she goes further to caution that higher concentrations may cause skin irritation.](https://www.cbc.ca/life/style/everything-you-need-to-know-about-using-niacinamide-on-your-skin-1.5056788)" Though, there's conflicting evidence as well: "[Clinical testing confirms that these ingredients [niacinamide and niacin] are not significant skin irritants, sensitizers or photosensitizers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16596767)." )

TL;DR: Skin's weird, dislikes certain things, some more than others. I would be scared to try it after all these reactions I've read, too, but for me... it's the one thing I'm using right now that I can literally tell from the texture of my face if I haven't used it for three days.  It has made my skin super baby smooth and I'm going to use it FOREVER. Omg same Zinc causes cysts in some. It also relieves acne and increases wound healing in some... so it‚Äôs a double edged sword. Maybe it‚Äôs a dose issue. I feel like I'm the weird one because it was completely neutral for my skin, it's like I didn't use anything whereas most people have those crazy reactions Maybe email them with a picture. It doesn't sound normal. Yeah I had the same thing happen with my most recent bottle Interesting! It‚Äôs so true that what‚Äôs best for some isn‚Äôt right for others, which makes it supremely frustrating if TO changes formulas often (I don‚Äôt know this as fact, but it was suggested upthread.) FWIW my bottles were all purchased directly from their website, shipped to US. Oh I don‚Äôt mix them, thank god. I use Vit C in the morning and Nia only at night. 

I was the same! Never had issues with blackheads before. I‚Äôve been using it for about 3 weeks and so far blackheads are the only ‚Äúreaction‚Äù I‚Äôve had. I just started cleansing in the morning and added a weekly mud mask into my routine and I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs helped. 

Hopefully it calms down and stops causing them or it‚Äôs not worth it for me. Hope your skin stops purging too! Zinc is not only great for immune health but it also evens out production of oils that your skin makes. I should be taking a 50 mg zinc tablet every day but generally I'll take one a day while using the ordinary if i get a breakout. Or if i feel like im getting sick zinc twice a day. (One in the morning and one at night) NEVER take them on an empty stomach, trust me on that. Thank you!! Very helpful That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking of doing. I keep reading conflicting things about using niacinamide and acids together, though. I do this + hyaluronic acid before moisturizing and my skin seems to really like it Oh man, I just submitted a post to the sub asking about this haha. The info I've seen advising against combining niacinamide and acids claims that their pH levels cancel each other out, so the products would be rendered useless. I just want to make sure before I unwittingly waste money doing that. On the plus side I'm starting Rosiver (Canada's Soolantra) today and I'm cautiously optimistic it'll help my rosacea! :) I just have to use very bland skincare products with it. lol Might have to look into that someday. That's exactly what I did; a drop in my nighttime moisturiser and I end up drier than a strong Retinol. Woah really??!

I bought stuff from the ordinary around November it last year...and I asked around in this sub and people told me i wouldn't have to worry about it

üò≠üò≠ Thank you!! I may try alternating if the dryness gets bad. So far I‚Äôve been using the Olay total sculpting micro cream for nighttime and my skins been loving it. It has niacinamide too so I thought maybe I would try TO‚Äôs for a more potent treatment! Omg. I‚Äôm an idiot.  Thank you Niacinamide + Zinc helps more with redness, and Azelaic Acid helps more with hyperpigmentation and spots. Together they're a wicked combo, I usually use both: Niacinamide morning & night, Azelaic Acid only at night (since it's light-sensitive and can pill a bit). As when starting any new product, spot-test each one independently, then start using one for about a week or two before introducing the other. No, but I need to recommend it. He has super sensitive skin though - like reactions to benozyl peroxide and other additives, so he might be hesitant. How much do you use now? I also broke out horribly from this. I use a lot of TO products. Mainly argan oil to remove makeup and as my every other day moisturizer. Should I use the niacinamide before moisturizing? After? Wait til moisturizer absorbs? The Gycolic Acid toner for sure broke me out. Which is funny because my skin loves the Mario Badescu one. I like to mix my niacinimide with Cosrx snail mucin since seeing it recommended here! I think both are supposed to help with redness too. Same for me! I wonder if it's just the strength of the product, because the Elta MD UV Clear sunscreen is my HG with 5% (I think?) Niacinamide. I wonder if they reformulated? It tended to pill bad when I put moisturizer on. I guess next time I‚Äôm at ulta I can sample it. Agreed.. it used to pill like crazy and I stopped using it in the mornings but recently it hasn't. I went back to a lighter moisturiser though so it may be that. I feel like the more regularly you use it the less likely to pill- so long as I use it every night I‚Äôm good it‚Äôs only if I forget to use it for a few days that it happens haha Same it makes me feel dirty. And I hate it on my pillow. Hehehehe Gets clumpy. Like bits of exfoliated dead skin on your arms and legs but in this case it‚Äôs the product creating that texture. Either with my serum or in my moisturiser daily :) Just don't mix with AHA/BHAs. That‚Äôs good to know!! I haven‚Äôt heard that before I am trying the AHA 30% + BHA 2% peeling solution. Tried it first about 2 weeks ago and the morning after I had a bunch of white heads on my chin, that I of course popped and since then the spots have been dry/flaky AF!! Supposed to use 1-2 times a week but I was scared after that and I think I‚Äôm gonna give it another try tonight lol Yep... Wow, that was incredible, thank you! That pretty much where I‚Äôve been - oiltopia. I‚Äôm through early onset menopause already so I think this is the skin type I‚Äôll be dealing with, at least for a couple decades.

Anything you recommend or ward against? Or are we stuck at this BK for eternity?! I hate to say this, but as someone who is 49/f and approaching painfully dry in the summer, I‚Äôd much rather have your skin than mine. :) I can‚Äôt slather enough B oil and marula oil and hemi squalane on my face. My hands crack. I was a Clinique type 3 for years and still carry shiny sheets out of paranoia/habit. I wish my hair and skin still made oil. 

That said, I know how trying it is to have your face melt off a few times a day. I do sympathize. But I miss oil a lot. That's a relief because I've been getting a new spot everyday (in places where I normally break out) since using it, although they clear up very quickly. I hope I'll have the same results. Think you should let it sink for a bit before putting anything else on your skin :(

&#x200B;

Lmao, I am getting downvoted for helping? I use the same product and the smoothness the OP mentions is not the product working on their skin but rather the texture of the product itself. That needs to be fully absorbed by the skin before you can put the next layer/sunscreen on it :/ It's when you try to put product on your skin but instead of spreading it starts forming "rolls" of product I just found out the milia under my eyes might be from rosacea, I'm going to give this a patch test! Thank you for sharing ‚ô° i'm also now wondering if it was the previous formulation (with caregeenan and castor oil) that caused people so many breakouts. looks like they reformulated about two years ago or so. i decided to pick some up today and try for myself despite my trepidations Me too! I‚Äôm having trouble because of dry temperatures and it‚Äôs the only thing from my summer routine that I‚Äôm able to use. The rest burns my skin really bad I'm curious to know what your experience happened to be with taking them on an empty stomach. No worries! It‚Äôs an awesome product!! Thanks that's super helpful I had similar problems but i mixed it 50/50 with TO hyluronic acid serum and it did the trick. I think for some people its just a bit too potent. So in all i probably smear 2 drops of niacinimide on my face and neck. Personally I am a lazy slob and refuse to do any mixing so that's part of the reason I purchased it. That's not to say it won't work for you. For me, I went from just applying it directly all over my face, to applying small amounts to my clean fingers first and working it into my face. It's been about a week since I changed the application and the difference is night and day. Definitely before. I'm no expert but the research I did before purchasing told me that the point of serums is to get the tiny moisturizing particles into your face before covering it with the heavier particles in moisturizer. I do toner, serum, then moisturizer at night; in the morning just serum and moisturizing sunscreen. You're on the right track though about letting products absorb. Many of the issues people seem to have with this product such as pilling can happen from not letting it absorb long enough. Use it before moisturizing. I let mine set before azelaic acid for 20 mins then moisturize I mix moisturizer with a few drops of oil, and then there's no pilling at all. Without the oil I find it pills a bit. Can't explain why the oil would help. Deciem is a bit notorious for quietly reformulating products. I've personally had this "huh, this is... drastically different" experience with the 23% Vit C, Marine Hyaluronics, N+Z, and NMF+HA. I saw someone mention seeing Deciem/TO mention on Instagram that the SA 2% is being reformulated currently, for example, but can't seem to dredge that up now when looking. Had no problems with my routine and i'm not using oils ( they break me out too ). Maybe it could work for you and/or others who have problems with pilling:

Avene cleansing foam - TO Niacinamide - Hada Labo Premium - CeraVe They‚Äôve actually reformulated this product many times, they just don‚Äôt tell anyone LMAO. I doubt they reformulated. I think some people just make special cocktails in order for it not to pill. 


I purchased this from Sephora like a week ago and it pills like crazy. I hate it. I use Tretinoin, so I don‚Äôt have time to try fancy cocktails in order for this cheapo product not to pill my face meds right off! Ahh, thanks! Perfect timing I‚Äôm on the AHA/BHA part of my routine right now. Thanks so much. I was really excited to try AA for the same reason and I patch tested on the side of my face and I got tiny bumps and redness the very next day ( I tried this two different times, a few weeks apart). I assumed my skin just didn‚Äôt like it. Do you think it could be purging and I should push through? Vomiting. Lots and lots of vomiting.ü§£ Definitely going to try it!  Going to Ulta tomorrow! Most clinical research has niacinamide in the 2-4% concentration range showing results so even diluting TO Niacinamide by half would retain it's effectiveness if the 10% concentration makes you break out Super informative, thanks! What does pilling mean? No idea but oils tend to me break me out so that‚Äôs a no go solution for me. I wish they did the same thing with TO that they do with NIOD - it has a version number, so you can check for a reformulation.

I love the current formulation of their niacinamide: hated the first version (it pilled and broke me out)  I have zero idea when that reformulation happened. How do you like the marine hyaluronics? I‚Äôve been wanting to try but haven‚Äôt ordered yet! No problem, hope that it will work for you as well :) I patch tested on my inner arm and I had no reaction to it whatsoever, which is one of the reasons why I think that I'm purging rather than reacting. 

Do you tend to break out in the region where you patch-tested? And did you experience any itchiness? Ugh. My least favorite. Oh wow ulta carries them? Lol I had to order mine online üòÇ Good to know its gonna still be affective either way. :) The product rolls up in little balls on your face. Usually it means too much product, or someone is not letting step A soak in before moving to B and step B pills. Sometimes it means the order of use is wrong, sometimes it‚Äôs a lack of moisture. Hyaluronic acid does it for me unless I put a splash of water on my face first. But some products just have a formulation that leads to pilling. If you streak over your skin the product clumps together into small balls, not very nice I patch tested in front of my ear, right below my hairline. No itchiness, just redness and bumps. I don‚Äôt usually break out there but it is possible...maybe I‚Äôll patch test on my arm like you‚Äôve done and see what happens... Yeah, with TO Niacinamide I've only ever experience pilling if I use too much and/or don't wait long enough between putting it on and my next step. Whenever I see people complain about how much this product pills I tend to think they're making one of those two mistakes without realizing it. I think this sub needs more posts like this to validate those of us who are fine-tuning our routine one small step at a time. Thanks for sharing!  (whispering)...it's whittled.  After struggling with some mid-20's hormonal and some normal acne, I finally eliminated the many products in my routine down to these tried-and-trues. Not pictured is arguably the most important (but least aesthetically pleasing) product that I use: Differin, which I keep in my nightstand.

My favorite part about this routine is that it is simple, affordable, and nourishing. The holy trinity!

My daily routine:

**\[AM\]** Splash face with water - The Ordinary HA + B4 - CosRX Honey Ceramide Full Moisture Cream - Sunscreen

**\[PM\]** CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser - Apply The Ordinary HA + B4 and CosRX Honey Ceramide Full Moisture Cream to a wet face - Differin to dry face every 3 days 

**\[For extra nourishment\]** Raw honey mask worn for 5 minutes in a steamy shower once a week

**\[For dry or irritated patches\]** CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (occasional use)

**\[To add a touch of softness when I want it\]** Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence (occasional use)

It may not be the most complex routine in the world, but it works incredibly well for me. My skin has never been this clear and healthy. My top takeaways from my acne journey:

* Simplify your routine. 10 steps may work for some people, but it's way too much for the majority.
* Patch. Test. I really screwed up my face by not doing this.
* Be careful with acids. They can be a miracle for some, but don't work for everyone.
* You don't have to pay a lot for great skincare. A lot of the high-end stuff has similar if not the same ingredients as "lower end" products.
* If all other products fail, give Differin a try. Just make sure you read up first to make sure you don't destroy your barrier.
* Get creative with how you display your skincare. It makes the experience that much more luxurious :)

Edit: also not pictured is my daily sunscreen. [deleted] eek! not skincare but i‚Äôve been eyeing that paul mitchell serum. how is it??  I'm liking your stuff.  I'm realizing that my face does better with just a few really good products, way better than lots of mediocre products.

The skinfood essence literally saved my face.  I was dehydrated and getting wrinkles at an extremely fast rate.  No amount of moisturizer was stopping it.  (Dunno what the heck was causing it).

My sister got me the skinfood line and it reversed my path.  Out of the thousands I've spent so far on skin products, the biggest difference for my dry and wrinkled skin is the skinfood essence, tretinoin, niacinamide, and a high quality vitamin C.  Everything else has been a waste so far.

I'm definitely wanting to try the corsx stuff.  I keep hearing good about the snail mucin. Thank you for posting this. Sometimes I feel like im not going reach my goal with my few products. Thank you so much for posting this!

This subreddit was starting to turn me off with everyone posting so many bottles of this and that on their counter... Just too overwhelming for someone who believes in a more minimalistic lifestyle.

I‚Äôm happy to see a fellow Redditor with a simplified BUT optimized routine. :) [deleted] Finally, a shelfie that doesn‚Äôt make me roll my eyes! This is lovely and it looks like you have done your research and know what to buy for yourself. Way to go! Yay!!! I sometimes feel like I'm 'bad' at skincare because I don't have a complicated routine, but it keeps me glowy and acne free. Thanks for the reassurance!  I usually use the Paul Mitchel stuff on my hair but... To each their own.






(j/k) Where do you buy the Cosrx Snail mucin? I see it on amazon but all from 3rd party sellers which I‚Äôve heard can be a bad plan  What an inspiring little shelfie :) 

I'm in the process of whittling down my own routine. I have SO MANY PRODUCTS I've acquired over the last year or so of trying to figure out my skin, trying things too quickly, buying impulsively... This last week, I bought some rubbermaid bins, and removed everything that isn't part of my minimal routine from my shelves. Getting all those things out of the bathroom and out of view is already helping so much to keep me from going off-script and throwing random things into my routine. 

The honey ceramide cream looks awesome! I'll put it on my list of things to consider in the future. :) Thanks for sharing!  I‚Äôm so happy you posted this! I just joined this sub and I love it, but all the pics with all the products is daunting. I‚Äôm just trying to find what works best for me without breaking the bank.  That Royal Honey, tho. I've been using skinfood since I lived in Korea years ago. It's my HG Good for you.  Stupid target had a bunch of Christmas sheet masks half off but I only bought 2 so that was a lot of self restraint.   Totally not skin but I love the skinny serum!! One of my favorite products ever  I need to get rid of all my old skincare üßê I love seeing posts like this instead of mini fridges full of expensive fragranced products. I have recently been dealing with some newfound dermatitis and dryness, gave away all my fancy products to friends and started oil cleansing with tallow and castor oil and just rubbing beef fat on my face to moisturize. My dermatitis has cleared and my skin has never been better, honestly. Glad you found a good routine, I‚Äôm definitely tempted to try out the propolis product! I purchased the Cosrx Honey Full Moisture a few weeks ago, and I have fallen in love with it! I love it as my final night cream. Sometimes I add their rice mask on top for extra moisture on the nights I use tretinoin. 

How do you like the Skinfood Propolis essence? I've been debating trying that one out. Wait you pee'd on your products? That can't be healthy üòâ Just want to say that Paul Mitchell serum is the best! Can‚Äôt live without it! 

Love the shelfie minimalism! Still working on mine as well  I love the little board you keep your products on; very luxurious! Where is it from? This is actually awesome! It can be kinda discouraging when you don‚Äôt necessarily have a seemingly unlimited budget to spend on skin care! Plus the thing people don‚Äôt realize is that you really do not need like 7 serums or 15 moisturizers in a ‚Äúroutine‚Äù. Half the time the stuff people are pilling on top of one another is actually harmful and counter indicative. Well I do believe in testing products and trying them out (can be pricey) or visiting a dermatologist to see what products are really good for YOUR skin! These instagram products that ‚Äúeveryone uses‚Äù are really good marketing. Like a 7 dollar Neutrogena moisturizer could potentially be more effective for my skin than my friends 70 dollar cream and vice versa. You gotta find things that work for you! And hey if 10 products a night works for you then so be it :) but I hope people don‚Äôt get discouraged with all these shelifes, find something that works for you and give it an honest go :).  Oooh I've been wanting to try the honey ceramide... Love this. I finally had to do this as well!  Tried and trues, awwww  You can't go wrong with CorsX Oh god. Snail goo. Wouldn't be without it.  This is inspiring! I‚Äôm working so hard to finish ‚Äúmeh‚Äù items that I replaced before they were finished because they didn‚Äôt fully work but I don‚Äôt want to declutter. I hope in the next six months I have only twice as much as you.  Whittled
 When you were introducing Differin did you work up to using it every night and then once you were clear did you push back to once every third night or did you do once every third night the whole time?  I love the CeraVe cleanser and that hair serum as well! I love that your skin care routine is only a few products. Some shelfies on here are very intimidating with 15+ products. 

Now that my skin-related comment is out of the way, what are your thoughts on the Paul Mitchell serum? Lol. I'm looking for a new leave-in serum.  Best cleanser ever.  Was going to say the same thing! I‚Äôm all for a good giant shelfie haul, but I think it influences some here to go out and buy tons of products - some without even knowing what they actually do. Simple is the best way! After going through The Ordinary and Asian Skincare craze due to their reasonable prices and abundance, not whittling my skincare down to tried and true. In Hawaii for travels, and it's just not pleasant juggling that many items to maintain good skin. OMG. Thanks for pointing that out, though I totally hate myself right now. I write for a living.

I'm going to blame it on the New Years hangover. It made me laugh so hard. My widdle shelf!!!  May I know what method you prefer to use to exfoliate?  Question: do the products help with hormonal acne? Because I am struggling with that (along with rosacea) and I was sort of resigned to the fact that the hormonal acne is here to stay :(  What is your daily sunscreen?  What daily spf do you use? Can you tell me a little about how you like the Skinfood Royal honey essence and the Cosrx cream? I‚Äôm looking into a little ‚Äúskintertainment‚Äù that is just a nice little fluffy product to boost my skin maybe one or two levels. I‚Äôm happy with where I am now, but I want to be chok-chok dammit! Lol Can I ask what has made the honey ceramide cream a tried and true? :)) Where do you use differin in your routine on the days you do use it?  Are you a female? Drop a pic of your skin btw.

edit: lmao nevermind, seems you can't show your skin in a skincare sub... or ask gender... You're so right. Honestly, I didn't want to say this, but now that you brought it up: As much as this sub helped me, it also was a huge factor in my product bingeing. Like you said, no hate. This sub really kicked off my love of skincare and desire to learn more. I recommend it to people. But beginners gotta know that more doesn't equal better, and it's an easy trap to fall into. Buying a lot of products is a huge waste of money and is ineffective (if not harmful) for most people.  > I love this. I‚Äôm currently in the process of a weeks-long, Marie Kondo style declutter and beauty products were the first to go.

May I ask what you've done w/ the products you decluttered?

I am a MariKondo junkie, and my mom wants to get on board. But she has a closet in her bathroom full of product, and she isn't going to get rid of anything unless it goes to a good home. This.  I gave birth to my son 6 months ago.  THERE IS NO TIME FOR ANYTHING!

After my skin going insane post partum, I basically took everything out of my drawer.  I‚Äôm on a super detox and just wash and moisturize.   not op, but if you have straight or wavy hair, you should only apply it to the ends of your hair (the most damaged bits). also, don't use too much on straight or wavy hair because it's very oily! If you have extra curly or curly hair, it can go all over your hair, since those hair types are usually drier and need extra love. 

this product smells amazing and it leaves your hair nice n soft. it also works especially well if you put it on damp hair (right after you've towel-dried your hair). if you blow-dry it in, it makes your hair feel fluffy and soft. your hair will have a bit of a sheen, too! 

edit: a couple words  to add a third opinion, I went to a paul mitchell beauty school where all the products were available for us to use on clients at all times and that particular serum was BY FAR the most popular and had to be replaced the most frequently. Other poster did a good job answering this but I'll throw in my two cents: It's a great addition to your routine if you have frizzy, thick hair. I have both and rarely blow dry. It really helps moisturize my ends. I'm pretty liberal with it at the ends and then use very sparingly near the roots. I only use it near the roots when my hair feels thirsty. 

Admittedly though, if you don't have thick hair, I feel like this could potentially be WAY too heavy and really weigh your hair down or make it look greasy. 

If you decide to purchase, start with using a half pump and work your way up (if your hair is average length). It can be difficult to gauge how much you need at first and you can easily overdo it.  The Skinfood Essence is definitely very moisturizing. A great boost to a standard moisturizer when you need it. 

Also, the snail mucin is amazing if you ever get the occasional dry itchy patch. It calms it immediately. Unfortunately, it does seem to give me blackheads if I use on my whole face, so I only ever use it as a kind of spot treatment. Lots of people have success with using it on their whole face on a daily basis though.  You absolutely can. YMMV of course but I personally believe that most people need to find a couple of products that work for them and maybe a great dermatologist to reach their goals.  Where did you get it? I‚Äôm loving it! I actually purchased mine at Ulta. The locations where I live sell them in their modest K-beauty section, along with the Honey Ceramide Cream above.  You can also get it in Soko Glam.  [deleted] also check out [jolse.com](https://jolse.com)! free worldwide shipping and good prices, ive bought stuff there several times and its been smooth all times.  Lol the beef part. But tbh if that works for you then great. Pioneer skincare... Like the founding mother's and father's.  Ew. Holy shit I thought this comment was a jerk  It can be mildly irritating for me if I use it every day, but it is a great "booster" when I want a little extra glow or moisture! Surprisingly, Target. They sold it with their more decorative kitchen wares and I figured it would be perfect for the bathroom.  It‚Äôs a benign cream. Nothing fancy. But it is incredibly nourishing and does its job perfectly. It‚Äôs my HG as well and I constantly gift it to skincare-savvy friends and relatives - I‚Äôve yet to meet someone who didn‚Äôt like it! I have experimented with different pacing. I started at once every three days and then tried other frequencies after the first month or so. 

The every three days seems to work best for my skin. Every other day I can sometimes get away with, but if I do it too frequently I get dry flakey patches. It isn‚Äôt any more effective using it more frequently, so I don‚Äôt really see a point in upping the frequency of it‚Äôs just going to irritate.  Haha, bless you! 

Possibly a UK English thing (possibly not), but ‚Äòwiddle‚Äô means pee.

I don‚Äôt have my routine down pat, and I have eczema, so this post is goals. I really will work through all the samples and creams I have and chuck out the ones that don‚Äôt work. I will I will I will. Someone did this on here a few days ago (wrote ‚Äúwiddled ‚Äú instead of ‚Äúwhittled‚Äù), and I think the general consensus is that it‚Äôs adorable and a fun play on ‚Äúlittle‚Äù, so roll with it!! The Differin increases cell turnover and has exfoliation properties. Although not a true "exfoliator" it does encourage healthy cell turnover.  The Differin is the only exfoliant I use.  Not OP but taking spironolactane has been my hormonal acne savior! It‚Äôs the only thing that keep the cysts away.  I would say hormonal acne is opportune and can have many aspects to it. For example, the week before my period my pores are more likely to clog, if I am on top of my routine I can prevent opportune acne from forming (2.5% BP masks, 2% salicylic acid product and regular use of a retinol product). However some months I will get a raging deep cyst that all I can do it try and calm it down. 

Your hormonal acne might present differently and would therefore require another approach. 

If you do a search on hormonal acne routines, you will find so many differing ones. It is because our skin is very unique. Sometimes a doctor visit is the only way to combat the issue.  Differin did help with my hormonal acne! Granted it didn‚Äôt help as much as taking birth control did for my acne, but it definitely did help. (It also fucked up my skin at first, so if you also have sensitive skin I‚Äôd stay away from it)
It‚Äôs definitely worth talking to your doctor to see if they have any recommendations since everyone‚Äôs skin is different.  I use Epi Duo and I love it though it is very drying The Differin seemed to help a lot. I also experimented with Sprio for a bit, but I found that the Differin worked better for me. Honestly,  it was difficult to tease apart what part of my acne was hormonal and what part of it was just me using too many/incompatible products. I currently use Australian Gold Botanical SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion. Honestly, I do think it clogs me a little bit -- as all sunscreens seem to. Eventually, I'd also like to find a sunscreen without all of the plant extracts. However, the price point is fantastic, there's no white cast, and it acts as a great makeup primer. When I feel like toying with my routine, the SPF is probably what I'll mess with. I have a running Google Keep list of sunscreens I'd like to try. 

Note: This response is also for u/squeege-08 and u/windlikethunder who asked about the sunscreen.  Also wondering about sunscreen! The Royal Honey is nothing revolutionary. I actually find it mildly irritating with regular use, but I like to have it every now and again when my skin just feels dull and dry. Gives it that little extra boost of glow and softness. 

The CosRX cream is amazing for my skin but definitely benign. Nothing fancy. Just locks in moisture because it‚Äôs thick and heavy. The ceramides are a fantastic plus. I can really feel the difference in my skin, particularly after regular use for the last six months. It feels healthier and more moisturized overall.  Honestly, there's not much about it that's special. But I think that's part of why it works so well for me. I'll tell you the same thing I told another user about the honey ceramide cream: 

>I have dry-ish skin that is sensitive, and prone to dehydration and clogging. This is a big reason why a lot of "fancier" products don't work for me. There's too many bells and whistles. This moisturizer is simple: Thick, nourishing, leaves a small film over the skin that makes it smooth and locks in the water and HA I use beforehand. My skin definitely feels plumper and stronger after using it consistently for over 6 months. I use it after I‚Äôve put on all of my products in the evening and let them dry down. The products serve as a buffer between my sensitive skin and the Differin without decreasing its effectiveness.

I only use it once every three days, so the exact days can vary. For example, later tonight will be a Differin night for me. Then I‚Äôll apply again on Sunday night.  [deleted] [deleted] I was away 2 days with my grandchildren and did not do one thing to my face. I have 4 big raw zits and am flaking all over. I feel your pain.
 Huh, I use it too and I personally feel its the least oily hair oil that I have tried, so I use it all over. But I guess every hair texture is different anyway. 

Agreed with the rest, the smell is the best and in my experience it actually keepa the hair protected and makes it less frizzy.  Yep. I used it years before I even went to a PM school, too ‚Äî it‚Äôs still one of my absolute favorites! (For reference: I have super normal hair, not thin/thick, just wavy and ‚Äúthere‚Äù.) I don't get dry patches since using that exact cleanser you posted.  It made a huge difference in my dry skin too.  More than moisturizer.

Is the mucin only for dry patches?  I don't really have that anymore.  Just fine lines and seemingly dehydrated skin.

There's a product I use that my skin freaking loves!  It's not a skin care product though.  It's a shaving butter.  Dr Carver's shave butter by Dollar shave club.  This stuff makes my skin feel even better than the essence, for way cheap.  I noticed that the days I shave my skin was super smooth, so now I put it on and rinse it off even on days I'm not shaving.  Considering your face seems to like the same things as mine, it might be worth trying!  It's only like 7$.  I leave it on long enough to shave (2-3 minutes) and then rinse. Also, I'm reading that blackheads are just oxidation.  So maybe something in the mucin is very easily oxidized.  Use a high quality vitamin C and see if that stops the blackheads.  There's a cheap one by "shero science" that's 25$ that works amazing. Dont get me started on dermatologists! That may be the hardest part (besides being to broke to test products).

Not looking for sympathy or anything, but I thought I was prepared  on how hard it would be to find the right dermatologist for me, but I wasnt!:D

Currently too scared to return to the old one and all the other ones in my city dont take new patients. [deleted] Found it!

https://www.target.com/p/14-x-9-oval-serving-platter-marble-wood-threshold-153/-/A-17408550 I‚Äôm hoping they have it in stock in a store because right now it‚Äôs sold out online! But that seems like a reliable source, thank you! That seems like it should be legit! Otherwise I don‚Äôt know what to think! I didn‚Äôt see them selling it I‚Äôll look closer Lol judgmental much? Animal fats are probably the oldest skin moisturizers humans have used, it‚Äôs just in the past century or so people have demonized them for far inferior plant oils. Check out the vitamin content of tallow from grass fed cows. But you can lead a horse to water, etc etc I‚Äôve been curious about this cream as well - what skin type do you have?  Ok good to know.  I've been trying to do everything day but my face gets red after a couple so I don't think it's worth it to irritated my skin  It definitely means that in Australia as well. I assume that came with our British heritage, so it probably also carries that meaning in other Commonwealth countries as well.  It's also the word for pissing yourself. Oh god please no When I see ‚Äúwiddle,‚Äù I think urine. :/  That was me!!! Lol i thought OP was in on the joke  Fortunately the cysts went away but I will ask my doc about it!  How long does it take for all your products to absorb into your skin?  What an odd answer. Skincare sub but you can't show your skin? That's like going to the fitness subreddit and not seeing any physiques.

Why do I ask gender? Because lots of products. Skincare differs from male to female, or am I wrong? I had trouble with this too. Even for stuff that had obviously gone bad, I kept thinking SOMEONE would want it. 

Recycling packaging, offering non expired products to friends, and donating unopened products to the local homeless shelter helped me to get over that mentality. 

It helped that my aunt lectured me to throw away the lip gloss she‚Äôd given me for Christmas‚Äî back when I was in my mid teens. She was like... ‚Äú that was 15 years ago throw it away. I am not offended.‚Äù  > I hope this helps, everyone is different and it‚Äôs a hard thing to overcome!

Absolutely, thank you for taking the time to reply!
 I had to get rid of basically 90% of products I've owned when I finally realized my skin isn't friends with fragrance at all. Even though all of it was drugstore it still took me ages to get the courage to throw it out. Some of it went to my friends, some to the bin, no regrets.
I also agree with the temptation this group was for me. I thought I was a skin care addict because I owned like 12 products in total and then I joined this group and saw there are people with whole shelves stacked with skin care. For a moment that almost made me buy 10 products for basically no reason (thankfully that didn't happen) because I justified it with "well these people own much more of these".
Starting out quite simple fragrance free routine now,  gradually adding one piece by another hoping it'll be effective enough without breaking my budget.
Sorry for this way too long essay and thanks for a great post reminding me not to buy unnecessary stuff.  oh, I should have been more clear: too much of it in one spot may lend to an oily feel/appearance! I'm not experienced with many other hair oils tbh, I worked at a PM salon and have biased knowledge since we only used PM products üòÖ heh! [deleted] It was Target. At least that‚Äôs where I got mine.  Nice! Check SokoGlam, YesStyle, and iHerb. They‚Äôll probably have it.  Ew. I have dry-ish skin that is sensitive, and prone to dehydration and clogging. This is a big reason why a lot of "fancier" products don't work for me. There's too many bells and whistles. This moisturizer is simple: Thick, nourishing, leaves a small film over the skin that makes it smooth and locks in the water and HA I use beforehand. My skin definitely feels plumper and stronger after using it consistently for over 6 months.  Yeah it‚Äôs really not worth it. Slow and steady wins the race when it comes to retinoids. I also found that layering it OVER all of my products was the best way to go. Putting it on freshly cleansed skin with no moisturizer as a buffer just irritated the hell out of my face. 

I know this sub doesn‚Äôt love her, but I really think Dr. Dray‚Äôs videos on YouTube give great advice for people using retinoids for the first time. She really keeps things in perspective about timing, and helps minimize irritation. Highly recommend if you haven‚Äôt looked her up yet.  I‚Äôm Aussie and I‚Äôve never heard ‚Äòwiddle‚Äô to mean pee. Only as a childlike way of saying ‚Äòlittle‚Äô. That‚Äôs really interesting. My mum is pretty much the only person I have ever heard say ‚Äòwiddle.‚Äô  Amazing user name Nope. Just dreadfully hung over and my fingers moved faster than my brain unfortunately.  It usually takes around 2-3 minutes because I apply all of them (except sunscreen or Differin) to a wet face.  Yeah but the way you asked it was super creepy and implied that you were much more interested in looking at a picture of a girl than inquiring about skincare You're wrong.  I think I understand what you were trying to say, but I think to a lot of people it initially came off as "send nudes, thx." I'm happy to provide B&A photos a little later today.

Also, just as an FYI, my understanding is that the difference between male and female skin is nominal. Men's skin is slightly thicker than female skin on a cellular level. Men's bodies obviously produce more testosterone, so they may be more prone to acne -- particularly in their teen years.  From what I understand, that's where the differences end. Pretty much all products can be interchangeable between men and women. The rest of it is just branding and marketing. [deleted] This was me and phenoxyethanol. 

The majority of my products had this in and I had to get rid of so much. I then went on a phenoxyethanol free binge... which lasted a long time. 

I then over exfoliated and ended up with skin further away from my skincare goals. It took a bout of severe depression, where I couldn't do anything for 7 months, to the point of looking at my product stash caused a panic attack.

 Got rid of everything in Feb 2018, except the skincare trifecta. Moisturiser, sunscreen and cleanser. I slowly built up my routine, with ample trial times (30 days) and a better understanding of my skin.

For 2019, I want to streamline my routine... instead of a separate moisturiser and ceramide product. I want to blend the 2. I have very few options, like only 2, but fingers crossed this year it will happen. 

Sorry for the word splurge, but it is cool to think about.  Ahh, that js certainly true! 

Yeah I go to a PM salon too, thats where I got it from. Also can only recommend their circular brushes :D  https://www.sheroscience.com/products/power-c-serum

I think they're still running a deal right now for first time buyers where you get the serum for 10$ shipped.  Use the code "sheroscience".

If that doesn't work, there's a 20% off code "shero20".

This stuff is worth every penny at retail. Thank you for your reply that‚Äôs super helpful to know - I am currently trying to switch from the Rodan and Fields SOOTHE regimen, and that cream was recommended as a potential alternative to the R&F moisture replenishing cream by another Reddit user. I have very dry, sensitive skin and I‚Äôm prone to cystic/hormonal acne on my chin.  That is weird to assume such a thing, wasn't the purpose. I asked for SKIN specifically, so we're probably speaking about face here... >I think I understand what you were trying to say, but I think to a lot of people it initially came off as "send nudes, thx." I'm happy to provide B&A photos a little later today.

Exactly this! I'm looking forward to the B&A.

>The rest of it is just branding and marketing.

Oh damn, kinda expected that.

I'm looking for a minimal skincare routine since my skin isn't too bad, it's just fucked from all the fighting and chafing from the mats (I do BJJ). So casually browsing and already found some products to buy here from your list. Gonna start with the Cerave stuff. Here here... it is a journey though. Isn't it. 

Eta: I want a minimal skincare thread, i think it could work. MOD's are you reading!! Here here! Minimalist and high efficacy skincare regimen. I'd love for that to happen. Sometimes I'm glad I'm student with such a limited budget which doesn't allow me to spend carelessly that much. I could read that DE will turn my cheeks to gold but I still won't purchase it because that thing is like half of my monthly budget. That's why I'm so glad for any recommendations for drugstore products that really work.

And yes I think we all start to hate Buzzfeed at one point of our lives. Dude you're just gross. Accept it and move on Just to make sure I understand, do you mean start with Cerave products in general or the cleanser I have above? If so, make sure you have a moisturizer first. All cleansers -- even gentle ones like the Cerave Hydrating -- have surfactants and detergents in them that strip the skin of its natural oils. This can damage the skin if you're not restoring that with a moisturizer.  If you're building a routine from the ground up, definitely start with a moisturizer first. Cerave products are still a good starting point for this.  Roger that! I was planning to buy cleanser + moisturizer, yes. Hmmmm I bet I can guess your favorite color! üòÇ This shelfie is so cute. Not skincare but I‚Äôve been eyeing the Gucci bloom for awhile - do you think it‚Äôs worth the splurge?  How do people layer so many products on their skin without breaking out? Your shelfie is beautiful, I wish I could incorporate in more stuff without my skin acting a fool. This is so aesthetically pleasing  I just recently introduced my first AHA (drunk elephant sample) into my skincare and I had two red small bumps pop up. However I do believe its just a small purge!

Daily Routine

AM - Glossier Cleanser,  Glow Recipe Moisturizer

PM - Purity Cleanser around eyes >Glossier Cleanser on whole face ( massage w/o water first) > Drunk Elephant AHA (I have a few samples I've been using before I commit to buying the whole bottle lol) > Glow Recipe Moisturizer > Glow Recipe Sleep Mask and then laniege lip mask ( these two things only every 2-3 days)

&#x200B;

All the things listed above are my must haves!

The glossier cleanser is a super nice jelly cleanser that takes patience. I use a small drop of water mixed with the cleanser and massage in circles with my hands to remove all makeup. I have to go in with my philosophy cleanser around eyes to get rid of that waterproof eye makeup.

Drunk Elephant AHA has improved my overall skin, it definitely helped made my skin more brighter!

Extra things I don't use on a daily basis or just new to me:

Clarisonic Smart - W/ cashmere brush head. Recent purchase, I won't be using it very often because I dont think its very good for daily usage. Waiting to get the massage head when I decide on a serum! Seen how it helped sculpted my friends side of her face...

Farmacy Bright On - used it once, might return seeing as I had a red patch pop up but face felt super clean. Will try it out one more time!

La Mer Cream - a little too light and pricey for me, a gift from mom!

DL Luxury Dadi Lotion - purchased from my nail tech, super soft and doesn't leave my hands greasy

I do want to add heavy duty cream and oil cleanser for my night time routine. I recently had a sample of Drunk Elephant polypeptide cream and I woke up to very soft skin! Will be purchasing after the Christmas rush has died down.. I haven't used any of these products but the baby pink is so pretty üòç I'm a sucker for cute packaging üôÑ The Drunk Elephant sample that's pictured isn't the AHA, but rather the hydration serum. It contains sodium hyaluronate, B5, amino acids, and pineapple ceramides. (https://www.drunkelephant.com/products/b-hydra-intensive-hydration-serum)

The AHA in this routine is featured in the Watermelon Sleeping Mask, containing glycolic and lactic acids. (https://www.glowrecipe.com/products/glow-recipe-watermelon-glow-sleeping-mask)

The important thing is that these products are working for you and your skin! Cheers!  Looove this shelfie and your aesthetic!

Two quick questions -

I‚Äôve been thinking about buying the Glossier Milky Jelly as a first cleanse/makeup remover. In your experience does it leave a film on your face after, or leave it dry in any way?

Also, which flavor of the Laneige Lip Mask is your fave? ‚ò∫Ô∏è It looks so pretty! What‚Äôs that pink juice glass bottle next to glossier? It looks pretty. I want to try This is the most beautiful shelf I‚Äôve ever seen. I love the Glow Recipe Watermelon Sleeping Mask! Its a fairly new find for me, and I've been using it every day so far. How do you like the Glow Recipe Moisturizer? Does it have a similar texture/feel as the sleeping mask?  Love this pink hue so calming  Very prettyüòçüòç Lovely design! 10/10 How‚Äôs the watermelon moisturizer? This shelfie üòç The Glow Recipe Watermelon night mask seriously improved my dry skin SO much! Omg I love la neige! It's saved my lips in Canadian winters in my dry ass apartment!! This looks fantastic! Where is this shelf from? "Basisc" she said, with La Mer and other high priced products. 

Still the aesthetic thoüëå Daaang. This is both aesthetically pleasing and luxurious! Well done, you! The aesthetic needs have been met, my eyes say thank you  I use those same coconut makeup wipes! This is so beautiful üòç Renovating my bathroom right now and this is bathroom vanity goals. I'm sure this has been said, but this belongs on a pink moodboard or something Wow you‚Äôre rich. Omg this aesthetic  Beautiful! I'm just starting to get into more high end skin care, I've always been more focused on makeup but now that I'm getting to be in my late 20's I've decided to up my skin care game. Any products you recommend? I almost picked up the watermelon moisturizer at Sephora, how is it? What are your thoughts on the philosophy cleansed? I've been looking for a good cream cleanser for a while. What do you think of the anti gravity spray? [deleted] I‚Äôm jealous of your watermelon glow products. I tried the sheet mask since it came in Allure and it was so good!  I also recently bought a similar watermelon sleep mask. And I was so excited to use it but I'm not sure if my dry skin and break is due to that or my period..ugh Just picked up that Laneige lip mask and used it last night! I like it. Hopefully it works if I keep using it and keeps my lips from getting all cracked from the cold! How do you like it?  The colour scheme is so PLEASING So cute  wow now thats a shelfie to be proud of Nice!! I just got the Laneige lip treatment from Santa.. any thoughts on that?? How do you get such an amazingly coordinated shelf?! I'm still looking for things that work and cost less than my kidney on the black market. Coordinating it all is beyond me What is the stipply thing that cleans your face called. I want to buy one but I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs called. The little pink machine????

Thank you That‚Äôs so aesthetically pleasing omg Glossier is everywhere üò≠ obv not in Italy  this is BEYOND pleasing Oooooo that looks beautiful and amazing I love it!!!  Omg I love gucci bloom Its lovely! At first glance the top shelf looks like it was drawn  Holy goals. This is a beautiful shelfie. Thanks for sharing!  Man I love purity it's my main face wash  Where can I get this cabinet? This is so aesthetically pleasing Where did you get this cabinet? I love it!  This is so aesthetically pleasing! Aesthetic üëåüèª So much pink! üòç This is very aesthetically pleasing. Swooooon So satisfying! Wow, I wish my skin care was this organized  For a moment I thought this was a drawing. Beautiful color composition! The glow recipe packaging is sooo nice but it's expensive, is it worth it??? So aesthetically pleasing! I wish I had the money to have so many beautiful luxury products; I bet your skin looks amazing and you feel amazing every time you open your cupboard!!  So aesthetic So beautiful üò≠ Shelfie so cute So pretty  This is the most aesthetic shelf I have ever seen. Pink is also my favorite color. this shelfie also belongs in r/accidentallywesanderson looks pretty but some of these synthetic products make me cringe, especially philosphy for face and eye wash. what is a lip mask? it doesn‚Äôt come off really fast?  Prolly black ü§î It's a very casual everyday perfume, not something I would wear to a dinner date! It has a powdery smell and for some people it may smell very old lady. I've had mixed compliments! I does wear very well through out the day!  I've been wearing Gucci Bloom and I love it! I definitely do gravitate towards powdery florals (I love the jasmine in this!) which isn't for everyone, but I find it a very elegant scent! I‚Äôve been using it for a few months now - it‚Äôs very nice and good for my office wear but I find it doesn‚Äôt stay long at all. Even when I first started using it I felt it would disappear off clothes/my skin within 2 hours. I like it but find that it is so flowery it can almost smell artificial if I over-apply. It packs a nice punch initially, but fades quickly. I like it more as a summer scent.  100% yes I feel so damn upper class wearing it. Like a classy call-girl hahahah Personally the Gucci bloom nettare do fiori is better ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have it on sale on Mercari if you want! Bought from Gilt for a friend. I have a ton of products but I don't use them all at once. Some for morning some for evening, some for if my skin is super dry... Etc you start with one and add another over time then another.  eventually you are layer 6-8 products and your skin looks amazing with no break outs at all. The trick is giving each product time to absorb before adding another My skin doesn't break out from layering skin care, I guess you need correct product combinations. Maybe some of the ingredients you use are too harsh or don't work with other products?
I also tend to apply them in order of thickness. Why would you want to use more?  The blue bottle is the AHA? Cause that‚Äôs not AHA. It‚Äôs a hydration serum from DE.  [deleted] If you‚Äôre still looking for a heavy duty oil cleanser for PM: try heimish all clean balm, I swear by that stuff, massaging it while it melts it‚Äôs almost therapeutic. It also comes with a spatula and lid to store it inside the product. You don‚Äôt need much each time so it lasts longer than what it seems.

It does have an herbal smell though, it‚Äôs different but personally I find it very pleasant. It‚Äôs also an emulsifying oil cleanser so it‚Äôs all great <3

Oh, and I think it would look pretty cute since it fits the aesthetics lol. Banila co clean it zero it‚Äôs another option, I‚Äôve never tried that one but it has a great reputation.  doesn‚Äôt the watermelon mask contain aha too? so technically that would be your first aha product??  Ugh I really wish I could buy Dadi Oil not from a nail tech! I haven‚Äôt heard of this cashmere brush. Looks really nice! Glow Recipe Watermelon Pink Juice Moisturizer :) Its a light gel moisturizer! I have sensitive skin and it has not broken my out once! I started using it beginning of August and I still have half the bottle! I do recommend getting a heavier moisturizer for night time if your skin has been super dry lately. However I just pair it with the glow recipe watermelon sleeping mask to help with the dreary winter skin :) Yes! The moisturizer has the sameish feeling but very light and melts into the skin way faster so I can go do my makeup for the day! The sleeping mask is more slimy and I just slab it on my face before I crawl into bed. haha I‚Äôve also used it - loved it. Honestly the only reason I switched it out of my daily is that I wanted to add in a peptide cream and it didn‚Äôt seem to layer as well as my cream based moisturizer (DE lala retro). OP mentioned in another comment that it‚Äôs just slightly watered down version of their sleep mask which is one of my all time favorites.  Not OP, but this has been my go to for a while. I would always go back to it and finally resigned myself that this was what worked best for me (fairly normal skin, gets dry in winter, nominal breakouts, small patches of rosacea on cheeks). I waited until philosophy had a sale and I bought the big jug with the pump.  Not OP but I use KM shampoo, conditioner and purple shampoo. I'm slowly building up a whole haircare routine with them. I'm obsessed with the smell and my hair has never been so smooth. I started dying my hair about 9 months ago and I wanted to make sure it didn't get damaged from the processing. It‚Äôs okay, I personally really like the Arituam ginger sugar lip mask. The Laneige one smells great (I have vanilla), but it doesn‚Äôt do much more for me than a lip balm. The Arituam lip mask is still on my lips when I wake up in the morning and it‚Äôs made my lips noticeably smoother.  Definitely check out the sidebar and guides if you haven‚Äôt. A lot of holy grail products within the community are more accessible and under $20 (plus Ulta coupons, target sales/cartwheel app, etc can help a lot!) without having to compromise on quality. My routine consists of some products that are $5 and others that are $50, but just find what works best for your lifestyle and skin! What do you mean by ‚Äúsynthetic products‚Äù? I didn‚Äôt realize that the Philosophy cleanser was all that bad. I‚Äôm not a fan of isopropyl alcohol / SD / denatured since it can be drying, but unless someone is very sensitive to fragrance or concerned about ‚Äúparabens‚Äù it seems pretty okay. A lip mask is a more intensive lip treatment that is usually thicker than a typical balm, but some are fairly lightweight (Bite‚Äôs lip mask is thicker than Aquaphor, whereas Laniege‚Äôs version is a more silky texture). IME some of the product will absorb while the rest sits on top, but I always wake up with soft lips. Was gonna say green.. I mean look at that pop I think we may have similar tastes. What‚Äôs your favorite(s) for a night out/date?
 About how much time? I don't have much time in the morning because I much prefer sleep to taking longer to get ready Yeah i have also heard order of thickness My current routine of CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion is getting bland lol. I've even had to give up sunscreen for awhile because I haven't found one yet that doesn't make my skin flip out and doesn't make me a greaseball. Not op but I had a bottle of it. Was totally ‚Äúmeh‚Äù about it towards the end. Felt like it became less effective. I use la roche posay now and love it. Gentle, better ingredients and better price. It‚Äôs basically has the same pro‚Äôs as glossiers milky jelly but... better. You just don‚Äôt get the cutesy marketing/packaging lmao i'd like to know too, everything i've heard so far amounts to "it's okay but there's way better things at better price points" My favorite basic cleanser is the Fresh soy face cleanser, or Farmacy clean bee. Both are so gentle and refreshing although the Fresh is a little less scented  Have you tried Amazon? I've bought it there! And how about the glossier jelly cleanser?? It looks nice too. Is that good?? I want to order everything now lmao I waaaaant it. It‚Äôs so pretty! Hahahah where can i order it??  That's awesome, thank you! I will probably give it a try! :) Nice! What‚Äôs your skin type? I‚Äôve been eyeing it for a while I feel like the Aritaum Ginger Sugar Lip Mask comes up every time Laneige lip masks do, and just, people seem to like it a *lot* more as a heavy hitter. Damnit, fine. I'm sold. Ordering some as a birthday present to myself. [removed] There is this perfume my husband bought me last year called Incanto Bloom and omg it‚Äôs so good! I‚Äôve never gotten so many compliments on my perfume before. It‚Äôs like $30 for a 4oz bottle on amazon. I have had tons of people stop me and ask what perfume I‚Äôm wearing. I think it‚Äôs definitely worth a try! It‚Äôs a very clean scent with a tiny hint of sweet.  i‚Äôd like to know also üôà Depends on the product and your skin, my toner and serums absorb in like 2 mins or less but my moisturizer takes a few mins because it's heavier, shouldn't be more than 5 to 8 mins max for heavier stuff. Also I like to use one of those Chinese fans to help it absorb and dry a bit faster they have them at the dollar store and amazon I do a quick morning routine but do a nice long self-care spa-like layering night treatment. It gives me alone time because the husband knows not to mess with me This happened to me.I knew how important it was to wear sunscreen but  anytime I did I would break out. Then finally I googled it and found out that certain skin types tend to break out with Chemical sunscreens. (I googled it because don‚Äôt have the money to go to a dermatologist nor do I have insurance). 

So, try using only physical sunscreens. if you don‚Äôt know what the difference is please Google it. It may save you a lifetime of frustration and breakouts. 

You should always, always, always wear sunscreen, everyday. 

Cancer is no joke. Plus, even if you don‚Äôt get cancer, who the hell wants to look like leather?  I want cerave  Oh nice, thanks! Any ideas for where to buy the whole Dadi family? You neeeeed it! It's my favourite cleanser of ALL TIME! I even got my friend and mother hooked on it! Its very milky and jelly! You have to have patience a little because it does involve lots of circular motions however its very gentle and leaves your skin nice feeling at the end! I pat my face every day with a white face cloth to double check and it passes every time since I take my time! I can use it and open my eyes after without stinging because the solution has the same chemicals in contact solution so very friendly! However its not the best at removing waterproof mascara and liner so I do recommend using another cleanser or micellar water. I use Philosophy Purity Made Simple Onestep Facial Cleanser.    Sephora. I believe the watermelon gift set is on sale at the moment, and you can get an extra 20% off
 Combination, running drier in the winter. I‚Äôm also pretty sensitive to new products and had no trouble rolling this in.   My older sister bought it for me for Chanukah because she knows how much I love Asian skincare. They have it on Amazon!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I feel calm looking at your skincare products. Not at all overwhelmed. I hope I can get as minimal as you with my skincare (if my skin ever allows me). Smaller does NOT mean inferior. Some people‚Äôs routines are just tooooo much imho. How do you like the vitamin c serum? I was thinking of adding this to my routine my super simple routine: 

so i‚Äôm new to skincare, and only started about 2-3 weeks ago but i‚Äôm already noticing big differences!! i tend to get very cystic, under the skin acne. i also have slightly oily skin and a lot of scarring/hyperpigmentation on the sides of my face which i‚Äôm trying to get rid of

MORNING:

1. CeraVe foaming facial cleanser (for normal to oily skin), 
2. CeraVe skin renewing vitamin C serum to help lighten my scars/even my skin tone
3. CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion (for normal to dry skin) 
4. Aveeno SPF 50 sunscreen, which smells amazing and is moisturizing as well 

NIGHT: 
1. CeraVe foaming facial cleanser
2. Bliss replenishing watermelon toner (with witch hazel, willow bark, and hyaluronic acid). **this product is also CRUELTY-FREE/VEGAN**
3. CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion 

it‚Äôs definitely not as involved as some other routines but it‚Äôs working for me so far and in a few months i hope i‚Äôll be able to post a clear skin progress pic !! I prefer yours, actually. Those big shelfies always remind me of dorm bathrooms with an overcrowding of products that essentially do the same thing Wait CeraVe makes a vitamin c serum?! How's it working for you? Simple shelfies are my favorite shelfies How are you liking the Aveeno spf? Is it pretty moisturizing on it's own or do you have to use the Cerave with it? Does the spf sting your eyes at all? Been on the fence about the vit c serum for weeks and FINE ALRIGHT ILL FINALLY PULL THE TRIGGER How ya liking that What a Melon?  I'm not in the market just yet, but I saw it at the store and was intrigued. The more simple the routine, the better for your skin! Most people on her get carried away with all the ingredients, they lose sight of what's best for the skin. I appreciate this because it‚Äôs realistic, obtainable, and logically safe. 


Some of these people in here with their 45 random new products every week without an ill effects is just absurd. How scented is the toner? I love the smell of watermelon and keep wanting to try that product. Ah, I wrote up this whole response about CeraVe's sunscreen and then I saw that you use Aveeno's sunscreen! 

Anyways, I love your routine! Nothing wrong with a very simple routine. Mine is very small as well and is all CeraVe save for my Curology serum. So glad that it is working for you! Doesn‚Äôt matter the size. It‚Äôs the effectiveness of the products. Great choices. don‚Äôt worry! it‚Äôs not about size This is similar to my routine. When I stopped using so many products and washing my face as much it got so much better at least with milia not cystic acne. It also gets worse if I don‚Äôt do anything though so it‚Äôs good to find a happy medium. :) Keep it simple, less chance of making your skin angry Thats all that matters OP! As long as it works for your needs :)

I recently realized I don‚Äôt need to be frustrated when popular items dont work well for my face even tho a bunch of others claim it does wonders for theirs. I‚Äôm happy with my routine and have seen improvements, and thats all that matters I want to drink the forbidden m e l o n water it looks refreshing lol but seriously less is better for me so I love this! Ugh I need to shave down my routine to something this minimal because then I‚Äôd be motivated to actually fucking do it but.....I‚Äôm obsessed with buying products like water üò° I love it! I feel like a lot of the excessive cluttered shelfies are just pissing contests. Hey what type of ascorbic acid does your vitamin C serum have in the ingredients? Quality over quantity! Small shelfie, fat wallet. Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre winning lol üòÇ I've heard that you shouldn't mix niacinamide with vitamin C, how does that work if the niacinamide is in a cleanser like this one? Finally, a reasonable shelfie. How does the Aveeno hydrate feel? I love aveeno products and am looking for a great, every day sun screen. I just don‚Äôt want it too greasy or too thick. I stopped using the daily moisturizing lotion because I was certain it had to be body lotion. Time to dig that puppy out Hello experts! Is there any difference in the cerave hydrating cleanser vs the foaming cleanser besides the foam? How do you say Cerave Is the bliss toner good? Simple is best üëèüëèüëè My favourite are the minimal shelfies. There's something satisfying about seeing at a glance all the products you need to make your skin happy and that you don't actually need a lot. The big shelfies give me anxiety and can be confusing with all the different products (which ones are actually being used, or work...) Uhg youll probably never see this comment, but what do you wash and dry your face off with? Meaning like do you use your hands and a regular towel? Im new to skincare. I use that face wash and it‚Äôs great, like it actually works to stop my breakouts.üôåüèΩüôåüèΩ I‚Äôm so jealous of your minimalism! Interesting. The CeraVe foaming cleanser dried out my skin a lot and made it crack, even though my skin is mixed.  I think it also destroyed my moisture barrier, because everything stung afterwards. Obviously I yeeted it out of my routine. Tbh I'm not touching other CeraVe products, even if they are much cheaper than my current stuff. Honestly I prefer small and simple over overly complicated. I just don't think it's needed, or even good for your  skin to use a dozen different products Honestly, CeraVe is what my dermatologist recommended for me to use. Sometimes less is more! Honestly, I love a minimal skincare routine. This routine is so no frills, just about quality products. Love it! Size doesn‚Äôt matter but how you use it does Can I ask why you didn‚Äôt opt for CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 30 in the morning? Simple is good üëç I only have the CeraVe facial cleanser for skin care lol but I really want to add these to my routine! In place of or along with? How do you like the sunscreen? I have very oily skin and am searching around for a nice spf that doesn't leave an oily sunscreen-y cast. Less is more sometimes. :) [deleted] I wonder if the Aveeno sunscreen is any good these days. I use to use it like 6yrs ago but the sunscreen and oil separated and came out a greasy clumpy mess so I dropped it and never looked back. i feel like your bathroom smells like a pharmacy Have you tried the Renew night cream? I'm think of buying that but it's kinda expensive. [deleted] Oooh didn't know aveeno had a suncream! Probably not available in the UK... They're not cruelty free either but I'm struggling to find a suncream with a good ingredient list Do you keep your serum in the fridge? WHATEVER works!üòò There's nothing wrong with your minimal use of products! Honestly looking at it made me feel calm because when I see 7+ products I start to feel overwhelmed. Looks like you don't have to worry too much about the products expiring either! Sometimes I see ten products or more and wonder how those people manage to use it all the time before it expires.

So yeah, take pride in the fact that yours is a small collection! As long as it works! :) i loooove love that toner so much. it made my skin a lot smoother than it was That CeraVe foaming cleanser is EVERYTHING. üòÇ Smaller is better less is more tbh, I don't understand how people stay organized enough to rotate their 16 different products lmao It‚Äôs so appealing to my eyes idk how to explain it Smaller but actually much more effective that other collections with mostly garbage products I wish this sub would get over Cerave. Glorified junk Cerave is a terrible brand. Bliss is decent for drug store brand. 
-licensed esthetician I recently had to stop buying my favorite subscription box. I loved the fun products but it made me feel overwhelmed to have so many products! I also hope to get back to a minimal routine. My routine is as minimal as possible, partially because with rosacea, touching my face makes it worse lol. It's nice to see others with such a minimal routine too Me too. All I can think of for some of those routines is 

1) how do you have time to use that every day? 
2) how can you use a third of all that before it expires I totally agree. I once fell for the whole needing ten products in your routine not realizing it was making my skin so much worse. Once I simplified the hell out of my routine, my skin has never looked better im loving it so far !!! my scars used to be really really dark and i‚Äôve been so self conscious but they‚Äôre already lightening up way more than i expected. i recommend it highly Same! This is sitting in my Target cart right now! I like simple personally ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Stick with simple. It can be easy to view skincare as a hobby, but it's actually like brushing your teeth -- it's for your health! Using too many products is a good way to end up with weird sensitivities and breakouts.

If you get cystic acne, I would see a dermatologist or at least try adapolene and benzoyl peroxide, both of which you can get OTC :) These are medications so it's a bit different than adding a bunch of toners/serums/essences to your routine. You‚Äôve inspired me to buy all these products! We have similar skin. Thank you! i bought the cerave foaming facial cleanser in janurary due to recs on here and recently discovered that it has been the cause of my skin irritation and closed comedones as of late T_T back to cetaphil ig We have similar skin types/issues and my routine is almost identical! I use the Cerave SA cleanser instead of the foaming and I also use the Cerave HA serum at night, but no toner. I might give the Bliss toner a try though, it sounds great! does anyone have a cruelty free rec for SPF comparable to the aveeno? How is the aveeno sunscreen? First sunscreen I bought when I came US was aveeno(it was different formula) and man how I started dreading even the thought of putting sunscreen on? Sooo sticky, I can stick post stamp with it. I was looking at this toner recently! Can you tell me more about it? I'm looking for hydrating so I wonder if you find that the other ingredients ensure that the witchhazel is not drying? Thanks for your post (: yeah i don't think more is necessarily better. so well!!! i can already see a big difference and actually posted a progress pic on my instagram in just 2 weeks. i 100% recommend it bc my hyperpigmentation has been BAD for years Not OP, but I use this exact product! It's moisturizing enough for me that I don't use a separate moisturizer with it (I have fairly normal skin, weather is currently cold where I live). I've never had my eyes sting while using this. It‚Äôs moisturizing on its own !! i do use the CeraVe with it just as part of my routine anyway but it could double as a moisturizer. i do end of rubbing my eyes occasionally which causes them to sting from the sunscreen but just wearing it i have no problem I wish it worked for me, it breaks me out terribly! I know it‚Äôs because the ingredients in it are what is seen in chemical sunscreens, & chemical sunscreens break me out so that is the culprit lol Wish it worked for me, it does smell good, but it made my eyes sting as well, still looking for the holy grail physical/mineral sunscreen YES JOIN US! you‚Äôll love it honestly i like it! it‚Äôs been part of my routine since the first day and the witch hazel is helping my skin a lot I have combination skin and purchased the ‚Äúwhat a melon‚Äù toner. It burned. Like, felt like my skin was coming off. I was really disappointed because I like bliss products. After I did a review on the toner a lot of people had the same issues I did with it. Yeah and I've seen Instagram accounts where they review or post like 5 new products every week and every single post is "omg I love it I use this all the time". No thanks I think you lying. honestly? i have a terrible nose, like my sinuses suck, but to me it doesn‚Äôt smell that much like watermelon which was disappointing What did you have to say about CeraVe's sunscreen? I'm curious because it's what I use, but I never see it in people's shelfies so there must be something people don't like about it. The cerave has 10% L- ascot if acid I was using but personally didn‚Äôt notice a huge difference and it made my ultra light moisturizer from cerave more greasy which is already bad on my already oily skin. I‚Äôm stopping the serum to see if I can notice a difference in skin tone and acne scars etc but I will say that the serum want on super nice and the packaging is great for preventing oxidation That "rule" is based on some old studies where the conditions were very different to the everyday conditions you would use them at. In conclusion, it's safe to use them together. if you combine the two it might create niacin, nicotinic acid. Harmless, but causes your skin to flush red. Terrible for when you're about to leave the house, so keep it in the PM. i love it !!  i hate to be cheesy but it feels... hydrating. it could double as a moisturizer but i like my moisturizer :) it doesn‚Äôt feel thick or greasy at all foaming cleanser is better for oily skin, hydrating is better for dry skin :) this may be more detailed than you‚Äôre asking for BUT: i wet my face first with my hands, then put on my cleanser and wash it off with my hands and water as well, then i use either a washcloth or a regular towel to dry off :) different things work for different people! i‚Äôm happy if your current products work for you :) you could ask !! my reason would be that i‚Äôm very new to skin care and honestly still learning what the best options are :) my friend did suggest that SPF 50 was best for me though so i thought that 30 was too low ? my skin type is oily and i absolutely love this sunscreen, it leaves me feeling hydrated not oily oily OMG it‚Äôs definitely not like that now!! not even a little No, the CeraVe foaming facial cleanser washes your face. the vitamin c serum is used to even out your skin tone (for hyperpigmentation issues etc), the moisturizer is to keep your skin,, well,, moisturizer after the cleaning, and the SPF 50 sunscreen is obviously to protect your skin from the sun. the toner is to hydrate your skin Nope! room temperature , kept in my bathroom in the box so it doesn‚Äôt oxidize white on white with pops of color LOL sorry that we don‚Äôt cater to your personal desires :( and what qualifies it as terrible Be careful this sub is basically r/ceraveaddiction 

Those that use more than the bare bones get roasted for having too big of a routine. 

Or, if you use more expensive products you get accused of wasting your money and made to feel stupid for ‚Äúbuying for the packaging‚Äù as if you aren‚Äôt being thoughtful with routine or money. 

I don‚Äôt disagree with your comments but it would be helpful to know more about why something is or isn‚Äôt good. As an esthetician you have a good opportunity to educate and help in this sub :) What box did you subscribe to? :) okayyy so when does shit expire?? i feel like i have old stuff from my mom (lol) lying around all the time and still use them when i run out. like... 2-3 years later.

EDIT: and what happens if they do expire?? That's awesome! Thanks for the recommendation. Has it helped with texture? Is that what the vitamin c serum is good for? Healing or? Have you noticed the metal tip around the vitamin C turning or appearing rusty? Wow, how long did it take to see results? Thanks for the rec! I just bought this yesterday to replace my Ole Henriksen Truth Serum. Hoping it works out! Have you tried the Cerave HA serum? Does anyone know where to buy the serum in Canada? how long until you saw change? Mine too! Haha! I was so disappointed with b. peroxide. It did absolutely nothing for my deep cystic acne except make my skin light sensitive so then I was not only pasty and spotty, but hissing at light and getting rashes  in the sun lmao. YAY! i hope it works as well for you as me !!!! I can speak to that as well. The foaming cerave cleanser irritated my skin but the non foaming one from cerave has been poifect. I tried the COSRX good morning cleanser but found it was still a little harsh for me so I went back to the non foaming cerave. 

Interested in trying that vitamin c serum from cerave now I didn't realize they had that in their line. It's too much for me. I use CeraVe hydrating (the one for normal to dry skin). It is much lighter Foaming cleansers can be very hit or miss especially if you have dry skin. 

I avoid them in general because I always find them irritating but I love the hydrating cleanser. I like the consistency more than cetaphil. you aren‚Äôt the first person to say that today!! this is my first time buying it and i love it. not sticky or oily at all, which have been the two comments i‚Äôve gotten. so whatever formula they have now is a million times better Omg do we get this in Canada?! I had no idea this existed Oh I am getting this tomorrow then. I have some issues on my forehead with pigmentation that needs some love Do you (or anyone) know if it would help with under eye circles? Does it pill or have a white cast? Do you use any make-up with it? I‚Äôm new here and hoping to compare it to CeraVe or some other sunscreen. Hoping to cover up the hyperpigmentation a little with make-up too to not be too self-conscious about my appearance as I‚Äôm treating it I just started a tret product at night so I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll be a lot but I will do anything to brighten my skin right now. Esp bc the tret is at night and the vit c is in the morning, it‚Äôll be ok right? As my skin burns off...lol Oh wow, that's so disappointing! It‚Äôs kinda like the super buff dude going to the gym for 6 hours a day and then posting how he eats pizza but is still in shape. 


If you have good skin you have good skin. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre not trying all this garbage. The biggest complaint I've seen (and personally experienced) is that CeraVe sunscreens pill like crazy. I also found they never dried down and left my face feeling tacky all day. or just do what tons of other people do and go AM - Niacinamide and PM - Vit C Awesome!! Thank you! I will be trying it out! Thank you! I've seen that your skin type is all around oily, so that's probably why the cleanser doesn't kill yours. SPF 50 is always better than SPF 30. I have the same skin type as you (acne, scars, etc.) and I used the cerave moisturizer with SPF. For me personally I didn‚Äôt lIke how it made my skin feel and it wasn‚Äôt moisturizing enough. It made my skin feel greasy and not hydrated well. Ok just wondering if you know something I don‚Äôt or REALLY love one of those products you have. I like the simplicity of just one product but then I still have a separate night time moisturizer so it ends up the same amount of products. :p Maybe I'll try it! Thank you! [deleted] Ooh now I'm interested to try it again. Thanks! Ah I‚Äôve been putting mine in the fridge inside the box. I‚Äôll try that and see if it works a bit better. I havent seen a huge change in my dark spots but I really like that I can go to a local store and pick this up. Super convenient Shitty ingredients, usually compromises your skins protective barrier. Also there‚Äôs no good SPF in this picture and SPF is the most important. And drugstore brands aren‚Äôt going to be cosmetically elegant, i.e. leave a white cast and be tacky, so people decide not to wear it. And SPF in moisturizers and foundations aren‚Äôt effective. I mean I went to school and spent thousands to do so. It would take a lot of time to break down ingredients. There‚Äôs websites you can throw a product or ingredient in and it will tell you why it‚Äôs hood or bad or neutral.  Like skincarisma dot com
I use professional skincare and it‚Äôs made with high quality, uncompromising ingredients. Not all brands focus on packaging. People refuse to really invest in their skin when they should be questioning why their brands are so cheap, aside from packaging. 
The best thing to do is find a professional esthetician in your area, most solo estheticians don‚Äôt charge as much as day spas. Get a facial and have them recommend. 
My routine also isn‚Äôt extensive. Some people need more, some people need less. Most important is cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. Exfoliation 2-3 times a week. And then you can add in serums if needed or wanted and a masque once a week. 
I‚Äôm not trying to be condescending, but people‚Äôs google research doesn‚Äôt outweigh professional education. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Fab fit fun. There will be a small icon on the box or bottle with something like a 6 or a 12 on it, sometimes a larger number, indicating months until expiration. Usually from the time of opening.

Also, sometimes actual expiration dates. I've had products that have a pungent smell when they turn, too.

Depending on the product or how your skin reacts you may breakout, get chemical burns or it won't work at all. for evening your skin tone! it lightens the scars I use this vitamin c serum just to give my skin a nice glow. Just wipe it off with a tissue- the tip isn‚Äôt actually effected. It is the serum being exposed to the light and air that changes its color. It isn‚Äôt harmful and the rest of the tube is still OK. I saw this with mine too and then I read on the package that discoloration can occur. no! how long have you had it when you noticed ? about a week before i really noticed ! about a week I used to have moderate acne, with some nasty and painful cysts that would pop up from time to time. I tried benzoyl peroxide too. It turned my skin from an oily mess to a dry, flaky, painful, red mess... and I was careful to use those products sparingly! It always burned my skin slightly when I would put it on. My dermatologist marked that I was allergic to it on my chart, so that I'd never have to deal with that again when treating my acne. Ah that sucks! It doesn't work for everyone but it works super well for many people. Definitely need to use it with SPF and an occlusive moisturizer, though. Yeah, the Foaming is much more drying. I have oily skin and still use the Hydrating one in the winter because of the lack of humidity. I only use the Foaming during the summer. OHHH now I understand why the Cetaphil foaming cleanser made my skin feel tight!! I have dry/combination skin, and I just switched to the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and I seriously think I'm in love!! My skin is unbelievably soft and smooth. Now I know to steer clear foaming cleansers, thank you for helping me realize this! Cerave website says its at my local shoppers as well as tons of other locations so hopefully! Ill see tomorrow and try to remember to report back Dont put harsh acids (like vitamin c) on your delicate eye skin!! Dark circles and veins showing 
Are not the same pigment problem as hyperpigmentation. Maybe try a good moistureizing eye cream and TO caffeine serum. im not 100% sure what you mean by pilling or having a white cast because i am pretty new to skin care terms but if you define them i can tell you :) i don‚Äôt use makeup at all though so i don‚Äôt know how that would make a difference I've definitely experienced that but it's never bothered me enough to deter me from using up my current bottle. Maybe when it's gone I'll try a different brand. Do you have any recommendations? all around did you miss the SPF 50 sunscreen in the picture ?? I totally understand that as I went to school and am paying off student loans. 

I‚Äôll check out the site! Thank you for the recommendation and the information you laid out. 

I see my esthetician every month ‚Äî she‚Äôs my angel! She has me trying out Epionce Lytic TX, and Epionce SPF and I‚Äôm really liking the SPF.

I can see how this sub could be frustrating from a esthetician/derm standpoint ‚Äî armchair experts telling others how to care for their skin. Usually, everyone has good intentions, peppered in with some snark and hive behavior. 

Explaining why a product isn‚Äôt good is a helpful contribution. 

Stating a product sucks can come across in a negative way because there‚Äôs no context for the reason of the comment. 

I agree our googling doesn‚Äôt make outweigh your professional education. I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre here!! Do you recommend it? Does it heal to even the skin tone? Like if I use it and stop would results stay? Meaning, would it help with rosacea redness blotchiness you suppose? That‚Äôs what I figured but I‚Äôd also emailed cerave and then never responded but I didn‚Äôt look it up much further cus I also had another vitamin c product i was trying to finish up anyway. A couple of weeks Yeah, I was careful to apply it lightly and only on active areas (which is hard when they basically give you a bingo dabber to work with). Nevermind! On to other options.. I have dry/combo as well, cerave hydrating is the best! The vitamin c isn't that great. I've been using it for 2.5 months and haven't noticed anything different. It did make me break out the first 2/3 weeks but I was using it every night. After I adjusted, my skin looks the same. I don't think it's strong enough or it's entry level. Once I'm done I'm trying something new Thank you! By pilling I sort-of mean not sinking into the skin too well, and sort-of just staying on top as an extra layer. I have this problem with other aveeno products, namely their moisturizers - I would apply make-up on top and realize it‚Äôs not applying like it usually does, then try to remove it and notice the moisturizer is coming off almost like lint off of clothes...

White cast is simpler - if the sunscreen is physical, as opposed to chemical, there‚Äôs a chance it leaves your face physically whiter. It won‚Äôt absorb into your skin - just looks like smudges on your face. I've been using Neutrogena Clear Face sunscreen for years and it's never given me any issues! It‚Äôs not a good one I said and it‚Äôs Aveeno which is also a shit brand. Also most of these brands aren‚Äôt cruelty free. Yes! I love it. I have very sensitive skin and there were only two products that bothered me in the year I had it. My husband was able to use the products I couldn't so it was a total win! 

It's not all skin care, but I usually chose the skin care options because that's what I'm into. I would probably try azelaic acid or niacinamide for rosacea It doesn‚Äôt help with rosacea, it lightens stuff like acne scars and freckles i haven‚Äôt noticed that. have you been keeping it in the box it comes in ? the packaging says it‚Äôs best to keep it in the box I just want to interject that what may not work for you can do wonders for others. i use my vitamin c serum every morning and it‚Äôs helping me immensely. i wouldn‚Äôt discourage anyone from trying anything unless there‚Äôs a legitimate reason that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt work for me so it‚Äôs not that great‚Äù oh okay! well i tend to make sure that i really rub it into my skin so that there‚Äôs no excess (gently though obviously) and if you don‚Äôt rub it in then it can leave a white cast, but if you make sure to then no not at all, and i use a liberal amount. it definitely sinks into the skin and i don‚Äôt know if this is because i don‚Äôt use makeup but i‚Äôve never had a problem with it pilling if i have to wipe it off wow this is remarkably rude and not helpful. :) you could take your bad attitude and ‚Äúesthetician‚Äù credentials elsewhere :) That's cool! I'll definitely check it out. Thank you <3 Tell me more!  All I use is cerave cleanser and moisturizer...that's it. But I'd like to add one more product that's easy. I need this as I am a freaky freckly gal.  My freckles are starting to merge on my face :( does it lighten little freckle/moles too? i have two moles that i adore on my face and don‚Äôt want to lose :) I keep it stored upright in a dark cabinet. It's normal! Mine always does it, the box said it would likely occur. The serum itself can also get slightly orange in color. Yea agreed. Everyone is different. People on this sub like to say what they like but most people don't spend the time to say it was a waste. Not my intention but it is the truth. Drug store products are loaded with ingredients that are horrible for skin. Especially ones sold in America. Europe has banned hundreds of ingredients the United States still uses. Vitamin c is really good and effective at lightening sun damage and discoloration from acne, but from what I understand it doesn't work well for rosacea redness and can be quite irritating (I don't have rosacea but had a hard time finding vitc that didn't sting my skin). But here is some info on azelaic acid from someone who knows lots more than I do! 

https://simpleskincarescience.com/azelaic-acid/ Me too! I use Klairs vitamin C treatment and it did wonders. They come back fully if I stop using it/get too much sun but it‚Äôs so great. I nearly got to have the clear complexion I dreamt of as a kid. I don‚Äôt think it lightens moles, it doesn‚Äôt on me but I‚Äôm not positive. Could you tell me what vitamin c product is not irritating you? Cause I am facing the same problem. Wow!  Thank you.  I'll look into that product.  Currently I am using Ole Henriksen Truth Serum Collagen Booster and it seems to be working!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I fucking love dove bar soap and I use it on my face in the shower. Its so moisturizing and I havnt had a problem with it so I'm not going to stop using it.

It also single handedly cleared up my bacne when I twitched to Dove, where every salycylic acid body and BP cream failed me.

Anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't understand dove soap. Its A) NOT actually soap, thats why it says beauty bar. So all the things about "soap" are not relevant to doves formulation, B) its low ph balanced at around ph 6, which is FAR better for your skin than most commercial body washes at 7 or even 8 and C) actually moisturizing There are plenty of people who use Dove bar soap on their face and it works fine for them. I‚Äôve used the fragrance free one on my face before and my skin is fine. I didn‚Äôt find it to be any more stripping than your basic foaming liquid cleanser. Idk why some people act like it‚Äôs using battery acid or something on your face. So refreshing to see a simple and cost effective routine. No hate, but as a broke student, the long product lists here are discouraging. Love this! I have a similar routine. I use the dove sensitive, adapalene, cerave in the tub and Elta md physical. If you‚Äôre looking for a good sunscreen for sensitive skin I would definitely recommend it! Hey now I want to try dove on my face! I‚Äôm oily and acne prone too. It sure would be cheaper if it works. How have you maintained this regimen AND your membership in this group?? I once had a simple routine, now I‚Äôm doing bi-weekly order pickups on random things. I also love the dove bar soap! I‚Äôve never tried it on my face, but I LOVE Dove bar soap for my body. It doesn‚Äôt leave a film like a lot of soaps do and it actually feels ‚Äúmoisturizing‚Äù like their body wash. 

You should definitely think about adding daily SPF because you‚Äôre using tret. It really sensitizes your skin to the sun and can cause more harm than good in the long run if you don‚Äôt protect yourself properly! 

EDIT: to be a bit clearer, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre wearing hats and all of that and honestly if you weren‚Äôt on tret, I‚Äôd honestly be like ‚Äúokay, that‚Äôs great!‚Äù But because you are using tret you have to be extra careful. I feel like you've gotten an insane amount of backlash for saying you don't regularly wear sunscreen...despite the fact you've literally explained in multiple comments why.

It's your business, and your dermatologist's business, and as long as they're okay with it is all that matters.

Yeah, sunscreen is important, but you know your skin and what works best, and something not talked a lot about on this sub imo is affordability of skincare products, esp a lot of the Korean sunscreens a lot of people are recommending, for example. 

It's EXPENSIVE, and for a lot of people spending that money on skincare doesn't make much sense when there are much more important expenses...especially, as you say if you're a student on a budget. Even the 'cheaper' ones are like ~$15 which is a lot of money? 

And I'm not hating on anyone at all if you spend money on skincare - that's great! You do you. Just adding a little perspective that not everyone can always afford to spend that kinda money. 

Also, I do think sunscreen is important, but there is something to be said about our ancestors having lived in a time where sunscreen wasn't a thing and, hey, they turned out okay. And of course, genetics plays a role too. 

Just wanted to send you some positivity <3 ‚ÄúDOVE SOAP AND NO SPF? BURN THE WITCH‚Äù

Okay but srs if my doc says I can use that soap on my hoo haa it wont destroy my face

I do suggest like a spf moisturizer if youre going to be outside a lot bc i know prescription medicines for the face sometimes hate the sun Nice! I like the simplicity and functionality of this routine. I'm happy you found something that works well for you. This hits home for me. I used the same dove soap and cerave sunscreen religiously while on spironolactone to cure my severe acne. Works for some people, doesn‚Äôt work for others and both are okay! **About me:**

18F

Living in semi-continental climate: warm/hot humid summers (up to 35 degC or 95 degF) and a cold dry winter (dropping to -15 degC or 5 degF)

Eat pretty healthy (no/very very little dairy, low junk foods/fried foods/candy)

Wear minimal makeup: just brows, eyeliner and mascara on the daily. Concealer rarely if I happen to have a red spot on an important day or need to look more glam for an event. 

**About my skin:** 

Very oily

Not at all sensitive

Very prone to breakouts on forehead/ temples/upper cheeks, not prone to hormonal/period breakouts.

Rarely burns, tans very fast, skin tone is a 3 on the fitz scale but skin reacts (and eyes/hair are) like a 5.

**My skin concerns:**

Breakout prevention, general skin health

**My routine:** 

AM - Wash face with Dove Bar Soap (lol before you come for me, read below!), moisturize with a penny-sized amount of CeraVe Tub Cream (yes I don't wear sunscreen regularly, I'll explain why -- please be nice lol)

PM - Wash face with Dove Bar Soap, leave my face slopping wet while I brush my teeth, blot face dry and apply Tretinoin prescription, let that sink in a little bit and apply penny-sized amount of CeraVe Tub Cream

**Product reviews + Why I use them/don't use them:**

Dove Bar Soap: Hear me out! I know that most bar soaps are super drying and have a pH that is too high for our skin but this one is not drying at all. If you have dry skin it might be drying for you but I have oily skin so it's perfect for me. I can't stand gel/milky/cream cleansers. They all feel so heavy and just too rich for me. Foaming cleansers only for me. This soap lathers perfectly between rich and light. I like to massage my face while I have the slip from the soap. If I happened to wear extra makeup or sunscreen that day I will cleanse twice with the soap. After rinsing off, my face does not feel tight or dry at all! Also, I would highly recommend this soap as a hand soap if you don't want to use it on your face! Esp since I've been washing my hands a lot more than usual these months, I find that this one does not dry my hands out like other liquid foaming/gel soaps! Plus it's super affordable, you can get a huge pack at Costco. I have a pet peeve for pricey cleansers, you're literally washing money down the drain lol but that's just my opinon not an attack on anyone!

CeraVe Tub Cream: Ah the HG of this sub haha. It's the best, what can I say. Even though I have oily skin and this cream is labeled as for normal-dry (my skin is def oily and not normal), this cream works amazing. I actually don't like gel/watery creams despite having oily skin. I just find that I have to use such a large amount of the lotion and since these types of lotions usually come in dainty little jars already, I think it's a waste of money. I'd rather use a scant amount of a thicker cream like this one. Luckily, this cream is not at all greasy and absorbs in very nicely (when I use a small amount) and doesn't not feel heavy or break me out. I would recommend trying even if you have oily skin. Just use a very small amount. The texture is great and it spreads wonderfully which makes using a small amount super easy to do. This is a 540g tub and it was what I would consider sort of pricey but well worth it, it lasts forever. Additionally, a thicker cream is more versitile for my climate. Our winters are dry and harsh so I will use more in the winter and less during the humid summers.

Lack of sunscreen: Okay hear me out, I'm not crazy I swear! I only wear sunscreen when I plan to spend a ton of time outside i.e. hiking, gardening, running, beach, picnic etc. Even then I will try to plan these activities during a time when the UV index is low (0-2, 3 max), and if the UV index is 0-1, I won't wear sunscreen. I never sunbath or deliberately try to tan. When walking around outside I will wear a hat and use a umbrella to provide me with portable shade. I am well aware of the dangers of skin cancer and hyperpigmentation (esp for my fitz scale number) but the issue is that I haven't found a sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast, is thin/non-greasy, doesn't break me out, and is accessible/affordable. I realize that there are probably asian sunscreens that fufill almost all these criteria but they aren't accessible/affordable and unfourtunately every one of those critera are a must. I'm a student and my budget is very tight, therefore my definition of affordable is likely a lot lower than yours. Additionally, I have oily skin and sunscreen just feels so uncomfortable and yucky. I just feel that the cons outweight the pros, esp since I've taken other actions to outweigh the cons a bit. 

Tretinoin: The best and seriously the only active I will ever use I swear! Not only is it completely science-backed (I am a health science/human biology major so I love some properly backed info) but it deals with everything I could want to treat: breakouts, pigmentation and anti-aging for the future. With the way my insurance covers it, it's "free" for me, but even if I paid out of pocket it would only cost me $20 CAD or $15 USD. The 30g lasts me 8 months of using everyday. Yes I use Tret everyday. Before you freak out, my skin is very NOT sensitive. Even when I started Tret for the first time, I had barely any peeling/redness/flaking. I use Tret on slightly damp skin too and I have no issues at all. In fact, I find it works better for me when my skin is slightly damp. I love my tube of Tret to death!

Lack of exfoliation: I don't physically exfoliate because St.Ives = bad and I've wanted to try the TO Glycolic Toner to chemically exfoliate but it's sold out everywhere all the time. However, I do sort of exfoliate because Tret "loosens" the top dead layer of my skin (as it turns over) and in the shower with some slip from water, I'll rub my face gently and my dead skin will sort of pill up and come off (gross, I'm sorry but it's true). I think this is enough exfoliation but I still want to try the TO Glycolic toner when I can get my hands on it. 

Whoops, sorry that was a long one. Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. Sending clear skin vibes in everyone's way!!! I've heard so many good things about the Dove soap, but I've always been hesitant to try it-- I def need to give it a shot it would be way more affordable than the stuff I currently use. Hey this is kinda a random question, but how do you store your dove soap? I use it in the shower for my body, and I want to start using it for my face too. Do you have a special tray for your soap for your face? Or am I just being silly? lmao 140 comments over a 3 product routine, of course

I used dove soap in college and that‚Äôs probably when my skin was at its best. If it works, it works. you won‚Äôt do any ‚Äúanti aging‚Äù without wearing sunscreen. i somewhat understand your reasonings but UVA rays are still out even when the UV index is low. tretinoin isn‚Äôt going to help with any anti aging if you‚Äôre getting sun damage everyday. regardless of what you say the pros of wearing sunscreen will always outweigh the cons. I love that dove soap!  Although I don‚Äôt use it anymore when I was around 18 I was on birth control and over the course of a few months I randomly got a flair up of acne that came out of nowhere. I had no clue what to do and was trying different things and nothing was working and finally that dove soap helped me when nothing else did! Yes! I love your simple routine.  I kinda dislike these shelfies with 10 products that cost $500 and take an hour to go through a fancy routine every day. Sometimes less is more! I love Dove. hell yes dove sensitive bars! holy grail Is the Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash the same ingredients as the sensitive skin beauty bar? Because I've used both, but man, that body wash is amazing. Only thing that works for me besides the now-discontinued CeraVe Eczema Body Cleanser. RIP old friend, but you didn't come in a massive 34oz bottle like the Dove does. I've seriously been working on that bottle for 6 months now üëç Dove is the best I really do believe that people‚Äôs skin are just different and the people who use Dove bar and have it work effectively for them, is just way down the other side of the spectrum ‚Äî same for other fragranced, chemicalled products. Their skin just take it better Compliments on your lighting and positioning. I would've thought this is an ad! Hey, I love how gentle and minimal your routine is! I am a big fan of Dove bar soap for my body and face. If you want to work up to chemical exfoliants, you can start with TO Lactic Acid before Glycolic. I use a lot of chemical exfoliants but I find their Glycolic to be kind of aggressive sometimes. Exactly as me. Nice routine!  I guarantee your skin is doing better than half the people piling on you in this thread for not obsessing over spf. Is it hard to get a retin a rx from a normal family physician? Your routine is pretty similar to mine. I also am constrained by budget due to being in school, and it was nice to find a routine that I could afford!! I love dove bar soap, I have sensitive and dry skin and this is one of the few cleansers that won't strip all the oil from my face and leave me feeling drier than the Sahara. I love natural soap and I think most people can source a local maker.  Always check ph levels.  I have been working with skin for 15 years now, I totally think if it‚Äôs working roll with it! My mom switched to Dove when Sweatheart was discontinued. MANY people use bar soap with no ill effects. I wash my face with Dove soap as well!! It works so well to take makeup off and doesn‚Äôt make me too dry, except maybe sometimes in the winter This is the exact routine my dermatologist recommend for me! Except the Cerave lotion (not cream)! It's been great and has *mostly* cleared up my acne but has took a long time, she told me I would have to be patient. Now working on these pesky closed comedones! I love how simple and affordable your routine is! üòçI am lowkey going to copy your routine a bit since my old routine was pricey (and I can't continue it anymore). Thanks for sharing your routine, OP! I wish I lived somewhere retin-a was affordable for me. I use the dove on my body, but I honestly never thought to try it on my face. I might need to test it out! I used a dove bar for years and always had compliments on my skin! I still use it if I‚Äôm having a breakout or reaction and it always brings things back to normal. It was the only thing that worked when I was pregnant and developed little bumps all over my face [deleted] Where u from Looking at these comments I‚Äôm scared to say I have been using Dial for the las 10 years lol.  And ponds lotion only lol that has been my two step skincare till now. 
I‚Äôm looking into something to help with some dark areas around my mouth. i know I'm basically beating a dead horse but omfg i love dove. out of all the skincare products that i own, my one true HG product will be always be dove. back when I was in high school, i had incredibly horrid acne. whenever i use dove on my face, it literally felt like my acne was disappearing. it didn't help brighten my acne scars but it was so good for clearing acne. My only gripe with Dove bar soaps or non-soap beauty bars it their packaging. While it looks like paper it's more than that. It's lined with a thin plastic film on the inside, rendering it essentially non-recyclable. They're supposed to change that by the end of 2020 but I'll believe it when I see it. I also use them on my body because they don't exacerbate dryness for me, hopefully they change the packaging sooner rather than later. And even then, it might take a bit longer until the change trickles down to in-store shelves. I saw your spf related comment and I just wanted to recommend the cerave moisturiser with spf 25. It‚Äôs not pricey and if you already enjoy the cerave cream it might be a good fit for you! I absolutely love it and so does my sister and my dad! Where did you find that tub of CeraVe? Aah!! Where‚Äôd you get the pump for the Cerave cream?? I hate digging my fingers into mine! Is the tret prescription from a derm? Where did you find that gigantic tub of Cerave? The biggest I‚Äôve found with the pump is 539g at [shoppers](https://beauty.shoppersdrugmart.ca/Beauty/Categories/Skin-Care/Hand-%26-Body-Care/Moisturizing-Cream/p/BB_3606000531673?variantCode=3606000531673)!! Canadian ? The cerave cream made me break out all over in closed comedowns ;( I‚Äôm still recovering from that Dove bar soap is my favorite cleanser! And we use the same concentration of retin-a, that‚Äôs funny My mom swears by the Pears transparent  soap bars I‚Äôve never tried cerave but it seems to be a part of everyone‚Äôs routine I love dove for the body, havent used on my face more than oops I have nothing else, because I prefer something unscented. But I hear it works for many, which is nice as a soap bar is less plastic and easier to travel with. Thank you! I‚Äôll check with the doc. Just missing an SPF. How do you like that Retin-A, I just haven‚Äôt found one that seems to do anything. Also is 5% the highest you can get without a prescription?

Nice simple and clean routine you have there. I wish people would tell you to go out more instead of staying indoors so much. Instead they are lecturing you on sunscreen.  Vitamin d deficiency is very negatively affecting people 
 You need at least 10 minutes of direct sun exposure everyday. Thank you for posting a realistic, personal routine that you do. I am so done with seeing TO and Cerave. Both companies broke me out, definitely looking into the Dove bar! WHERE IS THE SUNSCREEN? Damn cerave burns my tret skin and dove soap gives me eczema on my face. Now you just need a sunscreen and your done. Is that some sort of generic Tretinoin? Where did you get it and how much did it cost? I have Apostrophe but it's been costing me a pretty penny How did you get the retin-a? Over the counter or derm? If over the counter, from where?? I use Curology but it‚Äôs expensive and I‚Äôm looking for an alternative. What is your skin type? Where'd you get the retin-A? So a question. Do you have to go to the dermatologist to get the prescription on tretinoin cream? Just want to know that retin-A is better than benzoyl peroxide cream for acne? Have you been seeing improvement with retin A 0,05% ? I started using it daily about 2,5 weeks ago but haven‚Äôt seen much difference. Lol valeant Uses a prescription skin care product but won‚Äôt pay for a sunscreen lol. Check out Netflix ‚ÄúDirty Money‚Äù episode about Valeant pharmaceuticals. They‚Äôre evil. They also own CeraVe which is a huge bummer because I like their products.

Edit: Valeant sold CeraVe to L‚ÄôOreal in 2017. I‚Äôll have to check to see if they pass the Buycott test! The valeant company is very corrupt! You should watch the documentary on Netflix Awesome, glad it works for you too! After my derm told me I have dyshidrotic eczema on my hands, she recommended dove sensitive bar soap and it is a lifesaver, I use it on everything: hands, face, body. It‚Äôs amazing. I guess I don't understand Dove.  It dries me out which is so weird. And the company tests on animals. My mom loved it too. Yes! I looked up the pH of common bar soaps a while ago because my ex used Irish Spring and it gave me a wicked rash. I was shocked to see so many bars having a pH of 10 and that dove had a pH of 6. This is interesting... I started breaking out on my shoulders, upper back and upper arms every summer a few years ago and that‚Äôs around the time I switched from Dove to dr bronners. I‚Äôll need to test switch back and test it out The beauty bar cleared up my bacne too, it was a miracle I have been using Dove sensitive skin (the pink one) for  2-3 years. It never dried me out like other beauty bars do. It's cheaper and works so I love it. I dont know why, dove bar made me break out like crazy, that breakout got me into skincare because the effects stayed for like 4 months at least people on this thread just love to be dogmatic about things they‚Äôve never tired....one youtuber says that bar soap is bad and ppl start losing their mind over a dove bar. I think it comes from lumping dove soap with other bar soaps which are def very very drying. I suppose people just assume that they are all the same, an easy assumption to make to be honest. Their moisturized bar soaps have treated me well for over a decade now.  Huge fan.  Used to annoy my ex who was big into skincare, but she couldn't argue with results. My cousin studied Medicine at one of the best training hospitals in our country. The Outpatient Department is full of poor people who are being treated by resident doctors for very low fees. He told me that the general rule of thumb when recommending a budget facial cleanser is Dove Bar Soap for dry skin and Ivory Bar Soap for oily skin. I didn't really believe him at first, but I tried out Ivory and I've been using it for the past 4 years now. It works wonderfully on my oily af skin. This is coming from someone who's tried out a bunch of "gentle" cleansers before like Cerave and Cetaphil. Honestly, people need to try something out first before condemning it. If my cousin hadn't convinced me to try it out, I would have never found out that the $1 bar soap would work better for me than the $15 pump bottle cleanser. *Soap* is bad for your skin; the high pH disrupts the acid mantle and will mess up your skin like nothing else (I still have PIH from using a high pH cleanser in December last year). But Dove Beauty Bar is not soap, it's a syndet bar (synthetic detergent bar) and no more damaging for the skin than a liquid cleanser. Considering that you're not paying for a bunch of water and they can be packaged in non-plastic packaging, probably more cost effective and better for the environment too.

Here's some more info on syndets: [https://www.stephensonpersonalcare.com/blog/2014-12-09-soap-vs-syndet](https://www.stephensonpersonalcare.com/blog/2014-12-09-soap-vs-syndet) Dove soap is the only thing I can use on my body that doesn‚Äôt cause itching Yeah I‚Äôm getting electrolysis and my aesthetician said that if I must use a cleanser (she insists I use witch hazel which I do but I don‚Äôt like using it as frequently as they recommend since I find it drying), then I should use Dove sensitive skin soap (which isn‚Äôt really made of real soap) instead. I use that (unscented) bar on my face every morning and night. Sometimes in between too, if necessary. My skin loves it :) [deleted] My mom has washed her face with the pink bar for years and has a pretty minimal routine and her skin looks very good for approaching 60. 

I guess because I had such severe acne as a teen, I always used acne-geared face washes (clean & clear mostly, it was the 90s, we didn‚Äôt know any better).  Now I oil cleanse and use LRP. Maybe I‚Äôll try out a Dove bar. Seeing everyone rave about the dove beauty bar really makes me want to try it. If only I hadn‚Äôt just bought a refill of my expensive cleanser. I find dove beauty bar leaves a film on my face that feels drying. But I love that it‚Äôs still a thing that works for so many people. I love affordable skin care gems that work. Ponds rejuveness night cream is my holy grail and it‚Äôs like $9 for 14 oz. Same. My skin has never felt or looked better since I started using Dove. I was skeptical but it works very well for me. It's my HG. My grandmother swore by dove soap bars on her face. She had great skin into her 80s. My mom had incredibly sensitive skin and dove soap was pretty much the only thing she used for her whole life.  Personally I found it too drying, but my mom always had perfect skin and she didn‚Äôt even use moisturizer I think it's because people think it's a traditional bar of soap which has a very basic ph. Dove beauty bar still has a higher ph than a lot of cleansers, but it's neutral at 7 which is more basic than our skins ph. It's one of those things that work for some and not for others. I can use it on my body but not my face.

Edit-After reading what I wrote, I realized I misspoke about most cleansers having a lower ph. A lot of companies are making cleansers with gentler surfacants at a lower ph, but there are still a lot that are basic. Lol battery acid... that gave me a good chuckle I agree. I probably have like 10 products but I‚Äôm cheap af and most of it comes from the drug store. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever stepped foot in a Sephora. 

Drugstore products can be really good too and if it works for your skin, it works for your skin. To be honest I feel like some of the people posting shelfies here are doing it as a flex... Thanks for the rec! Dove does the trick for me. The key to oily skin is moisture. The oil is usually a sign of skin compensating for moisture. I'm not a doctor but that was my experience. Try out some products that are for very dry skin. I would recommend it. If it doesn‚Äôt, you could always use it as normal hand soap! Hahaha it‚Äôs easier when you don‚Äôt have the money to spend lol!üòù Since lurking this sub I've tried a few new things but always return to my old faithfuls. I'm starting to think that doing the same thing everyday is more important than the actual stuff you use. I love it too!! So glad to see others that use this on their face. It worked better than any other cleanser I tried. Same! It's the only cleanser without actives that I've found actually helps my breakouts! Awesome! I‚Äôm glad it works for you too! I appreciate your concern! I just personally find that the pros don‚Äôt outweigh the cons for me, this includes other things that I didn‚Äôt mention because the comment was getting too long. When my budget is not as restrained I‚Äôm looking to try the Supergoop Unseen sunscreen as I heard great things about it, it‚Äôs just too pricey for me right now!


Edit: To clarify: I just don‚Äôt wear sunscreen every single day, that‚Äôs all. Due to the nature of my job/school/studying etc I spend almost all my time indoors! I‚Äôm not going to reapply sunscreen (because if it‚Äôs only part of AM routine it‚Äôll be ineffective by noon) every couple of hours when I‚Äôm on my laptop/in a lecture hall mostly. I‚Äôm not anti-sun protection. Additionally, I live in the city. The amount of sun that I‚Äôm exposed to is really very little due to the buildings as well (this is on top of wearing a hat, using an umbrella and choosing low UV times of day). Not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted... actually I do know why. Remember that I know my skin and my situation best please, strangers of the internet. Thank you so much for the kind comment. I wholeheartedly agree with everything you mentioned. I appreciate your words, cheers! I laughed at this comment because I literally use that soap for my hoo ha! Only thing that doesn‚Äôt give me weird infections down there TMI Thanks! Glad to hear it helped you! It seems that your routine is working well for you and you've made up your mind, but I would still recommend you use a daily sunscreen - especially since you use Tret every night. Tret makes your skin more sensitive to the sun, so by not wearing sunscreen regularly, you may be effectively cancelling out the anti-aging properties of Tret. I don't think you should fear the sun like many SCAs joke about, but I do think a daily sunscreen is a wise choice. If you don't care about photoaging and are just using the tretinoin to get rid of zits and prevent breakouts, then i suppose SPF isn't that important. 

However, if general skin health is your concern, finding an SPF should be a priority, well before you start considering introducing actives. Ulta has TO glycolic acid and lactic acid available! If there‚Äôs one near you or if you wanna shop online, there‚Äôs a 20% coupon rn. I think you mentioned the supergoop sunscreen in another comment - but neutrogena clear face is a same consistency! CeraVe also has this ‚Äúultra light‚Äù sunscreen that might be of interest. Oh and the eucerin daily hydration sunscreen (in a tube) sinks in the skin like lotion :) highly recommend the eucerin one, but it‚Äôs not super water resistant :/ If you are in UK or EU, the ordinary has a very affordable glycolic acid toner. It is I think 6 E and will last you maybe over a year.   
I know your budget might not fit it, but I like the Purito sunscreen, they have both chemical(centella) and physical (water comfort) they doesn't leave a white cast, it is nor greasy at all as is water based and have niacinamide to control oil. You can find it on sale for 15 E (lasts about 4-5 months if you are not going out for sun much), but add the shipping can be more depending on the page, what I do is order with friends, so we have a shared buy and share the shipping, might be an option if not now for the future. Target has some nice sunscreens under their Up&Up Brand. I use the Sport 50 and its really creamy and light This might be a dumb question... but how do you get a prescription for Retina-A? Do I need to go to a dermatologist for it? And do I need a good reason, like does my skin need to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù enough to get a prescription? 

I currently use some cream with retinol in it. My face looks mostly ok, but my forehead is no where close to smooth and my tone all over isn‚Äôt good. I‚Äôm wondering if using tretinoin instead would help. I would recommend it! If it doesn't work out, you could always use it as a hand soap or body wash! I use it as a body wash more. Just for that, its worth it. Face i think is hit or miss but i don't know a single person whose body didn't appreciate it I use bar soap as well and I just bought a little travel case. Keeps my soap separate in the shower and lets me toss it in a gym bag quick. Also keeps my shower from getting soap scum build up Haha not silly at all. I sort of have a (slightly neurotic) sequence that I follow which I will try to explain. I use the same soap bar for face, hands, and body. Firstly, before I cleanse my face I always wash my hands with the soap. And as I‚Äôm finishing rinsing off my hands I rinse the soap bar too. Basically I think this effectively takes a layer off the bar revealing a ‚Äúclean‚Äù layer underneath. When using the bar as body wash, I will always later it in my hands first before putting it anywhere else. And at the end of every shower, I‚Äôll rinse the bar and the tray too to keep it clean and germ free. I think this very last step is really important! Hope this was clear! Yeah... I had nooo idea. I don‚Äôt see where they said anti-aging was a primary goal of theirs. I appreciate your concern! I just personally find that the pros don‚Äôt outweigh the cons for me, this includes other things that I didn‚Äôt mention because the comment was getting too long. When my budget is not as restrained I‚Äôm looking to try the Supergoop Unseen sunscreen as I heard great things about it, it‚Äôs just too pricey for me right now!

Not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted... actually I do know why. Remember that I know my skin and my situation best please, strangers of the internet. I'm so glad to hear! Thanks, and happy cake day! Hell yes for sure! Not sure... but I'd imagine they are slightly different since one is a solid while the other is a liquid, that ought to mess with the concentrations of stuff. Wow, I'm glad you found something that works so well for you! Haha thanks! Thanks for the warning! Glad it works for you too! Thanks haha. I do have my ethnicity and family genetics on my side... not saying this is an excuse not to wear sunscreen though. I just also happen to have other health issues that complicates things. So it's not as simple as not wearing sunscreen = bad. I think it depends on where you‚Äôre from. My family doc gave me a referral to see a derm with whom I talked to. So not directly from my family doc. Not sure where you‚Äôre from but as a Canadian perspective, I was easily able to get skin prescriptions from my doctor. Didn‚Äôt need a derm referral. Oh wow and it works for dry skin too? Awesome, so happy to hear! Glad to hear it works so well for you! Glad to hear it's helping you. Stay with it, you'll get there! Cheers! I'm sorry to hear. That being said, tret is technically an "extra" (affordable or not) and a basic routine of just cleansing and moisturizing will take you a long way (provided you don't have any other health issues). My mum (who is 51) only cleanses with whatever is on sale at the grocery store and who only moisturizes with whatever is on sale at the grocery store looks amazing for her age. Literally not a single wrinkle on her. Perhaps she is just lucky but even then, it goes to show that it is at least possible. Cheers! :) So happy to hear that it works for you! Congrats on the pregnancy, I hope everything went smoothly! Happy to hear if works for you too! Canada Hahaha well you must super non-finicky skin then! But seriously, my mum is the same. She uses just whatever lotion and whatever cleanser is on sale at the grocery store and she looks great for her age, all things considered. Best of luck treating the darkness around your mouth! So glad to hear that it works wonders for you! I know... but I still think it‚Äôs better than bottles and bottles of face wash/hand soap/body wash, right? Because this replaces all three for me! Thanks for the rec! I've tried the spf30 one (I've never seen a spf25 one?) actually and found the formulation to be really weird, it was too greasy and broke me out unfortunately. It was at my local Walmart but I'm not from the US so I don't know if they sell that size where you are. It was $28 CAD or $21 USD It came with a pump! Sorry I can‚Äôt help you here! Yes Ah a fellow Canadian ;). Mine is 539g as well, sorry for the confusion. I got it from Walmart for $28 CAD. How much is it at Shoppers? Oops I just saw you linked it, my bad! Yes Oh no. I'm sorry to hear, that must have been such a let down! Wishing you a speedy recovery! Happy to hear that it works for you too! Glad they work for her! I don't think that brand is sold where I'm from. I've heard it works for some people (perhaps the majority?) but not others! The Dove soap bars come in a variety of scents including the "sensitive skin" version which is unscented! I have a separate comment detailing my skin type/my enviroment/me etc and my thoughts about my products but it's probably buried at this point so I'll just retype here: it works great for me! It might just be my skin type (oliy, not at all sensitive) but I have no peeling/redness/flaking etc using tret. Not even when I first started. It truly is a miracle worker for me. 0.05% is not the highest strength. This brand also makes a 0.1% and a 0.025%. They also make a gel formulation (mines is a cream formulation). This is the generic brand that my insurance covers so I'm not sure about other name brands! It is a fine balance that me, my family doc and my derm have discussed. It is disappointing to see that certain people in this sub can't seem to realize that for me, it's not as simple as: not wearing sunscreen = bad. Vit d deficiency and all the issues that can come with it are indeed very serious, thank you for understanding and for recognizing this! I appreciate it! I hope it works for you! Aw man, just goes to show that different things work for different people. Best of luck with your skin, and I hope you've found things that work for you! The brand is considered generic in the country I‚Äôm from (Canada). I got it prescribed from my derm but to see a derm I had to get a rec from from family doc. It might be different for you, I have no idea! Best of luck finding an alternative! I don't think tret is available otc in US or Canada (where I'm from). I got it from a derm/family doc. I'm pretty dang oily. I have a separate comment that talks about my skin/me/my enviroment etc and my review/thoughts of these products! It's a prescription that I got from my family doc/derm! I'm from Canada and both family docs and derms can prescribe it. Might be different if you're from US, I'm not sure. I've never tried BP, sorry. Though I've heard it's very drying. Best of luck finding something that works! I've been using my tret for over a year now, so I'm more so in the "maintenance" phase now. But in the beginning when I had more problematic skin, there was a big different but over a period of a month or two. I've heard that it takes up to two months to see results from tret so keep it up! 2.5 weeks is much too short of a time to notice a visible difference (depending on how severe your issues where to begin with). Stick with it and one day you'll look back and realize how far you've come! Regular selfies using the same lighting and progress can help track your progress, best of luck! I‚Äôm missing the joke I think My prescription was completely covered by insurance, so basically free lol. Pretty sure L'Or√©al owns CeraVe I'd hate to support an evil company (I try to shop from Amazon as little as possible too) but this is the generic brand that is covered by my insurance so I can't "shop around". I don't have a Netflix account but I'm sure that the episode was very insightful. Oh no! :( I‚Äôd hate to support a company like that but I don‚Äôt have the choice to ‚Äúshop around‚Äù. This is the generic brand that is covered by my insurance :( [removed] This is the first I‚Äôve heard of using this for eczema and I can‚Äôt wait to try this on my hands. Especially now that I am washing my hands more than ever. It's a 3-in-1 for me too haha! Glad it works for you! I just wanted to say thank you so so much. I bought this as soon as I read your comment, and it has saved my hands in less than 24 hours. I had no idea how hydrating this could be. I was to the point where I was doing a literally 10 step skincare routine on my hands to try and get my cuticles back on some fingers, as it was so dry my nail beds were receding. THANK YOU! > And the company tests on animals.


[Thankfully, I don't think that's true anymore! ](https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/about-dove/no-animal-testing.html) Yeah it makes the skin on my body feel tight :/ Wait I thought dove was cruelty free? Last time I tried it (because my mother also loves it), my skin instantly started peeling and it took over a week to get somewhat back to normal. I won't touch it for anything now, but I know so many people love it. Skin is so individual. I also didn't use it for the testing. But I am glad to say they are moving towards being cruelty free =\] It‚Äôs funny how people will overlook this comment about this product being tested on animals, but a video of a person hurting an animal would result in outrage Real soaps have a pH of 8-10, the dove beauty bar is not soap, is a detergent bar. Not saying either is better or worse, just different things. I hope it goes well! Best of luck! That‚Äôs what I used growing up, my dad swears by it üòÇ this is making me consider going back to it Oh no, I'm sorry to hear. I hope you're able to get it cleared up asap! Old ladies have been using Dove bars foreverrrrrrrr. My great grandma swore by them. They‚Äôre popular for a reason, they‚Äôre gentle and effective Don‚Äôt even mention St. Ives... Tell me about it. Notwithstanding that dove beauty bar isn‚Äôt truly a soap, a LOT of people can use like real soap soap on their face and be just fine. People on this sub forget that if you have really easygoing skin, a lot of the so called ‚Äúrules‚Äù of skincare really don‚Äôt apply. I love my CeraVe moisturizing bar wash. It's brilliant and affordable. The only time I‚Äôm not broken out is when I give up and use dove unscented beauty bars.... 

It‚Äôs my anecdotal experience but it‚Äôs the only
Thing I‚Äôve gotten to work Haha, awesome! So happy to hear it works for you! Yay for affordability and yay for recognizing that for some, even other drugstore brands can be too pricey for what it is! Which ivory bar do you use? Hi, can you tell from where to buy both of these in India because I've burnt a hole in my pocket by buying gentle cleansers. The pH of the sensitive skin dove bar is also pretty comparable to liquid face cleansers IIRC. Like 5 or 6ish on the scale? Worth noting it still has saponified oils, so it does have soap in it, as well as synthetic detergents like SLI. What‚Äôs PIH? Great points, thanks for sharing! Yep explained it right people might think its working now but along the way you‚Äôll see the damage! Best of luck with your treatment! Not sure why as a aesthetician, she'd recommend using witch hazel when there's much better/gentler options. Witch hazel should be used sparingly, if not at all because it's distilled in ~14% [alcohol](https://www.americandistilling.com/witch-hazel-usp-specification/). Yes its good on body but not ideal on face in my opinionü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Awesome, glad it works for her! Last i heard, the sensitive skin beauty bar is a ph of 6. Do you mean lower pH? Second that, please use SPF if using retinol or other actives. I already have it for my body, so I‚Äôm definitely going to try it! Haha well with no traveling, barely any dining out, no day activities (like zoos, aquariums, etc.) and no daycare costs I have a little extra these days. Granted I‚Äôm not running out to do Nordstrom and Sephora pickups, more like Ulta and Target! I fell down the ordinary rabbit hole and my horrible budgeting mind is all ‚Äúyou would have spent this on lunch if you were working in office.‚Äù 

... and this is exactly why I married a penny pincher, because I suck at this lol! I got caught up in all the steps on this sub but I always find my skin looks and feels better every time I go back to my minimal routine. I think that‚Äôs a really good point! I kept with my routine for the LONGEST time until I had my first kiddo. Then I tried switching it up and kept going back to my old routine (not that it was much of a routine, Olay dry facial cloth and body lubriderm on my face‚Äîoh to be young again haha). But after my second my face was like ‚Äúno, just no,‚Äù and a friend said to try just moisturizing every night and using an eye cream. Take weekly photos‚Äîwell she was right! I saw a significant difference and ever since I‚Äôve become a skincare junkie chasing that same high haha I love it and the cerave foaming cleanser but dove is A LOT cheaper and the 8 pack lasts me half a year hahah Seems like it‚Äôs more common than I thought then haha! Yes, weirdly enough I find this to be the case as well. Completely forgot to mention it, thanks for bringing it up! I'm sorry you keep getting DVs. I recently read somewhere, and I'm kicking myself for not saving it, that there's new data that retinoids may not cause photosensitivity after all. They do irritate the skin and make it more sensitive, which would exacerbate a sunburn but it might not actually be the direct cause of the burn itself. No, the pros don't outweigh the cons. There are lots of cheap SPF and there are moisturizers with SPF that are also very affordable, and considering that you're using tret you should really protect yourself from sun. [deleted] Until a year ago I was only putting spf on when I was going outdoors, and I rarely do go outdoors because I have a sun allergy which just pops up on my arms and chest and I also have a rare neuro vascular condition called erythromelalgia where I am on fire throughout the day where my flares get up to 106 degrees. I started tret about 10 months ago and went somewhere in the car for 15 minutes and didn't put sunscreen on my face and now I have melasma on my right cheekbone, so frustrating! I didn't wear sunscreen until my mid 30's when all the sun damage popped up. I used to have cute freckles across my nose and cheeks. But now I just have hyperpigmentation and melasma, it sucks!

But I started wearing it daily because blue light is damaging to skin as well as long as environmental stressors. When I put it on now I feel positive about it like I am putting an invisible shield on my face.
There are a lot of great sunscreens out their especially Asian beauty sunscreens, because the approved sunscreens in the US is ancient and ridiculous. Biore, purito, Etude house, and p:rem are popular ones. 
You might like something like [Coola full spectrum refreshing water mist sunscreen ](https://coola.com/products/full-spectrum-360-refreshing-water-mist-organic-face-sunscreen-spf-18?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhIP6BRCMARIsALu9LfmoqTorAQ6bJUtkpT731lnEyqMxC07XT4a6LzGobm5GZupeBdXVU5YaAreeEALw_wcB) it has a low spf so it would be best as an add on for reapplying throughout the day, but it might be something you would be more comfortable with as a main one to get started. So I definitely don't wear sunscreen when I am only inside either- I also find that to be a waste of money. Also, when I am just getting some incidental sun exposure, like driving 20 minutes to school or the grocery store, I don't re-apply because that's a bit much for me as well. However, I (and most people) do use SPF because I am using a retinoid and I know that this makes my skin more sensitive to the sun and I don't want to risk damaging my skin. I also know that to achieve my long-term goals, SPF is necessary. 

I get the budget thing- believe me. I am also a student. There are affordable sunscreens out there, and if you're in the US, there are affordable and easy ways to get Asian sunscreens as well. 

That being said, you do know your own skin better than us and what you decide to do is between you and your dermatologist. I appreciate your concern! I just personally find that the pros don‚Äôt outweigh the cons for me, this includes other things that I didn‚Äôt mention because the comment was getting too long. When my budget is not as restrained I‚Äôm looking to try the Supergoop Unseen sunscreen as I heard great things about it, it‚Äôs just too pricey for me right now!


Edit: To clarify: I just don‚Äôt wear sunscreen every single day, that‚Äôs all. Due to the nature of my job/school/studying etc I spend almost all my time indoors! I‚Äôm not going to reapply sunscreen (because if it‚Äôs only part of AM routine it‚Äôll be ineffective by noon) every couple of hours when I‚Äôm on my laptop/in a lecture hall mostly. I‚Äôm not anti-sun protection. Additionally, I live in the city. The amount of sun that I‚Äôm exposed to is really very little due to the buildings as well (this is on top of wearing a hat, using an umbrella and choosing low UV times of day). Not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted... actually I do know why. Remember that I know my skin and my situation best please, strangers of the internet. Thanks for the concern! You‚Äôre right. My main skin concern is breakouts. Luckily, I have both my ethnicity and family generics on my side when it comes to aging and fine lines. That being said, when my budget allows, finding a suitable daily use sunscreen will be a priority! Thanks for all the recs! I don't live in the US so no Ultas that I can go to but I will take a look at the others! Thanks for the thoughtful product recs! Thanks for the rec, unfortunately I don‚Äôt live in the US, no Target in my country :( Note: I'm from Canada, not sure where you are located and if the process is different. 
I went to my family doc first and he gave me a referral to see a derm (bc I can't just go see a derm by myself). This was mostly because I have some other health complications that interfere with the "wear spf when using tret" rule. I've heard (someone else on this thread has shared) that family docs can prescribe tret as well. 

As for if your skin has be "bad" enough, I don't really know, but I doubt it. If you have concerns I'm sure seeing doc/derm and asking wouldn't hurt (depending on accessiblilty/affordability at least). Not super helpful, sorry but I wish you the best! Yes! I use a similar thing, I forgot to mention that the tray I'm talking about isn't built into my shower caddy or whatever. It's a separate thing that has: a layer with slots where the sits to let residue seep off, a catching layer to hold the residue, and a lid. I love this sub but I really hate how militant people can be about sunscreen. If you‚Äôre indoors most of the time *and* your skin doesn‚Äôt react well to most sunscreens, what‚Äôs the point in worrying too much about it? Not everyone can afford to try a bunch of different ones, and hey! A little sun every now and then is not going to turn you into a leather bag! You could get a moisturizer + sunscreen in one which would be cheaper Missha sun milk is much more affordable and doesnt feel like anything on the skin. I hate the feel of sunscreen on my face, please look into more options for right now. Spf is extremely important.

Edit: uva (aging) rays come through your windows. And bounce off walls and buildings and sidewalks. I feel the same way. I spend the vast majority of my day inside. On days I know I'll be outside, I use Purito Comfy Water. You can find it on Amazon and it's only ~$15. Super affordable for tight budgets! Sunscreen is effective all day. It's only after 2 hours of sun exposure that you should reapply. [deleted] If you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, and not sure where you are located, there was another post on comparing Supergoop Unseen and a Kroger (grocery store) version of it. Waaay cheaper and the OP said it was just as good.

Edit to add the post [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/id0x4j/review_supergoop_unseen_sunscreen_vs_cheap_dupe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) yeah, I definitely don't have the chemical knowledge to really understand it, but afaik they are similar. Glad to see Dove on here though! When I was having terrible skin rashes due to auto-immune stuff that beauty bar saved my LIFE üëç I'm glad your mum looks beautiful and I hope you inherit that as well. My own mum never had a pimple that I can remember and had few wrinkles. But, even though I'm now older myself, "everything" still breaks me out. Taz was the only thing gave me clear skin, for once in my life, but my insurance stopped covering it and the price became ~$350 a tube. I switched to retin-a for a while, but it was still too expensive.
  
Sorry, my skin is acting up at the moment and I'm grumpy I remembered how much better it was on rx. You do have a point, yeah. I‚Äôm a bit torn because normal plastic bottles can at least be recycled and this paper can‚Äôt but I do think that overall packaging such as that of the bar is more sustainable than any bottle out there, especially as they‚Äôre about to change it to a plastic-free coating. Oh maybe it‚Äôs different in Europe/Sweden specifically. We don‚Äôt have the 30 spf one and it‚Äôs absolutely not greasy. Maybe if you travel sometime you can try it out ? lol 

If not the cerave one I really love the purito comfy water sunblock. Definitely comfy to wear. I have a short review of it on a recent post if you‚Äôre interested! What size is it? I‚Äôm going for a hunt for this tub! Lol Haha dang it.  I‚Äôll have to see if amazon has it in stock next time mine runs out. Woah what? For some reason the picture makes it look way bigger than 539g lol!!
It‚Äôs $26.99 at shoppers but they often go on sale for $19.99 I believe! Uh I will look into that. Where I am there are limited assortment, 1 or 2. But I will look. The skin sensitivity is pretty common I understand. Many thanks,it‚Äôs always nice to have a product endorsement. I have thanks! I wish mine could be this simple. Love three steps in skincare. Ah, the beauties of the Canadian healthcare system! Reminds me of a nutritionist I follow on YouTube who is Canadian and always recommends talking to "your nutritionist" for things that will vary for individuals. Lmao I'm like, I pay for my insurance every month out of my paycheck and fairly high copays too, and still have virtually no access to a nutritionist, dermatologist, or even a therepist. (The insurance company I have in my state is widely known for being awful and not helping people, but it's the main one most people have for some reason)

Anyway, thanks for answering! I'll have to keep looking if I want to find something cheaper I didn‚Äôt mean that I should be seeing a lot of difference but I read of so many quick, good and bad, reactions to tretinoin that I‚Äôm almost surprised that I got neither haha. But thanks! My skin isn‚Äôt very damaged at all only mild acne texture so it will probably take some time for me to see results, but I‚Äôm already glad I‚Äôm not getting any sensitivity issues with it, even though I think I have pretty reactive skin. No It's cool it's a solid routine. Valeant used to be a massive fraud pharmaceutical company. But like economic fraud not their actual products. They were adquired so they're supposed to not be evil anymore. I just thought I would never see them again as a brand. But the tret will be perfectly good they just suck for different reasons. Ah, you are correct. Thank you! Ah yeah I understand that. I just was recommending the documentary because it‚Äôs really good. Awesome, you are looking great Sara! Is that serious? I haven‚Äôt heard of facial exercising as a thing, but now I‚Äôm going to look into it! oh my goodness, I‚Äôm so happy that it was helpful for you!!!! It‚Äôs so nice to find holy grail products It's a bit iffy on that one.  They are going in the right direction. i learned this in cosmetology school, when your skin is feeling ‚Äútight‚Äù after you wash it, its caused by 1) the ingredients in the soap being too dry for your skin, and 2) you havent actually washed it all off your face. i cant vouch for the beauty bars bc ive never used them, but there are a few products out there that dry my skin to hell and dove soap is one of them

edit: face and body, whatever part of the skin youre using the soap on essentially. even though it feels like its cleaning its actually clogging your pores up, hence the ‚Äútight‚Äù feeling They‚Äôre cruelty free now! Dove is owned by Unilever and they recently went cruelty free on all their products:) a year or two ago I think I mean, my great grandmother only used oil of olay her entire life and swore by it... I obviously have some of her genetics and can't use it at all. People are different. Formulas change. Things aren't the same for everyone, or even the same regimen for a person foreverrrrrrr. Find something that works for you now, and be ready to change your routine every few years. *sirens begin wailing in the distance* I bought it once, loved the fragrance and it was moisturizing. I bought another one and it didn't moisturize and didnt smell as nice. So weird.. Amazing to hear! Thank you. Nothing beats the feeling of knowing that you can stock up with a 10-pack of Ivory for like $10 and be set for the next 2-3 years. lol Ivory Original. It's the one that comes in the blue packaging. Unfortunately, I'm not from India. Both Dove and Ivory are readily available at big supermarkets here in my country. They're both products imported from the US, so maybe try your luck at stores that import goods from the US? That makes sense. To my knowledge the issue with regular soap is that the pH is so high, so if a syndet bar is pH 5 - 6 it should be fine. This. I feel like this whole comment section is just people trying to explain how a bar of soap is not actually soap, lol. That's a good point, in this particular product there is still a little traditional soap (although it's mainly syndets). However, if it's not an alkaline pH that shouldn't be an issue afaik. Really ? I don't see them listed in the ingredients Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. It's those dark marks you get on your face after a spot or whatever heals up. I'd assume that PIH refers to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Thank you! I was never particularly hairy for my ethnicity or anything, but I did have dark peach fuzz and after years of threading and waxing, decided to get laser which was a terrible decision. It ended up actually triggering more hair growth in areas I had almost nothing and also led to most peach fuzz becoming terminal hairs! Electrolysis is a longer process and more of a time commitment but much safer and actually does the job instead of being potentially detrimental like laser. I just have to make sure I take care of my skin and protect it between the twice weekly treatments üòÖ There's plenty of alcohol free witch hazel from basically every drugstore brand - Thayer's, Dickenson's, etc. Witch Hazel toners can be alcohol-free (several are and she told me to use one like that only). Also even dermatologists like Dr. Dray on YouTube have said that witch hazel is soothing and good for keeping wounds & certain skin conditions clean, albeit can be drying for sure. Like lots of ingredients it has it‚Äôs pros and cons depending on the situation. I love Hyram‚Äôs videos since they‚Äôre easy to understand for younger viewers but I‚Äôm not on board with his blanket statements about witch hazel. I don‚Äôt think your average person needs to be using it daily but there are certain skin conditions where it‚Äôs the best option. For me personally, I do use it after treatment (she wipes the area with witch hazel pads to keep it sanitized since a needle is being inserted and you want to keep out bacteria) but then when I get home I moisturize that night with a safe Vitamin E cream. (Some electrologists like her don‚Äôt want you to apply any creams for 48 hours while others say to moisturize, so I do what I noticed worked best for me.) Depends on the person‚Äôs skin. If it had fragrance I would be vary but otherwise different ingredients tend to work for different people. Are you talking about cleansers? Yeah, I mispoke... A lot of companies are putting out lower ph cleansers now and using surfactants that are less harsh. But there are a lot that are basic. There are so many different components to a cleanser and a lower ph doesn't necessarily mean its gentler, same with a high ph doesn't mean its bad. But when you have a gentle cleanser with a ph closer to our own, it is easier on our skin. I felt the same! Turns out that the dove bar is technically a cream cleanser which is kinda like the oil cleanser step. Since then I switched to the kose speedy and my skin has been even clearer and now spf doesn‚Äôt make me break out. The dove kept me clear but my skin is even more consistent since switching to the kose. I don‚Äôt do a second cleanser - I tried for awhile but it was too drying. For a few days my skin looked incredible but then it went the other way. Well, I don‚Äôt care about the votes ‚Äî this is just reddit after all, but some people are being unnecessarily rude which is very off putting. I think I heard something similar recently from one of the many science-skincare sources that I like to read/watch. dr dray just made a video that briefly covered that topic if you're interested: [six myths about retinol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcdLEQyrQhw). They specified the pros don‚Äôt outweigh the cons for THEM. Doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be true for you. They explained their reasoning, you don‚Äôt have to agree (and fwiw I don‚Äôt agree either), but it comes off as pretty self-righteous to argue somebody‚Äôs personal preference. She said personally. For her person specifically, the pros don‚Äôt outweigh the cons. You can‚Äôt decide that for her lmao. Don‚Äôt act like your opinion is above hers why are people on this sub so dogmatic??? ok so you went to one bad doctor and suddenly you know more about OP‚Äôs health than them and their doctor?? seems like they‚Äôre aware of the risk the sun poses and have reasons behind what their routine is. it‚Äôs really none of your business what anyone puts on their face. not to mention, most people are inside all day and feel the need to use a ton of sunscreen. don‚Äôt get me wrong, i use spf daily (unless i‚Äôm like sick in bed) but i‚Äôm not going to go out of my way lecturing people about spf!! we all know skin cancer exists, but people have other health concerns too Thanks for the concern. I got Tret prescribed from a derm to whom I explained all my reasons. Some of which include health related things that I don‚Äôt feel the need to share with the internet. If you don‚Äôt know everything about my situation, which you don‚Äôt, you can make generalized statements even if it‚Äôs generally correct. My derm okayed it, so I believe it does.

I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so concerned about a stranger on Reddit that you need them to elaborate on what those reasons are for them, PERSONALLY. Thanks for the recs! Asian sunscreens are just too pricey (and even if the unit itself isn't shipping/duties/customs will since I don't live in the US I can't use those popular sites to order. 

I'm sorry to hear about your sun allergy and erythromelagia, that sounds awful. I hope you're able to keep it under control! So rare to come across a fellow PMLE sufferer! The struggle is most definitely real! I appreciate your concern, thanks! I agree with everything in your post! Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt live in the US so my options are limited, esp when factoring in duties/customs etc. Supergoop also sells its play chemical sunscreen in a huge quantity which brings down the price by a lot of you might be interested I personally use the Play Everyday sunscreen from Supergoop because it's significantly more affordable and has higher UVA coverage and find the texture to work well as long as I apply it on dry skin and give it a couple minutes to sink in. Absolutely no white cast (and I have pretty dark skin)! But you definitely know your skin best, just thought it may be worth considering :) Here is a photo that might change your mind. This really illustrates the damage the sun can cause over the years. This man was a trucker who drove long distances, so one side of his face was always exposed to the sun, through the window of his car. The other side of his face was not exposed to as much sun. There's a very stark difference. Wear sunscreen everyone!

[https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/28/photo-truck-driver-shows-28-years-sun-damage-looks-like-7266641/](https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/28/photo-truck-driver-shows-28-years-sun-damage-looks-like-7266641/) Have you tried Australian gold tinted sunscreen? It applies like a makeup primer and if your skin tone is fair/light it should disappear right into your skin. I see you‚Äôre only 18 but aging sneaks up on you and sunscreen is really important if you‚Äôre using a retinoid. I started getting lines at 24 and I really wish I had been more careful when I was younger.

Edit: I forgot Australian gold also came out with darker shades too! Thank you! This is refreshing to see! This sub is a lot more chill about sunscreen than any derm I've gone to. It's one of those basic health preventative things like brushing your teeth, except you're trying to avoid skin cancer rather than cavities. If you're out in the sun and if you're using products that increase the risk from the sun, you need sunscreen. Thanks for the rec! I‚Äôve tried one or two, and found them to be too greasy. Thanks for the rec! Thanks for the rec! >A hat will not protect you

Oh lawd guess I better throw my UPF 50 wide-brimmed hat away! Just a heads up, people can decide what they put on their skin and it makes zero difference to you. You sound condescending and arrogant and frankly it's a little ridiculous for a fucking skincare subreddit. I appreciate the concern. I do in fact use sunscreen, just not every day while reapplying every couple hours. I assure you my reasoning is valid considering other things I haven‚Äôt mentioned. Remember I‚Äôm using tret, which I got prescribed from a derm. I obviously explained all my ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù reasoning to my derm, which she okayed. Thanks for the insightful rec! Unfortunately I don't live in the US so no Kroger :( So happy to hear those rashes are behind you now. I hope your immune system stays healthy! I understand, it can be very frustrating. I do hope you're able to keep it under control! I‚Äôve heard that recycling isn‚Äôt very efficient/effective as in many things that thrown in the recycling never actually get recycled. This might vary based on where you‚Äôre from though. I think all we can do is our best. Tra-travel??? You mean the T-word I haven‚Äôt seen used since 2019?? Hahah, Sweden seems like such a lovely place to live! It‚Äôs 539g or 19oz! I hope you find it! *I have thanks! I wish*

*Mine could be this simple. Love*

That‚Äôs even better then! I was the same: no peeling/redness/flaking despite having heard from others that this would be the case. Lucky you! I see. It‚Äôs what was prescribed to me so I didn‚Äôt get to ‚Äúshop around‚Äù much because it‚Äôs the brand that my insurance covers. No worries, I actually don't have a Netflix account but I'm sure it was very insightful. I do try to "vote with my dollar" when possible but I don't have very many "dollars". Maybe one day... haha. And here I am thinking the tightness = clean. Thank you for the heads up! Unfortunately, that is not 100% true. Most companies that continue to sell in China are not completely off the hook, as China has their own regulations which require testing on animals. This is a good article about it! [Dove Now Claims To Be Cruelty-Free (But Here‚Äôs Why They‚Äôre Not)](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/news/dove-cruelty-free-update/) Weird. I'd have been tempted to get in touch with CeraVe. They may want to test to see if it's counterfeit. It‚Äôs interesting how heated people get over other people‚Äôs skin care routines. Yep, that's what I believe as well‚Äì it's down to pH.

Also I love your name. Blue tansy is lovely, and great for the skin! [This](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-79bvd/images/stencil/2048x2048/products/13601/27463/Dove_Beauty_Bar_Sensitive_Skin_4_oz_2_Bar_2__87719.1539116260.jpg) is the ingredients listing I'm looking at. Sodium Tallowate is animal fat soap. Sodium Hydroxide (lye) + Tallow = Sodium tallowate, and the same goes for sodium palmitate (lye/palm), sodium cocoate (lye/coconut oil), etc.

Edit: typo That sounds like a whole process wow. I'm sorry to hear that your laser treatment made things worse, that must have been such a let down and a disheartening waste of money. Here's to your new baby-smooth skin after you finish electrolysis, cheers! Electrolysis was the best investment I ever made for my skin. No more of the tweezing, constant face-touching, ingrown hairs and subsequent skin picking. It took time and money, but now my skin is healthier than it's ever been in my entire life. Yep but i feel like it may work for now but see the problem along the line. Once the damage is there you cant really do anything bout it no more Goddamn people are so insanely smug about sunscreen it‚Äôs ridiculous. Like they act like they‚Äôre soooo concerned for the damage you‚Äôre doing to yourself, but if that was really the point, how is being rude going to make you any likelier you take their advice? It‚Äôs NOT concern, they are just being self-righteous.

Next people are going to start berating me because I don‚Äôt exercise and common advice is to exercise at least twice a week. Is it because they are concerned about me and don‚Äôt want me to have bad health? Nope. They just like to hear the sound of their own opinions. 

FWIW OP, I‚Äôm sure you should probably be wearing sunscreen, but I trust you have your reasons why not and it sounds like you actually talked to your doctor about it- which is better than most people- so you do you. I checked out that video, great source of info! For anyone interested: retinoids do not increase your risk of sunburn and they do not make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Dr Dray talks about it as her 4th myth from 5:38 to 7:27! May I introduce you to /r/SCAcirclejerk? If she's posting it here publicly then it kinda is "my business", or at least I can comment, because that's what it's about.

She acts like getting sun directly on her face is the only way to get it... As if she didn't have any other body parts. 

And as I said in my another comment - if you're sitting in a room where plants can grow, then there's sun in the room. You don't have to be out on the beach to get UV. One of gynecologists I went to didn't agree to prescribe me my contraception pills, because "I can poison myself all I want, but she's a woman of God and she won't do it to me"... ;) My point being - doctors don't always fully care about you, or they simply have their reasons to skip important facts.

I don't care about your medical reasons to get tret, but they don't make you immune to sun. Tretinol clashes with sun. You can hurt your skin if you don't use SPF... And just because it's not blinding sunny it doesn't mean that there's no UV (and other rays that I didn't actually memorized) when you go outside.

And you don't need to be outside to receive these rays. If plants are growing in the room, then there's sun rays in there. So unless your school is in the basement, you get exposed to sunlight. What kind of health condition would make you incapable of wearing sunscreen outside of just skin sensitivity? Do you not want to wear it just for comfort reasons? There are so many different options out there in terms of formulation, there‚Äôs got to be one that is passable for you! I wear only mineral sunscreen and after the first week or two of wearing it you get used to it. I never found a chemical sunscreen that didn‚Äôt sting. Mineral sunscreen is just thicker and a little more tedious to apply evenly. But if I‚Äôm wearing makeup on top of it I don‚Äôt notice it‚Äôs there at all. [deleted] That sucks! I have this horrible habit of spacing about the fact that we aren't all in the same country. Hopefully you will be able to find something that works and is accessible and affordable.
Thank you, I appreciate it! Take care:-) Thanks for the rec! What the picture doesn't show is, that the truck driver had a condition that caused his skin to age at an abnormal speed.
Surely UV rays did their part of doing so but his condition has also to be taken in mind. I appreciate your concern. I‚Äôve actually seen this before, because I‚Äôve thought this through. I assure you that considering everything (including aspects that I didn‚Äôt mention, I‚Äôm doing what works for me currently! I appreciate your concern, thank you for the rec! OP said her derm okayed her routine and lack of sunscreen, so I just personally don‚Äôt think everyone getting on her back about it/telling her any routine is pointless if she‚Äôs not wearing sunscreen when she‚Äôs indoors most of the time is warranted. If you‚Äôre looking to try another one, I like the Trader Joe‚Äôs Enrich sunscreen.  It‚Äôs not greasy and it doesn‚Äôt have that sunscreen smell. It only has an SPF of 15, so I tend to use it as a daily moisturizer not if I‚Äôm going to the beach or anything like that. Did you not notice her flair?? She clearly knows what she‚Äôs taking about and she shouldn‚Äôt be second guessed. /s aw, thanks dude! i hope your skin stays happy as well! :D Well I meant more like sometime in the future hahaha 

Yeah it‚Äôs like living in a bubble. Sure, terrible things happen in every country but the frase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so lucky/glad to live in sweden‚Äù is very common here. Kind people, free healthcare and education, no crazy politics(mostly) and pretty much no dangerous plants or animals etc. 
Lol this sounds like a commercial but tbh, hearing everything that‚Äôs going on everywhere, I‚Äôm damn glad I live in Sweden Thank you! Yes it is and thank you! Yeah don't worry any tret will do. You don't have to shop around get what works for you. I wasn't trying to make a point on it being bad or good I just thought it was funny I saw valeant. Unilever is certainly not a cruelty free company and Dove is sold in mainland China meaning it can be subject to post-market testing. Here‚Äôs another interesting article, also contains suggestions for cruelty free dupes of the beauty bar. [Is Dove Cruelty Free? ](https://crueltyfreeguide.com/dove-cruelty-free-vegan/) Thanks! It's been a name I've been using for about 10 years now. I actually didn't know it was an essential oil or used on the skin when I first started using it. Huh that's tricky! I was looking at this and it says that it's not a soap bar before describing it as a beauty soap bar at the end. https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/41560/dove-beauty-bar-regular-2-x-100g-pack I was looking for saponified ingredients so I missed it! Thank you so much üíï It was tragic and I had no idea why it happened until a couple years after I started researching and realized lots of women (especially Indian and Arab) have experienced the same after laser. I‚Äôm much happier that electrolysis treatments have opened up again safely after lockdown üôèüèº This gives me so much motivation to continue! It‚Äôs expensive (and will be even more so once I move to a big city soon) but I‚Äôm committed to the next 2 years & then being free from that hassle & insecurity for life üëäüèº Thanks for the polite concern and open-mindedness, I appreciate it! lol thank u man I wish that sub was actually funny Like I‚Äôve rehashed many times, I have health reasons that require me to get some sunlight. Not a burn, not a tan, but some. Thanks for your deep concern about the anti-aging of my skin. Not incapable of wearing sunscreen, but I have issues with vit D absorption from my diet so I need to get some from the sun. I live somewhere with long winters and play high-impact sports so I‚Äôm at risk for osteoporosis/stress fractures etc. Thanks for being polite and understanding, unlike the rest of this sub which I didn‚Äôt realize could be so militant about sunscreen usage. I‚Äôm not being snippy. Like you said, this is a public space so I‚Äôm allowed to explain myself, no? I‚Äôm glad everyone here is deeply concerned about the anti-aging of my skin and is super pro-sunscreen 24/7 but I‚Äôm sharing an opposing experience/viewpoint like one does in a public space. Damn, insufferable people like you who berate others for being "snippy" while being rude af and implying she's one of "the crazies" is what led to r/SCAcirclejerk/ It's a very American thing! Centre of the universe and all. The fact that people drag out that picture anytime there‚Äôs a sunscreen circlejerk is maddening. People act like they don‚Äôt see everyday people all the time who don‚Äôt wear sunscreen and don‚Äôt look like that. Its fear mongering IMO. We know NOTHING else about that truck driver‚Äôs skin and medical health history. Exactly. I thought the first rule of this sub was "Be kind" not "Hound on people for not wearing sunscreen every day". Strange how the SCA's here seem to think they know everything about my situation and my medical history from one reddit post... I do appreciate the recommendations though! Thanks for the rec! Unfortunately, I don't live in the US and there are no TJ's in my country :( lol. *a lot* of people are responding like that though and most are being upvoted. I get the concern over sunscreen importance but I don't understand why people are getting up in arms to argue when OP has already made their points clear. That kind of feedback makes this a very unwelcoming, hostile subreddit sometimes :( It does sound so lovely! I‚Äôm from Canada which is honestly a great country but you really are making Sweden out to be the country of my dreams hahha. Cheers! i mean anybody could test anything on animals right? No worries! According to the FDA (I think), you can only call your product 'soap' if the only cleansing agent in it is the saponified oils. Since Dove has syndets & soap, they can't legally call it soap. I think this is where they enter the use of 'beauty bar'. You still have 2 arms and 2 legs to get all that sun. And all the other body parts that you can expose when not necessarily in public.

I mean, you do you, for all I care you can wash your face with sand paper, but using tret and exposing your face to sun sound rather dangerous long term. I see! Do keep trying to find some UV protection for your skin, especially with your age! I didn‚Äôt start wearing sunscreen for anti-aging until I was 24 (and I was a teenager during the tanning bed/ jersey shore bronze craze era) and could kick myself for waiting so long. Even a lower SPF for daily wear and a higher SPF for when you‚Äôre doing outdoor activities. You‚Äôll still get enough vitamin D from passive absorption, especially if other parts of your body are exposed (like arms or legs). Winter in your part of the world may be a different story, but it‚Äôs a good goal to keep in mind. If you weren‚Äôt using tret I think people would be more relaxed about your choice here. Hello friend, so sorry to hear that you have issues with vitamin d absorption. Exposing your arms/forearms and your legs is enough for this. As much as possible, it would better if you expose these areas around 8-10 am or after 4pm since the sun is on its peak between 10am to 4pm. Also, since you are using tretinoin, I do not think exposing your face is a good idea so I suggest that you wear a UPF clothing to shield your face when outdoors. Take care ‚ù§ Hey you might enjoy us at /r/SCAcirclejerk [deleted] Oh also, if white cast is a concern for you, La Roche Posay‚Äôs tinted mineral sunscreen has a nice thin formulation, some color so there‚Äôs no white cast, and the mineral formulation means it feels like nothing on my skin and doesn‚Äôt sting my eyes. It‚Äôs unfortunately pretty expensive compared to drugstore brands (may be different where you live!) but it‚Äôs my all-time HG daily sunscreen wear. One bottle of it lasts me a good long while. :) Are you  taking a vit D supplment? If you‚Äôre adamant about not wear sunscreen regularly fine but I‚Äôm confused how come your doctor just told you to skip the sunscreen when he perscribed you medication which can make skin incredibly sensitive to the sun knowing that you have a vit D deficiency that severe. Genuine question - what are your goals in using the tret? I can‚Äôt picture a single situation where you would see positive results while not ramping up sun protection exactly welcome to sca, mods don't care, they let people run wild over everyone's post. I'm surprised yours is even getting riff, I thought this would be the golden child post since yours is so cheap(anything not drugstore gets a lot of instant hate like sunscreen I guess). Ive always thought of Canada kinda similar to Sweden? Not that I actually know anything about it but I imagine it like with way more nature than cities and with not so many people and everyone is kind and there‚Äôs snow and moose and calm and peace So? Doesn't mean they should. Huh. I get what they are trying to do but that actually makes it more confusing! I suppose that they are in an odd spot because they still can't call it soap free... so it's not soap nor soap free lol. i believe op knows their situation best so let them be :) Yeah I mean honestly, if you're not using tret and getting sun that's one thing. But if you're using tret you're literally risking skin cancer at a much higher level by not using sunscreen. It's not just an aging thing. It's irresponsible but whatevs it's your skin you're ruining. You can order many Asian sunscreens on Amazon for under $15. Price isn't an excuse. Thanks for the open-mindedness and politeness. It's mostly to build up my vitamin D stores. I do appreciate the concern. Thanks for the kind words! I need to build up my vit D stores in the summer months to last me throughout the winter. The plan that my derm + family doc put together is for me to take hour-long walks in the early morning (in summertime when it‚Äôs warm enough) I wear a hat and often times capris and a thin long sleeve of its not too hot (another perk of early morning). They estimated that the residual exposure (+ other minimal exposure throughout the day) would be enough while minimizing other harmful effects. So similar to what you‚Äôve outlined! I appreciate the polite concern, thanks! the study that makes everyone believe that it‚Äôs So So important to wear spf with retinol is kinda deceptive. i‚Äôm not arguing that ppl shouldn‚Äôt make an effort to wear sunscreen when appropriate but people on this sub are truly crazy about sunscreen sometimes Thanks for the rec! I've tried vit d supplement but I have absorption issues. It helps (I still take it) but not enough. To clarify, I don't "skip" sunscreen. I just don't wear sunscreen every single day because of my lifestyle/schedule/location/climate my exposure to sun is very limited. And that limited amount I need. I've voiced the concerns that everyone in this thread have (so kindly) rehashed and the solution that we came up with was to control my expousure as much as possible while still getting enough. It's a fine balance and there's more to it but I don't feel the need/don't want to explain all the nitty gritty. Breakout prevention. Believe me when I say I have my reasoning, which I have discussed with my primary care doc + derm, to get some sun exposure. Well yes and no. We (like the US) also have a very vocal extreme-right group. Our elected country leader flip flops between right wing and center. Our left wing political party is not as popular as I wish it was. Anyway we are getting so off topic haha. Take care! i mean that anybody could test anything on animals, so even cruelty free brands may be considered not cruelty free by some people, just because you cant guarantee that someone out there didnt test it on animals I have no idea why people are downvoting you. May be the cancer part, but after all your point is good...

And even if $15 is not affordable to some, there are cheaper options out there as well. If she doesn't want to go for 50spf the. At least 15 would be better than nothing... In Germany in a popular store you can buy a moisturizer with SPF 15 and I think it's less than 5‚Ç¨... I buy it for my boyfriend and it works really good for him. There are many cheap, and still good options, sometimes they leave white film, so are less convenient, but I think it's worth saving your skin. Why bother with skincare at all if you're going to go against the suggestions of how to use the product? Hey as long as if works more power to you, just seems counterintuitive is all. 

For what it‚Äôs worth since you mentioned you‚Äôre an a student budget and I am too - my HG spf is literally store brand from a local drugstore, of all things. Check out the sensitive lines if they have those. Aw. Well just move here then ! lol yeah this went out of hand. Nice talking to you anyway! :) That does not even make sense. There is a grey area of course because many ingredients have been tested on animals at some point or, the company may claim the final product is cruelty-free but the individual ingredients may have been.

PM

* Farmacy Green Clean: I use this to double cleanse if I'm wearing makeup and smells great!
* CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser: HG, been using this for 5 years and it never lets me down. Doesn't strip skin or break me out
* Saturday Skin 10% glycolic acid toner: new buy and have used it 3x this week, and already love it! makes my skin so soft and glowy the next day that I'm SHOOKETH
* Caudalie Vine\[Activ\] Overnight Detox Oil: Light pleasant herbal scent and helps me with breakouts. I switched from harsh acne products to this and the occasional hydrocolloid patch and my skin is 10000x better
* Moisturizer (not pictured): FAB Ultra Repair (my HG!) or YTTP Adaptogen Cream
* DE Marula Oil: I attribute the demise of my dry patches to this
* Farmacy Dew it All Eye cream: It's ok. It's hydrating but doesn't do sh\*t about my dark a\*\* dark circles. Using it up but wouldn't repurchase
* Glossier Balm dotcom in rose: Love the rosey scent, but too similar to vaseline pink for me to repurchase

AM

* CeraVe hydrating cleanser
* YTTP Adaptogen Hydrating Mist: mini size to try out, honestly it just makes me feel fancy
* Moisturizer: FAB or YTTP
* Sunscreen: Centella Green Level Safe sun or Elta MD UV clear 46: Elta MD is my HG and has niacinamide in it for breakouts, but I use centella if I'm using Vit C products
* Primer: either Laneige Glowy makeup serum or Milk Hydro Grip: Laneige one is new but holy heck it is nice af! Nice subtle glow and poreless finish! Milk is great for long lasting makeup all day!
* Dior Lip Glow in 001 Pink: Starts out glossy and becomes balmy throughout the day. Nice and moisturizing and delectable scent. I'm not a fan of pigmented lips so this one is an A+ in my book!

Masks (1-2 times per week)

* Origins Original Skin retexturizing mask with rose clay: a gentle clay mask! Dream!
* Origins Drink Up Overnight Intensive: This is a really old bottle my sister gave me (possibly before they reformulated it?) and wow, leaves me with super bright and hydrated skin! I can even wear it during the day and it's not sticky or uncomfortable.
* Laneige Cica Sleeping Mask (not pictured but also green!): a new buy, but DAMN redness be GONE

Also I didn't realize how many products I used until writing this, so I'm already doing a fair job judging myself. Some days I just use FAB moisturizer and that's it. Do w/e makes you happy and take care of yourself :) This is so aesthetically pleasing! I have combo oily skin as well and am looking for a new sunscreen how does the Purito Cantella one work for you? I‚Äôve never heard of the Saturday skin but the packaging is everything. Is it fragrance free? I‚Äôve been debating to get the Dior lip oil. I am glad you are liking it. I might have to get some! Thanks! What a beautiful set up / package palette!  Would you rebuy the Laneige Glowy makeup serum? Beautiful! 

I'm curious about the overnight cica mask you mentioned-- what kind of redness were you experiencing that it helped with? I use the Cerave cleanser and sunscreen for the Purito sun and Elta MD one as well! good to see someone using the same products as mine :) What toner do you use apart from the acid toner? it seems not for daily use because of the acid content. any suggestion?? I don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs said it yet, as I‚Äôve not read all the comments - but I‚Äôve used the Drunk Elephant Marula oil and The Ordinary Marula oil (about a fraction of the price and bigger bottle) and it‚Äôs made no difference to my skin which one I used (both great). But my purse is about ¬£40 better off :) I love Origins masks too! I think that the Overnight is really underrated. Whenever I feel lazy and don't want to do multi-steps, I simply wash my face and put it on. It was extremely helpful when I was under Accutane. I can‚Äôt get over how cute your products are! Sometimes I admit I just buy something for the packaging, I can‚Äôt resist üò´ I'm surprised there's not a Pixi product in here somewhere. Would fit the aesthetic perfectly Love this picture. Is the hydrating facial cleanser foaming? I‚Äôve been looking for a cleanser that foames up but doesn‚Äôt dry the skin I‚Äôm trying out this routine. You should try the Origins makeup remover jelly, it‚Äôs one of my fav first cleansers! 

Do you like the laniege glowy serum? Looks pretty!! 

I used to love a Dior lip gloss, I can‚Äôt remember the exact name, lip smoothing polish? They discontinued it along with my fav rose lip balm ): So sad lol i have the same origins masks :) and the cerave cleanser, though i prefer Kiehl's cucumber cleanser, it takes my makeup off effortlessly and a little bit goes a long way. Such a pretty shelfie!!
What do you think about the YTTP adaptogen cream? I just bought the dewy makeup serum and I cannot wait to try it!! Thanks for the review! The cica sleeping mask has also quickly become an HG for me, I am using epiduo forte (adapalene and BP) which has made my skin much more sensitive than it used to be. The sleeping mask calms redness and soothes my skin so well! Oftentimes I end up buying products that all have similar colors.. I‚Äôve always wondered if other people do that too! Have you tried YTTP‚Äôs overnight mask? If you like their other products, you should test it out! It really leaves your skin so dewy and bright. This picture is so aestheticly pleasing to me Does the Cerave cleanser leave a film on your skin? Sounds like we have a similar skin type. Can‚Äôt wait to try out some of these products. The Caudalie sounds great! Is it really an oil, or more a thick essence? I use the purifying balm from Darphin right now which works great, but it's too heavy for summer (dry skin here). Yeah. It looks pretty. M obsessed with CeraVe‚Äôs Hydrating Cleanser! Feels like I‚Äôm rubbing heaven on my face! Green Clean is a holy grail item for me! Love your routine, products and the color coordination!  And maybe I'm the only one...but the product alignment is giving me like overwhelming anxiety ? I just got the laneige after using farsali for a couple years and I looooooove it. It‚Äôs very cute !! üíöI‚Äôve been looking for an eye cream that‚Äôs hydrating and gentle for sensitive skin. I tried Tatcha silk peony and had the worst reaction „Ö†„Ö°„Ö†      
But Is the farmacy eye cream good ? Did the texture feel heavy ? I just ordered the Centella Sunscreen ! Is it good ? Do you like it ? I have high expectations for this sunscreen, it‚Äôs the first time I buy one after making research :)w I need that glossier rose balm & the laneige makeup serum!! HG products? I will look into this. I‚Äôve been wanting something with rose oil for a while now. I will admit, I am a complete sucker when it comes to pretty packaging & I pick up A LOT of products I probably don‚Äôt need, one of my resolutions this year was to stop doing that lol, but, I think I‚Äôm about to break it. As I said, I need something with rose oil & I do need a new serum. Wow, this all looks so pleasing and luxurious! okai but why would this be a cute eyeshadow pallete?

I'm envisioning a gemini pallete style pink on one end and green on the other,

OR a cheeky wee 6x3 pallete, top row has some pinks mattes, shimmers, some pops of pinks and nudey/pastel pinks (leaking on to the second row) the second row completes itself with a nice brown-y transition and a nice yellow , maybe a yellow-green too(coming from the dew it all cream and the DofE marula oil). Then in the end row we get a nice pastel green, lil pops bright greens and some mattes/ shimmers.

Wow if someone doesn't/hasn't came out with this, I will be upset. I'm terrified of trying moisturizers on my oily acne prone ski because my dermatologist never recommended it. how should I mosturize it without looking like i can fry an egg in my face? This is so gorgeous, my skincare could never look this goodüòÇ Mine are just black and white. üòÇ I've been eyeing Purito's Centella for some time now, how do you like it so far? We have a similar skin type but different routine, mine uses some stronger prescription stuff! https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/iz41k3/shelfie_30f_10step_routine_wtretinoin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

What texture is Saturday Skin? Packaging is so pretty! so pretty! Thanks for all the reviews :) You have a good selection of skincare items I like your taste in products. This is so aesthetically pleasing üòç r/cosmoandwanda Wish I could upvote this into oblivion Ooh I have sensitive skin too! Can you tell me a bit more about the YTTP Adaptogen Cream? Totally agree about the farmacy dew it all eye cream! Nice product but not if you have dark circles üò© I use to love Origin‚Äôs 10min Drink Up mask but they replaced it with something else and it‚Äôs trash now.. still miss that mask( Origins products are totally underrated. Thank you so much for the share. I‚Äôve been eyeing for a new sunscreen and the CeraVe hydrating cleanser. Ive heard the cleanser makes the skin feel tight after? Should you use vit c products if you are using a centella one? how i wish most of these products were available in the UK :( I really like it! I've tried biore aqua rich in the past (my first AB sunscreen) and liked it but found it drying. The Centella one doesn't break me out, feels/looks invisible on the skin, and I haven't noticed any dry patches! Not OP, but I have also tried both biore and purito. I would just add that if you get the purito spf, get the fragrance free version, the scent is really strong (at least for me). But I also love the biore spf, mostly in the summer, because it absorbs fast, the purito one is more like a cream and the biore one more like a gel. Haha yeah the pretty pink glass packaging got me too! I believe it‚Äôs free of synthetic fragrances, but it does have essential oils Thanks! and I would! I like a natural finish for my skin when I'm doing my makeup. The laneige serum is a really nice mix of subtle glow and staying power so my skin looks luminous but not oily throughout the day. It does have silicone in it so be mindful if you have a sensitivity to it! I have redness from acne and mild rosacea! I usually get it on my cheeks, and the laneige product feels really soothing on them and makes my skin look noticeably less red in the morning! I currently don‚Äôt use another toner right now! But in the past I‚Äôve really liked Origins Balancing toner or the Origins MegaMushroom lotion. I‚Äôve always been a little wary of toners since using the bright blue harsh astringent ones for acne in my teens haha Thanks for the recommendation! I‚Äôll have to try TO‚Äôs version when I run out! I‚Äôm surprised how OP can use marula oil at all with acne-prone skin. It‚Äôs rated pretty high as comedogenic. I have a couple bottles because Drunk Elephant loves to throw it in with everything, and my skin hated it. I just use it for my hands and cuticles now. Yes definitely! I can get super dry flakey skin on my cheeks or jawline and this product really helps! I recommend it to all my friends :) The adaptogen line is the first I‚Äôve tried from YTTP and I really like it so far! So moisturizing and light! Thanks for the recommendation, I‚Äôll have to try that mask next time! I think the biggest critique I hear about the cerave is that it leaves a film, but I wouldn‚Äôt really agree with that. It doesn‚Äôt give you that squeaky clean feeling that certain cleansers do, but after you towel dry your face, your skin feels moisturized. It doesn‚Äôt feel like the product left a film on my skin, it just feels like the ceramides did their job :) plus it does a good job cleansing! Gets my makeup off :) It‚Äôs like a mix between a light oil and serum. It says to put it on before moisturizer, and it absorbs really quickly. It doesn‚Äôt feel occlusive like the marula oil or thicker creams!  Also I‚Äôm a sucker for caudalie scents :) I think if you have dry skin you‚Äôd definitely want to follow up with another moisturizer to lock it in! I use the farmacy eye cream daily and have extremely sensitive skin. It‚Äôs not heavy at all for me and causes no irritation. As OP mentioned it doesn‚Äôt do much for dark circles so I won‚Äôt be repurchasing only because of that but if that‚Äôs not a problem for you, I would recommend it! I think it‚Äôs a common misconception that if you‚Äôre oily/acne prone you don‚Äôt need to moisturize. I had really oily tight itchy skin and once I started moisturizing all the extra oil on my skin went away. I‚Äôd look for an oil-free, non-comedogenic, fragrance free moisturizer to start. It does take a little trial and error for everyone though. I started with the cerave moisturizer in the tub, and then switched to FAB repair cream Thank you I really like it!! I just have the mini size but will probably buy the full size when I‚Äôm out. It feels like a super smooth gel cream, and it fully absorbed into the skin nicely and leaves it really smooth and soft. It has the same light herbal scent that the adaptive mist has, which I don‚Äôt mind, plus it dissipates quickly. It also hasn‚Äôt broken me out which is rare for a moisturizer (other than FAB) :) Tarte maracuja eye brightening cream really helps for me! The foaming cleanser makes my skin feel tight but the hydrating cleanser doesn‚Äôt! I‚Äôve been using it for years and I love it. The cerave hydrating cleanser never makes my skin tight! I‚Äôve tried their renewing and foaming version (I think the one with SA) and that one did make my skin feel tight/dry immediately after. I think she is saying she likes to use the Purito Unscented Centella sunscreen when she uses Vit C because Vit C makes our skin more sensitive to UV rays, and maybe she feels like Purito gives her better coverage, or just is less likely to react with the skin-sensitizing Vit C. Thank you for responding :) think I might have to give it a try ! Can I ask why you don't use the Elta when you use vitamin c? Does it sting your eyes? I‚Äôm currently looking for a sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt burn my eyes. Where do you purchase the sunscreen at? Thanks for the suggestion! I‚Äôm really not a fan of scented products at all that would have been an unpleasant surprise Thanks! Adding to my shopping cart. Still trying to find a balance between a nice glow and oily skin... That's great, thank you! I guess we‚Äôre all different right :) it‚Äôs the oil that my skin has loved the most, but then I am naturally quite dry so perhaps that‚Äôs why! I think oils vary a lot from person to person. I‚Äôve tried TO‚Äôs rose hip oil and squalane, and they wreaked havoc on my skin. Herbivore‚Äôs lapis oil used to be my HG, but it kept growing mold in it after only having it for 2 weeks (even though I did my best to keep it sterile). For some reason marula oil just works for me! Thanks for the thorough mini review üòâ Thank you for sharing your insight! I‚Äôll definitely consider purchasing the eye cream ü§ç I just created my account and will proudly join that subreddit as one of my first ten >Vit C because Vit C makes our skin more sensitive to UV rays, and maybe she feels like Purito gives her better coverage, or just is less likely to react with the skin-sensitizing Vit C.

What? All i've heard that one should  put vit C in the AM because it protects against the sun. I could be mistaken but I‚Äôve heard that combining niacinamide and vitamin c makes them both less effective? Since eltaMD has niacinamide in it, I‚Äôve usually just avoided using any products that use vitamin c at the same time. That‚Äôs why I switch between sunscreens. Please anyone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong :) I have super sensitive eyes and I absolutely love the Purito sunscreens. I think they make the SPF in fragrance free as well as scented which has a very mild scent IMO. I purchased both on amazon! I always feel like that‚Äôs risky but both bottles had lot numbers/expiry dates so I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôre not fakes Don‚Äôt you just love it when you find something that WORKS. Such a good feeling isn‚Äôt it :) Yeah, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve learned from this sub, it‚Äôs nice to see how people‚Äôs skin have changed but the same products don‚Äôt work for everyone so you just have to play around and find what works for you. Oops! Learn something new every day. [Vitamin C does not make skin more sensitive to UV](https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vitamin-c-guide-skin-benefits-concentration-absorption) like retinol, but it is recommended to wear it under SPF because Vitamin C becomes less stable in light. Wearing SPF on top helps maintain the stability of the Vit C, the Vit C provides sun protection to your face, and together they provide double protection from UV. Hi! That is based on old data apparently. I‚Äôm not a chemist lol but I got that from this [YouTube video ](https://youtu.be/rSRmjxMDxy8) @ 9:18 Thanks!!! It looks very stylish and tidy! But that mirror seriously tricked me, I thought you had twice as many products lol I like your sneaky hand to take the picture! Those Aƒìsop-looking bottles are so pretty! Are they also expensive? lol shared bathroom cabinet at our place \[36F\] me and my SO

(that creepy all mirror, yeah)

* Safety Skin SPF 30 - for short days out and on-the-go fix. mineral sunblock in a stick, smells with rosemary, hmm
* Safety Skin Reflective spread - reflective wax spreads directly on skin to improve night visibility. washes off easy with soap
* Dulcia zinc ointment - zinc cream for babies, here used for saddle sores
* aloe vera for skin burn
* tea tree oil for insect bites
* Kiki Health Magnesium Spray -  this is gamechanger, magnesium intake thru skin for sore muscles and Mg+ intake against cramps + it makes you sleepy in the eve Thats such beautiful bathroom and shelf... I love the black theme and how much space you've got there. I am jealous... Yeah, this is a Patrick Bateman bathroom. Put your phone away and git /r/mirrorsforsale I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever be able to use all these products within their 12 month BBY dates, much less 6. What's the daylong sunscreen like? Does it burn/tan you easily? Gorge! I‚Äôm really interested in Mylo now! I‚Äôm all about that TIGER BALM üêÖ So pretty üòç As someone who is just getting into taking better care of my skin, I feel I am not doing enough lol Real question: is that plant on your windowsill a peperomia pilea? The one on the right side? Cause it's really pretty Yessss I peep the ISDIN bottle. My favorite spf brand Ikea, is that you? deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4799  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/17912) I lol'd at the tiger balm! How does the safety skin work? I saw it in a running store once and always wondered if it really reflects like it‚Äôs advertised. All of these products make me anxious (not the specific ones but quantity). To me, less is more. [deleted] Good job keeping yourself out of the picture! b&w porn really. love this Is The Ordinary a good brand for a relative newbie? The prices seem very reasonable but I‚Äôm intimidated by the names of the products üò≠ *gasps in admiration and aw* Your shelfie tells me you are stylish, likes black and white and goes to coachella Ano prosim! Prekrasne How many faces do you have??! So stylish and neat! Love the small hand for the picture haha
i'm curious though: how does that mirror stay sparkling clean? or do you have a great cleaning routine? ü§î Is this American psycho ??? = That's a lot of stuff. Do you really use all that every day? My OCD wants to ask if you know all the expiration dates on everything? Omg i love ISDIN sunscreens! Specially the fusion water! Beautiful shelfie I swear ppl who got the most drawn out shit like this always have the shittiest skin lmfaoo. 

This sub needs to require ppl to show their skin when posting a pic like this lol just filter out your eyes. Beautiful üôå My dream cabinet Wooow there is lot of stuff you are using. I realised i dont use anything but bio true and elmex from that cabinetüòÖ haha Ooo I‚Äôve been looking into that sunscreen at the top left. What‚Äôs it like? And is it chemical? Where in Central Europe are you? OMG!! So jealous!!! Is the Biotherm antiperspirant available in the US, do you know? I just recently switched to a natural deodorant but I hate how freaking wet my underarms get at times (particularly when I‚Äôm stressed/excited). I didn‚Äôt realize there were more natural options for antiperspirants. I love all The Ordinary products in this!! I just got Granactive Retinoid to hopefully help with acne scars and spots on my face. Have you had success with it? Prettiest shelfie I‚Äôve seen This is like the Mercedes-Benz of medicine cabinets. Are you sure this is not a store shelf?
/s

Wow, that looked good and the monochromatic look  is also nice. And i see a lot of TO products ‚ù§
May i know how long are you been into skincare for you to accumulate all this products and the issues you have? *Wall [removed] yeah, taking the photo was tricky. i did consider to move the products out toward white background but then i remembered i am lazy .) ü§≥üèº r/mirrorsforsale üôä that‚Äôs the best part, all the Mylo products in aesop looking bottles are similar priced as TO I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs available close to you or how easy it is to obtain in Central Europe, but my favorite sunscreen is EltaMD UV Clear. The whole line is excellent and they have a lot of sunscreens that fit different skin needs. Do you feel like the retin-oil does anything? I have used it so consistently on my body with zero results. At least it smells nice and moisturizes well... Gorgeous, thanks for sharing!!

I'm wondering if the Argireline is working for you?

Do you apply globally or just on your lines? Have you looked into La Roche Posay's Anthelios sunscreen? They have different ones, that's an incredibly popular choice for those based in Europe & it has excellent reviews, esp for the European formulation not available in the US. High marks on ScA for effectiveness, cosmetic elegance, non-greasy, & very waterproof. thank you! monochrome is good üåö üò≥ Lmao Daylong is amazing stuff. By far the most effective and least greasy sunscreen I‚Äôve ever found. Owned by Nestle Skin Health now (manufacturer of Differin and Cetaphil), so distribution is getting better but still quite limited. Generally I get it when in Switzerland or some parts of France. I found it in Australia under the name ‚Äòsuntivity‚Äô also now known as Cetaphil Sun. I normally wear something lighter as an everyday sunscreen but this is amazing for days with any real exposure (I live in a cold, generally cloudy place)... it‚Äôs high spf 50+ and protects my very pale skin with no burn. 4/5 i would say i am a fan. it‚Äôs a small local owned company from Slovakia, the web is not translated, but the ingredients list speak for itself. i like the keep
it simple philosophy When I saw the Mylo labels, I thought it was some new IKEA skincare line Username checks out Less is often more! :) I've personally had better results when just sticking to a simple, bare-bones routine, than a longer and more complicated one. nah, i also had life periods when i don‚Äôt have the mental capacity for this type of self care. 2 years ago, lots of moving, no solid ground in life and l got by with toothbrush and one basic creme. i went full ballistic since having new home üòÖ and more time for everything. be kind to yourself üåö yes, pilea on windowsill detected correctly .) plants are so happy in bathroom godmorgon dana [https://youtu.be/7T2oje4cYxw?t=26](https://youtu.be/7T2oje4cYxw?t=26) haha, a classic! this si the cinnamon version it does work, and is very reflective. look üëÄ compared to reflective shoes and apparel it shines the same on leg 
http://i.imgur.com/6BQ5onq.jpg duh, i am a fan of solid perfumes. they are subtle, easy to carry. no fancy bulk from glass. definitely do not last all day but i prefer that. this smol tin box form lush is 3 years old and still some in. when i grow up, i will buy le labo solid perfume üåö or just an aspie with sensory and visual issues and preferences üåö that will avoid any gatherings with more than 5 people by all means üíÄ dakuje! .) "VERY tasteful" my ODC replies all is within expiry date it‚Äôs the Daylong Sensitive Face SPF 50+ fluid, chemical, emulsion texture and no perfume. it works well, but it‚Äôs more rigid to take off in the eve in US with difficulty, i am afraid. any antiperspirant isn‚Äôt really natural. i also need some days a proper antiperspirant, but will do with natural deodorant on most other days. finding balance is always the thing thank you. started into the skincare, when my life settled cca 2 years ago. i did not do anything to my skin before that. also reminding here, that the cabinet is *shared* .) Hi there,

I'd like to remind you of our Rule 1: Be kind and respectful.

We'd like our sub to be a friendly and welcoming place. That‚Äôs why I want to ask you to refrain from rude or disrespectful comments here. This encompasses rudeness, trolling, and, in general, being disrespectful. Even if you feel strongly about something, please stay polite. 

Thank you! 

For more information, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_1._be_kind_and_respectful.). Lol yeah, I would have remembered the same tbh Yeah i see you hiding to take the picture. That‚Äôs hilarious. You would‚Äôve really tricked everyone if you had used a timed picture then ran out of frame lol Came in to say I love your username, lol from short google it‚Äôs probably gonna be difficult to obtain around here; it‚Äôs a pity, the ingredients look promising. i am definitely putting this on my ‚Äúto snatch while traveling list‚Äù, thank you! i use it over a month and not so consistent. so far no changes for the dark spots, nor scars but definitely helped with texture on my hands. i had ‚Äúold woman‚Äù dehydrated wrinkly skin with visible texture that is getting better towards smoother and softer locally, around eyes, mouth and forehead. i believe it‚Äôs working, subtly. will make before after when i finish this bottle, in few months .) (and i just recently learned it‚Äôs efficient to use water based serums before anything oil based) yes, I had one bottle of anthelios in the past. all you say is correct, but i could not make it my everyday option. clogged my face on long run. last year i went thru Bioderma Photoderm Max, which was bit less clogging. this year i will finish the daylong, that seems so far lighter option from those two. best case scenario would be physical daily SPF. consedering Av√®ne Sun Min√©ral, when i finish this bottle I need to check it out! Also, I thought this post might be from Slovakia just looking at the Elmex toothpaste üòÇ [deleted] That‚Äôs awesome!! I need to educate myself cause I have no idea what aspie means * also english is not my first language* let me research real quick Thank you! Thanks very much! Ha! Don't worry. We have La Roche-Posay for us who live in Europe. The Anthelios Shaka is just the best sunscreen EVER. :) You‚Äôre welcome! It‚Äôs definitely a must Oh okay! I can understand, I did also read the same. I understand if this doesn't suit your preferences, but since I became more serious about sunscreen, I started oil cleansing/double cleansing to remove the sunscreen, since that happens to me with any decent sunscreen anyway is elmex a 'thing'? .) oh, it's handmade done by few folks. their products are fresh made to order and just few stockist sell in Slovakia and Czechia. but they \*do\* ship do Germany on their webshop. PM me if you need translation help .) sorry, my bad. aspie is short for asperger. it‚Äôs used around reddit. i let you google the rest *wink* I mentioned the bisque üëÄ Just came back and yes now I understand but I can't help but picture you as one of theses people based on your shelfie :

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Skin: sensitive, combo with hormonal acne 

Climate: four seasons, going into winter now

Products: 
LRP hydrating gentle cleanser: this is a HG for me. Sooo smooth and simple yet still cleans. I find it way better than the Cerave version. 

LRP toleraine sensitive fluide: a super lightweight serum moisturizer I use to add more niacinamide to my routine. 

Cerave moisturizing lotion: I like this for a basic moisturizer, especially during the winter as it‚Äôs heavier than my usual Cerave PM. 

Financea Azelaic acid cream: this is the only thing that was able to fight off my hormonal acne without making my skin burn or become super red, you do need a prescription which is a downside

Purity comfy water sunblock: this is the only sunscreen I found that doesn‚Äôt leave a white caste, doesn‚Äôt make me super greasy, feels lightweight, and doesn‚Äôt break me out. Love that it‚Äôs mineral too. 

That‚Äôs it, I do this routine every evening. In the morning I just apply my sunscreen, I don‚Äôt wash in the morning as my skin gets easily stripped. Keeping it simple like this has done wonders for my skin. Anytime I try to add other products, I just get breakouts or irritated skin. Idk how everybody keeps having good luck with comfy water. I‚Äôm fair skinned but it still gave me a white cast and pilled terribly!! keeping with the aesthetic, **Mizon**'s ultra suboon cream or one of **Round Lab**'s Dokdo line would make a nice edition. Love the mini-reviews of the products btw I got prescribed finacea gel a couple of days ago for the exact same reason, everything else was making my skin soo dry and sensitive, I‚Äôm wondering how long did it take for you to clear up your skin with it? Also works for Vanicream! The other blue/white/gentle and HG for me ;) I've been wanting to try that sunscreen because I look like a goddamn oil slick everyday putting on my sunscreen lol Do you find that your skin pills after using the Comfy Water Sun Block?? Also how does makeup sit on top for you?? How has your experience on finacea been so far? 

I use tretinoin at night but I'm going to ask my derm if I can try it out and incorporate it into my routine at my next appointment. I really hope he says yes, because I have so much PIE/PIH. How long have you been using the Purrito? I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews The comfy water sunscreen is my holy grail! I love love love it. It‚Äôs the only mineral sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt dry out my skin. lol my whole skincare cupboard is also white-blue and some just because its all gentle productsüòÇ So aesthetically pleasing Seeing this pleases my OCD ~ When and how do you use the healing ointment from Cerave? What are your thoughts? Love the LRP cleanser!  I agree it is better than the Cerave one, and the Cerave one broke me out, too. Love the LRP cleanser! And it's cheaper than Cerave as well. To be honest, I strongly believe the vast majority of people are under-applying it. Mine pills too!! Glad it's not just me üòÇ It did take a little bit, about 2 months to see full results I was the same before! I haven‚Äôt had any pilling with it, I have not tried makeup on top though. A powder foundation would prob do better with it. It‚Äôs been great. No irritation with it for me. It does take about two months to start seeing results though. I also love that it seems to help control my oil too. I‚Äôve used it for two weeks now. I think it‚Äôs great so far, but I‚Äôm not sure how well it plays with other products if you layer a lot in the morning. I use the healing ointment for my lips and sometimes any dry areas in the winter. Love it I apply the correct amount and I get initially a whitecast but it does fade away after 10 min (I am also very pale) but it does pill which sucks :/ I strongly believe people are buying fakes on amazon. 

Fitzpatrick 3 and I use the three finger method for comfy water- no pilling no white cast. I'm fair too (Fitzpatrick 1) and I got a cast also. I prefer tinted mineral sunscreens tbh. Finding the right tint is a quest in and of itself however... Mine was from Yesstyle. I believe it‚Äôs more of a product consistency issue than a fake product issue I ordered mine from Stylevana, so pretty sure it's not a fake ü§∑ It is possible... I use the cerave 50+ mineral sunscreen which is terrible for a white cast but I now add it to the IT CC cream 50+ in a shade slightly darker than my skin tone (I'm olive) and it works a treat. Both have ceramides + niacinamide I believe, and blend together very easily on my fingertips.

Just in case that is helpful for you! **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

concern: dry patches, dehydration, random breakouts.

‚ú®‚ú®



routine

gentle & gets the job done.

spray mist of Avene thermal spring water
calming feeling on just-washed face.

let soak in, apply clindamycin phosphate 1% pledget 
prescribed by my derm, necessary every morning to avoid itchiness/irritation.

let dry and apply 2 pumps avene a-oxidative serum
this serum absorbs into my skin SO quickly and has great ingredients- vitamin C, hyaluranic acid, etc. 

apply caffeine eye cream
have noticed decrease in dark circles over 2 month period so far.

mix 1 pump la roche posay tolerating ULTRA moisturizer and one drop vitamin e oil
this moisturizer is my HOLY GRAIL i love the consistency. added vitamin e oil recently due to cold weather change.

let soak in, apply supergoop unseen sunscreen 
love the consistency of this sunscreen (almost feels like a primer?) thinking of trying the glow-screen next.


laneige lip mask ALL DAY ERR DAY üòô 


PM:
(not pictured) la roche posay micellar water (wipe with cotton round) to get off makeup if i decided to wear some that day.

oil cleanse with mad hippie
not crazy about this, in the market for a new one... possibly the inkey list oat balm cleanser üëÄ

wash with simple moisturizing face wash (not pictured)

spray mist with avene thermal spring water.

All 3 used below as a treatment alone, never together. 

tretinoin .025% 2-3x a week used over one pump of moisturizer 
prescribed by my derm, cleared up my under-the-skin acne in about 3 months.

paulas choice 2% BHA liquid exfoliant 2-3x a week
love how *tingly* this feels on my skin.

dr. dennis gross clarifying mask 1-2x a week if noticeable breakout colloidal sulfur ingredients super effective.

hydrapatches used to fade a noticeable acne scar, but unfortunately, they haven‚Äôt done much for me. 

additional notes: looking to possibly add the cosrx snail mucin serum into my routine for added hydration, but not sure how my sensitive skin would react. Why is sunscreen in the shower? Unrelated but where did you get that shelf? Does that make you a witch a la r/witchesvspatriarchy üòÅ My partner says potions, too! AHAHA my bf calls them that too I also have Clindamycin! I‚Äôve been using it for about a month and a half. Not a great ton of results so far but hoping! what do you think about the avene a-oxidative serum? I used mine almost up and did nothing for my skin sadly... i really want to purchase another vitamin c serum but I don't know what to do... Would you recommend the eye cream?? I've been looking at it for a while but I'm a bit sceptical your bf doesnt do skincare? 5-in-1 shampoo is more of a potion imo üò≥ is the paulas choice bha exfoliant worth it? [removed] if i could only bring 5 things into battle...
1. clindamycin phosphate pledgets (am)
2. avene a-oxidative serum (am/pm)
3. la roche posay ultra moisturizer (am/pm)
4. tretinoin (pm)
5. supergoop sunscreen üòé This looks great... thank you for sharing! It‚Äôs amazing for sensitive skin! I HIGHLY recommend the snail mucin this is near my sink! ü§£ That was my first thought too ! the company is called frontgate, but they don‚Äôt make that style shelf anymore unfortunately :( absolutely üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i‚Äôve been using mine for about that long too. are you consistent with it? my dermatologist recommended it every morning after I wash my face for my mild acne, and I notice a tingling/calming effect especially when i do have a breakout on my face. my skin seems to really like it & soaks it up almost instantly when i apply it. it‚Äôs definitely one of my holy grails! also- I know so many people love the sunday riley vitamin C brightening serum, but is quite expensive! I think it‚Äôs pretty good for the price! I haven‚Äôt found an eye cream that has blown me away without fragrance/irritants so i‚Äôm pretty pleased with this one üôÇ I don‚Äôt think he really cares for it. he gets the rare pimple here and there and really just washes his face in the shower- imagine üôÑ he is a very sanitary person though. I personally really like to use it in conjunction with my tretinoin to get all the dead skin off (but never together in the same night). can be a bit harsh (for my sensitive skin) in the colder months so I have been using it less frequently recently.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Radiation Therapist here. We recommend Aquaphor for all our patients! We even give them a coupon book for the various types. We love our Aquaphor! ü•∞ My mom had cancer in her lymphnodes (not quite throat cancer but I say throat cancer if someone asks generally because it's easier) and she used SO MUCH AQUAPHOR for her scarring and radiation marks (the redness rash stuff). She's about 3 years post radiation/chemo and you barely notice anymore! She never used any sort of scar lotion besides aquaphor. A true miracle worker That cream actually has good ingredients too and no fragrance. I was surprised when I read the ingredient list. A lot of hospitals use them Aquaphor is the best. If you have a baby, you have to use it for diaper rash. Best thing you could do He uses these both AM and PM to combat burns (I guess?) from radiation treatment. That aquaphor has helped me so much with so many different skin problems. Last winter, I had huge patches of dark brown spots all over my hands and arms. I believe from extreme dryness due to weather. No amount of regular lotion did anything for it. I put that aquaphor on for a couple of days, boom gone. I've never used Aquaphor. Can anyone give me good recs on how and where to use it? Can you put it on your face? Sorry, kind of a noob! Aquaphor is great. All the best for you and your dad! I have a question about aquaphor! Does it moisturize the area or just lock in the existing moisture from the skin? My skin is so dry it‚Äôs peeling if it gets any kind of friction, I don‚Äôt know what to do with it because I‚Äôve never had dry skin before. I have a small bottle I‚Äôve been using for my lips because the skin is tight,shiny, and puffy but idk if it‚Äôs actually helping. RTT here too üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è aquaphor is life, especially in the winter! Did your mom experience her skin stretching out to be kind of "turkey neck-ish"? That's what my dad is dealing with on top of the rash/scaliness and he's so worried it'll never go back to normal Once I was at work and my hands were cracked and horrible from handwashing and I had forgotten my lotion. In desperation I used some of this and I loved it so much I ended up ordering some off Amazon. It's one of the few things that controls the roseacea flakes for me. Yes we use this at my hospital and I love it so much! Aquaphor is an occlusive so it does just what you said, which is to lock in the existing moisture! Generally, you want to apply your moisturizer first and then layer the Aquaphor on top to seal everything in. I use it on my lips as well because I have OCD and I tend to bite my lips until they get sore and bloody and Aquaphor heals them. I also use it on my face at night after I apply my moisturizer and I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs helped a ton with PIH I have on my cheeks from acne. No but she also had surgery to remove the problem lymphnodes.. so she has a pretty large scar from her jaw-ish to almost her clavicle. I feel like that may have affected how her skin lays on her neck now? Yeah we use it at mine too. This one and a blue one (more occlusive imo) Oh how interesting! That makes sense, since I noticed my lips never felt more moisturized if I put on. I figured it wasn‚Äôt working (¬∞u¬∞‚Äú) I‚Äôve been using Vaseline at night but during the day I generally just apply my moisturizer in two steps, then sunscreen. I‚Äôm happy to hear you say that you use sunscreen! Whenever I would get a chemical burn I would apply Vaseline on my face nightly and it always healed my skin within a few days. It was also a lifesaver when I was using Tretinoin because it helped with the peeling stage. I‚Äôve noticed that applying straight Aquaphor on my skin without a moisturizer causes my skin to become dry so I always use the cerave daily lotion first, since it has ceramides for your skin barrier and hyaluronic acid, and then the Aquaphor and my skin is always glowy when I wake up. I was surprised at the fact that it works so well for acne scars too. I‚Äôve used glycolic acid, niacinamide, and the AHA + BHA peel and none of them produced results as fast as aquaphor. The first morning I woke up and looked at my skin after I used it, I saw a huuuuge and noticeable difference. I always recommend Aquaphor because it‚Äôs such a great product but I know lots of people like the cerave healing ointment or pure Vaseline too. Of course! I currently hate my sunscreen with a burning passion so I‚Äôve been applying it extra consistently so I can get through it faster and get a different one haha At night I currently use a very small amount of of Shea butter as a barrier of my nose and eyes, tret, Versed Skin Soak as a moisturizer, then a vaseline coat. I love Vaseline. I had a gnarly second degree burn at the beginning of quarantine that healed way better than I expected because of it. Yes! Vaseline has always been a lifesaver for me and it always came in handy for a multitude of things. My grandma used Vaseline and ponds cold cream when she was around my age and her skin is beautiful. For sunscreen, I personally prefer clear ones because I hate when they leave behind a white cast. I typically use the glossier sunscreen but the bottle is so small and I go through them quickly so I‚Äôm in the process of looking for another one. I‚Äôve heard Paula‚Äôs choice has a good sunscreen but $46 is pricy for sunscreen and Neutrogena‚Äôs products break me out so I wouldn‚Äôt dare go that route. I prefer clear sunscreens too. I used supergoops sunscreen in the past and didn‚Äôt mind that too much but it didn‚Äôt agree with my other skincare products at the time. Since I‚Äôve changed my routine I might try it again. Right now I‚Äôm using EltaMd tinted sunscreen and their original physical sunscreen. Leaves me like an oil slick and that‚Äôs after it‚Äôs pilled up on itself. It doesn‚Äôt even stay on so if you try to put makeup on afterwards it slips right off your face. Are there any other clear sunscreens you‚Äôre eyeing? I have combo skin so I typically get oily in the middle of my forehead and the sides of my nose. I hate with a burning passion when sunscreens or moisturizers sit on top of my skin and don‚Äôt fully absorb. I was looking at the ‚ÄúInvisiblur Perfecting Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 30‚Äù clear sunscreen by Murad but it‚Äôs $65 and I‚Äôm not entirely comfortable with paying that much for a sunscreen. I don‚Äôt know or understand why it‚Äôs so hard to find a clear sunscreen that‚Äôs affordable. Kylie skin has one too and it‚Äôs supposedly the same formula as supergoop plus it‚Äôs only $3 more than the one from glossier that I normally get, but after my negative experience with her skincare products I‚Äôm not inclined to purchase that one either. I wouldn‚Äôt touch Kylies skin care with a ten foot pole, so I don‚Äôt blame you. I‚Äôve had good experiences with Murad in the past. Too bad they‚Äôre not giving out samples anymore so you can try it out. They were pretty agreeable when my skin was oily/normal on their moisturizer front. Almost immediately absorbed into my skin. I think it‚Äôs because of the new trend in ‚Äúnatural‚Äù ‚Äúchem free‚Äù skincare which is barf because it‚Äôs so fake. Clear sunscreens are the bees knees. I wish there were more of them. Quick reminder that the first rule on this sub is [Rule 1: Be kind and respectful](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rule_overview#wiki_rule_1.3A_be_kind_and_respectful). 

The comment section got a little weird here, and I'd like to apologize to OP. 

It's clear that a similarly titled post the other day came across as peacocking, and that annoyance is being directed here as well. It's also clear that OP isn't trying to brag, just using "Ph.D student" as shorthand for "money's tight, time's tight, but hot damn the stress is flowing!". 

It's important to assume good intent, especially online where it's difficult to tell tone through text. There's a human at the other end of the screen, and the world could do with a little more empathy.

And at the end of the day, it's skincare. We're all here to learn, help others, and lift each other up. I say this too much, but when in doubt, channel Bob Ross :)

Edit: specially >> *e*specially [removed] [removed] How are you finding the Buffet? Love how simple it is - I recently switched from Pond‚Äôs cleansing balm though because I found out it has polyethylene, which when you wash it down the drain can later damage marine life ): Are we all gonna post our occupations and most recently obtained degree with our routines now? Talk about getting green damn Where do you buy your biore watery essence?? I was going to buy from overlord Jeff Bezos, but the recent reviews sounded like they changed their formula. You have to use more than a dime of sunscreen I have been paring down my skincare routine over the past years to only include what really works for me and products that I genuinely love and repurchase time and time again. I‚Äôm a 27 year old Ph.D. student, and my research is in air pollution toxicology. I spend long hours in the lab, and am outdoors daily, commuting in the dry and sunny SoCal climate.

**Skin Type:** Dry/combination, sensitive.

**Concerns:** Having enough hydration is my usual main concern.

**Goals:** Hydrating the skin, preventing breakouts from not washing enough, sun protection, and having a moisturized and smooth base for makeup application.

**AM Routine:**

* ***Washing face with lukewarm water:*** I have found that I personally do not need to wash my face in the mornings with any soap product.
* ***First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads:*** I take a wipe and swipe it all over my face, starting at the forehead region, where I can sometimes get tiny bumps. It helps add some hydration to the freshly washed face, and also gently exfoliates.
* ***The Ordinary Buffet:*** 2 drops that I pat onto my face. It‚Äôs made to prevent aging through the incorporation of amino acids, but I also enjoy the hydrating effect it has due to the hyaluronic acid.
* ***First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream:*** Dab onto my forehead, cheeks, and chin, then spread evenly. Locks in hydration, is formulated to be gentle for sensitive skin, and it‚Äôs a very effective moisturizing base for my makeup style (mainly cream products, natural look).
* ***Biore UV Watery Essence:*** Take a dime-sized amount and spread evenly. A hydrating, effective sunscreen that does not leave a white cast.

**PM Routine:**

* ***Pond‚Äôs Cleansing Balm:*** Gently massage it to remove my waterproof makeup as well as almost all of the rest of my makeup. It melts off makeup effectively, leaving behind no residues, and washes off easily with warm water.
* ***First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser:*** A 2nd cleanse to remove anything that remains.
* ***First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads:*** I take a wipe and swipe it all over my face, starting at the forehead region, where I can sometimes get tiny bumps. It helps add some hydration to the freshly washed face, and also gently exfoliates.
* ***The Ordinary Buffet:*** 2 drops that I pat onto my face. It‚Äôs made to prevent aging through the incorporation of amino acids, but I also enjoy the hydrating effect it has due to the hyaluronic acid.
* ***First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream:*** Dab onto my forehead, cheeks, and chin, then spread evenly. Locks in hydration, is formulated to be gentle for sensitive skin.

**My Top 3 Favorite Products in my Shelfie:**

1. ***Pond‚Äôs Cleansing Balm***: I am an almost-daily makeup-wearer. I have thoroughly used most of the major makeup removing balms on the market. From Farmacy Green Clean, Banila Co. Clean It Zero, Clinique Take the Day Off, Derma E Universal Cleansing Balm, Drunk Elephant Slaai. The Pond‚Äôs Cleansing Balm is by FAR one of the most cost-effective ones (very important for me as a grad student on a budgeted stipend) and is extremely gentle, even for the eye area. I develop atopic dermatitis on my eyelids very easily, so I need a gentle cleansing balm that removes my eye makeup effectively. It has very little to no ‚Äúeye clouding‚Äù when using, and a tub lasts for a good 4-5 months or so. It removes my eye makeup, lash primer, waterproof mascara, and other makeup effectively with no raccoon-eye effect. The packaging is acceptably aesthetically pleasing and inoffensive on my shelf. It‚Äôs sturdy, and survives plenty of drops in the shower. It is a very similar consistency to the Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Cleansing Balm, but is a bit softer, and is white, not pale green. There is no discernible smell. I don‚Äôt see any reason to spend any more on makeup cleansing balms than $9 for this tub of amazingly effective product. This product is a no-brainer for me to include as my ultimate top favorite product in my top 3.
2. ***Biore UV Watery Essence:*** I have to give 2nd place to this incredible sunscreen from my native land. I have my parents purchase this for me, or I order it on YesStyle. The best sunscreen I‚Äôve ever used in my entire life. The packaging is a sleek and stylish reflective blue. The product has a creamy yellow tint and has an extremely pleasant, light, refreshing, almost candy-citrus scent. It is hydrating and soaks up into the skin, leaving my skin with a healthy, subtle glow. There is no white cast that you‚Äôd get from other traditional sunscreens. I grew up seeing Biore commercials on TV and it‚Äôs so cool to me, and a source of pride, that this product is so popular in the U.S.!
3. ***First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream***: I eagerly give 3rd place to this tried-and-true moisturizer from FAB. This moisturizer is definitely on the thicker side, but as someone with dry skin, it‚Äôs exactly what I need to finish up my skincare routine and lock in hydration. It‚Äôs very gentle, and is the only moisturizer I‚Äôve felt comfortable gently using on my eyelids (I don‚Äôt dabble in eye creams) when I have some issues with dermatitis or if I develop a dry ‚Äústress patch‚Äù on my eyelid. This FAB Ultra Repair Cream also works very well to soothe irritated skin related to shaving accidents or the occasional burn from the kitchen or curling wand. There are absolutely no negative points to this product. I love the Bior√© sunscreen, have you tried the Peony limited edition? Smells like heaven (and peonies :)) 

I also use the FAB ultra repair cream even though I have combo skin and it is summer right now. Somehow it does not feel heavy, but nicely refreshing, and it dries more or less matte on me - depending how much I use of course. Hey op, sorry for the shit you're getting from people.  I really hope you don't leave because of it; your thoughtful replies and forgiving attitude are really appreciated and important.  

Just wanted to say that the general rule of thumb with sunscreen is to apply 1/2 tsp to your face, another for your neck, and another for your chest.  If you want to get super accurate and measure exactly how much you need, there's a great video where labmuffinbeauty, a chemistry PhD holder lol, measures her own face.  Sunscreens are tested with a measurement of 2mg/cm squared.  If you use less than this, you won't be getting the spf listed on the label.  

If you apply the "correct" amount of sunscreen  everyday for a month, you'd go through almost one tube of the biore one, which is why it's too expensive for some people even though a single tube seems really affordable.  

There's also a ton of debate around the applicable ratings for american sunscreens, asian sunscreens, and European sunscreens because the testing is so varied for certain uv wavelengths but I don't want to confuse you too much haha.  

Anyways, much love and good luck in your skincare journey, even if this sub can no longer be a part of it for you ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Damn everyone on here so salty about PhD students... sorry op. I like your routine! I think people got triggered bc of the title and last weeks med student post. Yikes. Anyways , good stuff. Seeing your positive replies to snarky ppl gives me hope for humanity I love the FAB Cleanser! I usually use Farmacy Green Clean to remove makeup but I'm curious about the Ponds one. I've never seen it. I see "as a busy mom" or "as a stressed out key worker" and the like all the time. Literally no different that OP putting "phd student". OP has been nothing but polite in all the responses and not bragging at all.  People in here are just jealous AF. I don‚Äôt know why people are being so mean to you on this sub. I‚Äôve never seen this before. I love FAB products too. They work so well on my dry skin and heal any dry patches. Appreciate your comments and sharing your routine. You can probably tell from my replies to comments already that I‚Äôm really sorry people gave you such a hard time. It really saddens me to see people have such hatred with such a little amount of information they have about you in a thread that‚Äôs supposed to be supportive and wholesome. I am glad to see your routine, I‚Äôm still figuring my skin out so it‚Äôs nice to see what works for you and what doesn‚Äôt I‚Äôve been looking for a super light non greasy sunscreen to wear daily, I might have to check out this one!  I‚Äôd never heard of it before seeing it in your post.    Thanks for sharing :) sorry so many people are being jerks to you, I guess it‚Äôs okay for people to flex their grotesquely expensive skincare routines on here but not their academic achievements üôÑwho knew lol Is the ponds cleansing balm different than the cleansing cream, or same product but in different packaging? I've never seen the balm before! How do you like ponds cleansing balm? Is it the same as high end ones like farmacy green clean? Wow, it took your post for me to realize that there are a lot of hateful people on the sub. I'm sorry you're getting so much unnecessary snark. hey there, love the shelfie! it‚Äôs nice to see a simple routine, and i‚Äôve been trying the FAB moisturizer myself! the biore sunscreen is next on my to-try list too. are the radiance pads like the stridex or cosrx pads? i‚Äôd be interested in trying them, but i do tend to have sensitive skin. sorry for all the hate you seem to be getting :( i think pursuing a phd is great and it sounded like this was a routine for someone who might be on a tighter budget like a phd student. it‚Äôs a shame that you‚Äôre getting so much snark for it + hope you‚Äôre doing well! How many times do you apply your sunscreen in a day? Thanks for sharing!

Plenty of others have already said this, but I'm sorry for the way you were treated about being a PhD student, it's completely uncalled for (I'm biased though, as I'm also a PhD student). It's relevant in the context of wanting to keep things simple, from a time and money perspective. God knows I don't have the time or money for a 10 step fancy Korean beauty routine, and I've recently simplified my own routine too!

Good luck with the PhD, your skin, and your happiness! Don't let the negativity bring you down (in this comment section, or anywhere else). Fellow PhD student here! Love the Ponds cleansing balm too -- it's unbeatable for price per ounce. Best part is it's travel sized, so I don't need to depot when flying! I love the products you are using! I have already graduated and earned my PHD I'm excited to share my routine. <3 "It's also clear that OP isn't trying to brag, just using "Ph.D student" as shorthand for "money's tight, time's tight, but hot damn the stress is flowing!"." YES. Feels like people here are taking their own personal problems/grievances out on OP, who now probably has an awful opinion of this sub and the people on it.

I'm finding it to be perfectly acceptable and useful when it comes to giving my skin that extra hydration before I apply the FAB Ultra Repair Cream moisturizer to lock it all in. 

However, I think I will repurchase the "Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%" in the future. It's less than half the price and I think it works just as well. Being totally honest here. :) Viscous/liquid polyethylene in cosmetics is very different from polyethylene microbeads and other solid plastics, and has not been shown (as far as I've seen) to be linked to plastics pollution in our oceans. The higher density polyethylenes of micro size found in microbeads/scrubs and plastic tubs are the ones shown to be adversely degrading into the environment and should be avoided. I don't think there exists any literature that specifically cover the impact of the liquid/non solid polyethylenes in cosmetic formulations, unless you know of some? I'm genuinely interested. Banila Clean It Zero is polyethylene free :) Ooh, thanks for the heads up. This is exactly the kind of information and conversations I wanted to have from posting on this sub. :) "As a college drop out, I spend 10 hours a day researching skincare ingredients and the best products out there. This is my routine"

isn't it much more compelling? haha My post would look something like:

"As a fourth year BSW student, here is my routine!" with a photo containing only a bottle of wine. [removed] only if its STEM!!!!! A lot of graduate students are like this. In undergrad I took a master's level course at the professor's invitation. Once the other students learned I was not a grad student, there were several times where they would go around the table (before prof arrived) and ask me why I thought I deserved to be there.

I recall in my end of semester presentation that one of my classmates laughed through it, although they did not try to refute any of my points or ask any questions - most likely because they couldn't.

This attitude is pretty ubiquitous among grad students in my experience. And it's not just toward undergrad students. If you're a M.S. or M.A. student, then you're just wasting your time compared to a PhD. If you're a humanities student, then your program is a joke compared to STEM. If you're in STEM, then your worth is determined by the job market value of your degree. I went to trade school.  I‚Äôm going to post my welding certs with my skincare routine. Is that something commonly done here? If it is, I'm all for it!  

I'm totally new to this sub, first time posting, and I just included that I'm a Ph.D. student because it's obviously a huge part of my life right now, and wanted to give context to the priorities that I have when it comes to choosing my skincare products! :) I get it from YesStyle, and sometimes when my family in Japan sends me stuff, they send me a couple bottles of it. YesStyle has some great sales and the price goes down a lot! Ooh, thanks for the heads up! Definitely good to do that... Hey OP!

I think that sunscreen is the best I've ever used. I wish it were cheaper! 

I find the FAB ultra repair cream an excellent moisturiser but I've had problems layering it, which is frustrating. It seems this is not an issue for you? Still, I'll keep trying because I am a maniac who bought three massive tubes on sale.

Ps. Congrats on your studies. I have a PhD and it was REALLY HARD and I am REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF. sorry that had to be an issue, this community is actually really nice most of the time! I have not, I would love to try that version of the sunscreen! I love floral scents. Thank you for the super informative comment, wow that is a lot of sunscreen for sure! I always have known that you should put on more sunscreen that you'd "think", but I definitely need to do more learning about that so I feel confident about having sun protection. 

Also, thank you for the kind words. Today was a little too much for me, especially with this being my first post and first real visit here. [removed] I gotta give it to Farmacy, their Green Clean is amazing. I loved everything about it. The scent, efficacy, aesthetics. But I am a Pond's lady now, through and through. I discovered the Pond's Cleansing Balm randomly in a CVS a year or two ago, and now it's the only cleansing balm I use to remove my makeup! It's just so cost-effective...and effective. :)

Thank you for the tip! I love getting First Aid Beauty products on sale from Ulta and Sephora, and many times in those gift sets that contain full-sizes and trial sizes. I think I got the Fablantis ($49) set from Sephora most recently, during some sort of sale. I'll keep that discount in mind for the future. Oh also, I saw you were a Grad student. If you have a student ID sephora is giving 15% off First Aid Beauty  to college students with your student ID. ALL üëèüèæ THE üëèüèæ TIME üëèüèæ I don't know why either, and I'm seriously so sad, I was really looking forward to the discussions today.

But I'm so glad you liked FAB too, and that my comments helped you in any way. :) Also came here to say this! Very wild this sub is getting heated over something so silly? I am also a grad student studying engineering, so I know how working in lab and what not can be very time consuming, so I feel you on keeping up with simple routine! I am also close in age to you & love FAB! Also, don‚Äôt let these comments get you down! Jealousy sucks, but you‚Äôre a boss :) Thank you. I appreciate your comments greatly. 

Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions about any of the things in the pic! You're welcome, I'm glad it could help. Yeah that sunscreen is really great! Please let me know if you have any trouble finding it online. I usually order it from YesStyle, they have great sales a few times a year. 

And thank you, I'm trying to stick to answering skincare-related questions because that's what I'm here for. :) This is definitely the sunscreen for you if you want light and non greasy (: hope it works out! I have personally not tried the Pond's Cleansing Cream (I assume you mean the Cleansing Cold Cream) in many, many years, so I cannot give you a very informed opinion on it. 

The Cleansing Balm is less like a Cold Cream, and more like the newer-age cleansing balms you'd find on the market (harder, less creamy, not an opaque white), and melts off makeup through gentle massaging of the areas you want to clean off.

You may be able to find some YouTube videos or blog posts describing the differences! I included a review of my thoughts on the Pond's Cleansing Balm in my informational comment, feel free to read there! Exactly what I was going to say. I read the title and assumed "PhD student" equated to "busy and stressed and maybe money is tight" not "flexing". People are SO rude! Thank you for your thoughtful comment. This is my first time on the sub and my first time posting. This subreddit's response towards my post has been nothing I'd ever expected and it's seriously ruined my day. 

I was really looking forward to posting here and getting some constructive feedback on my skincare routine, which I had curated over the years. That was it. I thought it would be educational and help me grow as a skincare user.

Mentioning the fact that I'm a Ph.D. student in any other sub (TV show subreddits, video game subreddits, AskWomen, fashion subreddits) has never been taken this poorly. I looked at the med student's shelfie from a couple days ago and see similar snark. Clearly, we mention those things to abbreviate having to mention we're (1) on a budget, (2) don't necessarily have a ton of time, and (3) we may be able to help further discussion through perusing peer-reviewed literature together or help explain labels/chemicals. 

It all clearly breaks Rule #1:

>We'd like this sub to be a friendly and welcoming place. That's why we ask everyone to be kind and respectful to each other. We ask you to be polite and to not make rude or hurtful remarks about who someone is or the choices they've made - even if you might disagree with it!  
>  
>When you‚Äôre having a discussion with someone, try to assume good intent, even if you don‚Äôt understand why someone is acting this way. Most people think that what they think is correct and what they do is okay; they don‚Äôt set out to spread misinformation on purpose, or to make a post or comment that‚Äôs somehow not appropriate.  
>  
>So even if you are completely unable to imagine the reasoning behind what someone does or says, stay polite and discuss the impact of their words - not the assumed intent behind them. You can know whether something is true or how it makes you feel, but you can't know the reason someone said it. So try to focus on the impact rather than the intent and stay calm and respectful. If this isn‚Äôt a conversation you want to have, or if you‚Äôre not able to refrain from snark or rudeness, remember that you can walk away!

I even messaged the mods about it because I'm just blown away by how hateful and rude people have been just because I mentioned I was a Ph.D. student. No response from them yet. 

It's left a bad taste in my mouth and I honestly don't want to post or contribute on this sub after this post. Not worth it. Yeah like damn, can‚Äôt people be proud of what they do? It‚Äôs less of a flex than people showing their all high end product ‚Äúshelfies‚Äù. Hi, thanks for the kind comment! I hope you are liking the FAB moisturizer, it's really handy to have around.

So I only have experience using the Stridex "Maximum" Acne Care Soft Touch Pads, and the main/active ingredient is 2% Salicylic Acid, which is a BHA (Beta-Hydroxy Acid). It's more oftentimes associated with acne treatment, but it also has good benefits like unclogging pores, gentle exfoliation, etc. I use those when my forehead bumps get a bit too out of control, but I don't usually have them on hand.

On the other hand, the FAB Facial Radiance Pads have Lactic and Glycolic Acid, which are both AHAs (Alpha-Hydroxy Acid). I don't know the percentages of each of those off the top of my head, but they are also exfoliating, and are (in my opinion) something I feel comfortable using AM and PM daily. It helps prevent new acne and keeps my skin smooth. It's the only "chemical exfoliation" product I use regularly and it's gentle enough for me to rely on it daily!

If I recall correctly, the Stridex Acne Pads have a little crescent shape cut out of the bottom of the circular pad, so it's like a little handle region. Whereas, the FAB Facial Radiance Pads are just a plain circle. They feel pretty similarly on the face so it's really just about the ingredients and what you want as a result.

Edit: I hope you're doing well, too. Please take care. :) Once, in the AM. My excuse for this is that I'm indoors all day long in the research laboratory which does not have windows, and I only commute for 10 minutes each way outdoors. :p

But, I'd love to learn about what people think are better practices with anything in my skincare routine! That's why I posted here. Thank you so much! I really appreciate your kind comment. I'm proud of where I am in life and I won't let some jealous trolls let me down! üôÇ I don't know why you're being downvoted (I'm new to this sub and am not aware of all the nuances), but I agree, I have chucked it into my travel bag for research conferences and stuff and it's been fine. It's just under the TSA liquids limit, at 3.38 ounces! It's seriously the best cleansing balm and so cost-effective! again, downvotes? on a positive comment? y‚Äôall mad mad lmao I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve gotten so many downvotes for a positive comment. It‚Äôs childish and immature and frankly just makes them look jealous. People go through so so much to get good educations. 

Assuming that someone is smug, acting superior, or otherwise privileged just because they have a PhD is absolutely ignorant. I am getting my b.a. and i assure you if I continue my education I will be damn proud of it because it‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs time consuming, and ffs it does affect your skincare routine because it is stressful and leaves little time in your day. Y‚Äôall who downvoted this. I am not privileged because of my education. I grew up in a single parent home, my mom without a proper paycheck, 2 siblings, no money for college. 200% below poverty line in US. I worked, I got scholarships. If I continue I‚Äôll do the same. It‚Äôs not easy being a student. Not everyone who is a student has it easy, and that affects every aspect of their life sometimes. it is literally a part of you and how you handle things like skincare because skincare costs money, and takes time. why are you mad? why? you don‚Äôt know this person or their background. I doubt my impression of each and every person in this thread would be accurate based on one sentence of your background. but guess what! I don‚Äôt post nasty comments when I have that tiny amount of info.

if you can‚Äôt be nice, don‚Äôt say it at all. doesn‚Äôt take a PhD to know that, I was taught that even before school. Wow, congratulations!! That is awesome. Would love to see it. Yeah this comment section became quite unnecessarily defensive. OP was never out here to make you feel small, but having a knee jerk aggressive reaction can certainly make you look it. Let‚Äôs stay a positive community and try to assume the best in people unless given concrete evidence otherwise. They could have just said student. Lots of PhD students get paid to do research and to be a TA, and therefore they often have more money than undergraduate students. So the niacinamide offers the same benefits/the same level of hydration?? That‚Äôs an good point. I‚Äôll check and come back with updates! Sure! I switched to Neutrogena‚Äôs makeup melting balm, which is a little harder to get all the way off but worth it to me for the fishies. (: [removed] I snorted when I read this üòÇ Hi post graduate BSW student here. Good luck finding work, because almost everything other than CPS requires an MSW - I hate it here üôÉ [removed] Depending on what the bachelors is...bachelors of arts...fuck no...bachelors of hard science, YES A PhD is a type of degree, it doesn't necessarily mean it's stem. Damn this turned into one big circle jerk. Sorry for what happened to you in undergrad but it‚Äôs time to move on & let go. Keep this stuff out of skincare addiction, because in turn you‚Äôre doing exactly what your calling op out on. PhD students have feelings too I'm so sorry that happened to you and that the professor tolerated it! I wasn't going to mention this for obvious reasons, but I am actually a STEM PhD so I've seen some of the attitude you're talking about (and I guess that's why this post and the other similar ones bugged me). IDK why some people don't know that it's possible to be proud of yourself and like your job and not be a snob all the time. That is truly terrible and sounds like a nightmare. Hopefully those assholes matured. 

But what does that have to do with OP? YES!  I have an MBA, which is never quite good enough for those types. [removed] Yes, there was a post the other day where the person felt the need to include that they were a med student. I'm sorry for being kind of rude, I just felt like it wasn't a trend that needed to catch on. I can see how it can be relevant that you are a busy student, or perhaps someone might say "I'm a chemist, so I read up on the literature on X ingredient," but for the most part it just reads like a flex. Thank you so much!! You have to slather it on to make sure it works at the SPF it lists - makes it even more annoying that they come in tiny bottles. For my whole face and neck, I use, like... 1.5 the size of a quarter. [removed] Yeah, I wish it were cheaper, too. You can find it on sale on YesStyle many times a year, though! I just checked my last receipt from them in my email inbox and I got it for $9.16 apiece, which is manageable for me.

What do you mean layering the FAB Ultra Repair Cream? Like, under makeup products? Or when you apply it on top of skincare it reacts or doesn't settle well? You did GOOD. Keep those tubs!

Thank you so much. It's really hard but I'm taking it one day at a time. :') [removed] Tbh sunscreen is probably the most expensive part of my routine; it's tough to find a good one that's under $3/oz (my max spf budget).

That's such a valid response and really you handled it so well.  I would be so confused and def have a good cry if I experienced so much hate at once like this.  It's like you just took a pop quiz on practicing objectivity in an emotionally draining environment and you totally aced it but it wasn't fun :p There was no ‚Äúholier than thou attitude.‚Äù OP was perfectly polite in all of her comments. Ok I totally understand why you feel that way from the title but seeing her replies makes me think that wasn‚Äôt op‚Äôs intent. Not tryna fight or anything bc when I saw the title I was kinda like yikes. But yeah I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal Thank you for the kind words. I appreciate you! Oh good to know, I saw it on amazon but all the recent reviews were people who said the formula had been changed and wasn‚Äôt as good anymore so I‚Äôll have to check out YesStyle! And kudos to you for being civil to everyone cause some of these people have been rude as hell for no reason lol.  good luck with your studies!! awesome!! thank you üòäI‚Äôm excited to try it Ah I see. The cold cream is everywhere where I live lol. Gotta give the balm a try. I don't know why are people taking personal offence to your comments when you're being nothing but nice on here, just because of some med student on some other post. I don't think you said it with an Ill intent or a holier-than-thou attitude and even if people misunderstood you, reading your other comments pretty much clears up that misunderstanding. I don't care if it's an unpopular opinion on here or if I get downvoted or whatever. You're most definitely not at fault here, and shouldn't be made to feel bad about it. WHO downvoted this??? This is a reasonable expression of hurt from the actions people in this sub have taken! like y‚Äôall hurt this person because of a title. please honestly leave the sub if you‚Äôre just here to bring other people down. I wish I could post that ‚Äújealousy is a disease, b*tch. get well soon‚Äù meme bc y‚Äôall really need to learn to control yourselves. has engaging w someone you disagree with via reddit or twitter or whatever ever actually gotten them to change their minds? you just look bitter and childish. learn to scroll on. I'm so sorry you had this experience. Even though they're written by strangers on the internet, random hateful comments can still hurt.

I'm also a PhD student, and I clicked on your post because probably like you, I have very little time or money to devote to skincare, I'm often sleep-deprived and stressed (which can affect my skin), and I value research-driven products. These are all very relevant to my skincare routine, and I think it was entirely reasonable for you to mention that you are a PhD student.

In general, r/SkincareAddiction is a huge and weird place. You might enjoy r/scacjdiscussion more! Great question. From my personal experience using the two products, yeah, they feel equally hydrating, and my face feels great after using either. And like I mentioned in my main description comment, I am all about that hydration right now! :) 

But getting into the more nitty gritty, The Buffet vs. Niacinamide + Zinc are two slightly different products. 

The Buffet is formulated to be more about anti-aging, and claims to include ingredients that they have found target various signs of aging. I don't know too much about the ingredients that the Buffet uses in their formulation and how efficacious they are. I've found it suitable for making my skin feel hydrated, and that's all I can claim so far. I haven't found it to be that incredibly effective in the "visible improvements" department as the Niacinamide + Zinc product has been.

Niacinamide itself is a molecule (Vitamin B3) that is more known to be reparative,  and what's known about it is that it's great for making the skin feel and look brighter, maintains the skin's barrier ability, and helps prevent dark spots through the suppression of pigment accumulation. Because it improves the skin's water retention, it's said to be hydrating. The Zinc is in there because zinc, in medical literature, is known to be anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. These are the quick reasons why I like the Niachinamide + Zinc product. I've noticed it's definitely helped my skin look and feel really soft and even in the past, when I used it regularly. Also because it's only around $5, which is great when you're on a grad student budget.

Hope this was helpful, I wrote it up really quickly, just referring to a couple literary sources I have saved on Niacinamide! I‚Äôll look too! You judge people solely based on their level of education? Yikes. That‚Äôs rude Hi there,

Weird how it was taken in such a negative light, didn't think that would be an issue at all. I guess you don't really know about subreddit nuances/attitudes until you post and see the response to things like this.

I just scrolled down and saw the med student shelfie! I would personally love to know that someone's a med student, it's a ton of work and a huge part of their lives as well! Hey, never claimed to be an expert in skincare! I'm on this journey just like all of you. 

If you wanted to talk about my research, that I probably know a lot more about than most people. :) $9 is good!! I paid a lot more because I think I wanted to try it out before committing to a new website and giving them all my info haha. But I might have to go for it.

Right now I'm really trying to minimise the number of products I use but I was finding that active/serum + FAB + sunscreen + makeup wasn't working well. It seemed like I couldn't get everything to absorb down and I was was getting some pilling. 

I love it as a body moisturiser though (with no product underneath). 

I'm currently trying TO's natural moisturising factors because it was super cheap to try..! Damn y‚Äôall got some real asshole passive aggressive comments today! This woman did and said nothing to deserve these responses. How about we not take insecurities out on [undeserving] others and perhaps pursue therapy to improve self-confidence, hmm?? Don‚Äôt diminish op‚Äôs education over fragranced sunscreen... Hi there,

Thank you! 

For more information, check out our [Rule Explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rule_overview#wiki_rule_1.3A_be_kind_and_respectful). Yeah, I am definitely keeping that in mind, thanks for the reminder! :)

As a Ph.D. student I actually have a lot of experience reading peer-reviewed scientific literature literally every day, so hopefully I can find out more about ingredients and things I am not super familiar with. I'm obviously not an expert at skincare, and never claimed to be! I'm definitely leaning on the side of being cautious so I probably won't full-on buy it unless I know more about it.

If you look at my shelfie you'd see that a lot of it definitely follows that criteria, I am not a "scents" lady at all. But as someone who enjoys experiencing new products, I'd still love to at least smell it! Thank you so much for your kind words and validation. Yeah, I definitely cried a bit. But I'm glad I was able to keep it together on the actual discussion thread. I won't be back after today. I'll just do my BiG-bRaIn sKiNcArE sCiEnTiFiC rEsEArCh on my own. :) Agree with Marislikeparis. Don‚Äôt let people get you down but i understand if you don‚Äôt feel welcome in this sub because really some mean people came out of the woodworks. Good luck in your grad program, i hope Covid isn‚Äôt ruining your grad plans too much! Thank you for the kind words. It's been an interesting day for sure. :/ Yeah, I imagine most of the snark (my own included) is extending from the med student post. He was pushing his ‚Äúevidence-based‚Äù routine, which rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. It was pretentious and holier-than-thou, when the majority of those here (outside of the mega shelfies) are trying to use evidence-based ingredients. I personally sub here as it‚Äôs basically the Wikipedia of skincare and there‚Äôs a lot of very good, scientifically-backed information.

So posting that you‚Äôre a Ph.D student gave the same impression as the cavalier med student. Your occupation/practice is irrelevant to your routine. If you‚Äôd posted a week ago, it likely would have been met with less hostility. Everyone‚Äôs job is a ton of work and a huge part of their lives. [removed] [removed] Hmm, that routine sounds great, but clearly if there's pilling it means some things aren't absorbing into the skin or are perhaps reacting with each other. I've experienced pilling just a handful of times in my life, but I'm not a super expert in pilling and why it happens. You're probably doing this already but I'd just switch out one product and see if it still happens?

Oh yeah, I've used TO's Natural Moisturizing Factors before, but unfortunately it was just once (like I used up one tube of it) and I didn't have any particular desire to repurchase it. I think I went back to using FAB Ultra Repair Cream because it was a bit heavier, which I liked. I'm quite a dry person. But, depending on your skin type and needs, the TO Moisturizer might be great. Even with me, I didn't have any issues with it whatsoever! It just wasn't as thick as I'd like. Aaahaha omg your big brain energy will be missed!  If you're ever in need of more secondhand sunscreen info, feel free to dm me ‚ô•Ô∏è r/asianbeauty is far less bitchy if you still want a skincare sub to peruse :) sorry everyone was so salty with you, it‚Äôs actually made me want to leave the sub out of embarrassment. I really feel like the replies to you tonight are indicative of the average person‚Äôs mindset and mental wellbeing on this sub, and it feels toxic. Hope you‚Äôre ok Thank you for your explanation. 

Yeah, I was a bit confused by what was "evidence", and he didn't seem to respond to a lot of the questions he was getting (I'm trying to do that in my thread as much as I can).

I can definitely see how people would think that mentioning my lifestyle/academic situation is not totally relevant to the face on my skin, which is what we're here to discuss. I didn't think that 3 letters could make people be this reactive and hateful, though, and that is something I will take into consideration moving forward. Did it actually give that impression or were people projecting? ü§î I‚Äôm going to go with the latter. It didn‚Äôt read that way; people ASSUMED that was OPs intention based on what someone else did. Perhaps the post could have elaborated more, but the bigger issue is the negative assumptions that were made in place of any facts.

On a side note, I find it ironic that there were so many negative comments in response to what ppl thought OP meant, which only clearly demonstrated they know diddly squat about the time commitment required for a PhD. ü§£ STAHP!!!! Pour a glass, puff or pop something and relax. Let‚Äôs not get all in our feelings on a skincare thread. It is so not that serious. üëÜüèªüëÜüèªüëÜüèª We are not a monolith. Not everyone in this subreddit works or if they do, works FT, has a demanding job, or a job that for one reason or another is a ‚Äúhuge part of their lives‚Äù. Not everyone lives in the USA or a country with such [poor work-life balance](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/what-work-life-balance-looks-like-around-the-world). These are [inaccurate] assumptions. I've had to remove your comment because it breaks Rule 1: Be kind and respectful.

Really interesting because I find the NMF a lot heavier than the FAB..! I enjoy conversations like this which remind me how differently we all experience the same things (: Thank you, I will keep that in mind!! :) exactly, maybe I don‚Äôt belong here... I feel like kindness isn‚Äôt that hard, and ignoring/ scrolling past/ not engaging is even less hard. like i said, i learned before kindergarten that if you can‚Äôt say something nice don‚Äôt say it at all, no phd required ü§ì How is the time commitment required for a PhD relative to either a skincare routine or a skincare subreddit? That‚Äôs why OP is getting downvoted, it‚Äôs not relevant. We all have our own busy lives, many with equally strenuous lifestyles. The vast majority of people in the world work very hard at something, whether outside the home or within.  I suppose there are women who sit around and drink all day while someone else takes care of their children, but they tend to be the exception rather than the rule. Don‚Äôt worry, the person who you‚Äôre responding to (comment now deleted) lied about being a 4th year dermatology resident in an AMA post. They‚Äôre not an expert either. What is your area of study? I know, I was reading through the replies to this post last night just thinking Jesus I would not hang out with these people irl. People were acting bitter and just lacking self awareness tbh. Really not very nice Some of us spend more than 30 mins on a nightly routine, waiting 10 mins between several products before applying the next layer. How much time one has is obviously directly related to their skincare routine and this thread. Hence the photo of a small number of products from someone who hasn‚Äôt got time to be experimenting like some of us.

The statement wasn‚Äôt a flex or meant to imply that no one else is busy so why the hate? No one downvotes posts when ppl make statements that apply to everyone in this subreddit  like how passionate they are about skincare or wanting to improve their skin. It was unnecessary and really reflects individual insecurities, but carry on with excuses for that behavior of you wish. So are you going to tell people off who post here looking advice because they are a "busy mom" showing off their skincare. Because the time commitment "isn't relevant"? Stress... obviously Backing up your use of generalizations with more generalizations further demonstrates the point is lost on you. Environmental Toxicology/Neuroscience! In particular, I'm studying air pollution from cars and how it can damage human health. Like I said in my original comment to OP, the hate is likely stemming from the med student post. If they‚Äôd posted a week ago I doubt anybody would have batted an eye to it. But hey that‚Äôs how reddit works - people vote how they want and can choose to like or dislike posts entirely based on their own opinions. This post did not seem to resonate with the community, so it is what it is. Dunno why you got downvoted because you‚Äôre right. If someone shared their routine as a busy mom nobody would have been salty. Everybody just got all ‚Äúoh so you think you‚Äôre better than me?!‚Äù for like no reason.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* The first picture shows my current skin care routine, the second picture shows a sample of products that made me itchy.

**Me:** 32F, Fitzpatrick type II.

**My skin:** Sensitive, on the dry side. Eczema, but mostly on my hands, sometimes my body. Mild acne, especially around my period. Goals are mostly healthy happy skin, but I'd also reduce some mild melasma/hyperpigmentation, prevent deepening of fine lines, and reduce acne.

**Current routine:**

AM

\- Splash with water

\- Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer

\- Blue Lizared Face Sunscreen

PM

\- Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water

\- Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser

\- TO Azelaic Acid (every other day)

\- Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer + 2-3 drops TO Rose Hip Seed Oil

&#x200B;

**Reviews:**

**Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water (pink cap):** I use this as a first cleanser in the evening to take off sunscreen and makeup if I wore some. Love it. It feels refreshing and cleans without any irritation.

**Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser:** It works and doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin, but sometimes I feel like it is still a little bit drying. I‚Äôll probably rebuy it anyway though.

**Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer:** My HG! I only started using it about a month ago, and my skin feels so much better already. Before it would often still feel dry and tight after moisturizing, but this moisturizer makes my skin feel nice and soft. I love the ingredients, they are simple but have everything you might ask for (squalane, hyaluronic acid, ceramides).

**Blue Lizard Face Sunscreen SPF 30:** Best face sunscreen I found so far, but I‚Äôm still looking for alternatives. It is a mixed (mineral and chemical) sunscreen. It has a very slight white cast that blends in nicely on my light skin. But something to be aware of if you‚Äôre darker. It goes on very nicely, but sometimes can make my skin feel slightly dry.

**Maelove Glow Maker:** The jury is still out on this one. I heard great things about it, but considering my sensitive skin I should probably have gone for a vitamin C derivative. It irritates my skin, but I‚Äôm hoping it can get used to it the way it got used to the Azelaic Acid (see below).

**TO Azelaic Acid:** Already reordered this. The first time I used it, it made me feel like I had a sunburn on my face the next day. After that I started buffering it (applying it on top of moisturizer) and only used it every three days at first. Now I‚Äôm able to use it every other day with only minor irritation. I feel like it has improved my skin texture a little bit so far and my face feels more smooth the day after I apply it. It‚Äôs too early to say if it will help with my melasma and mild acne.

**TO Rose Hip Seed Oil:** I mix 2-3 drops into my moisturizer at night. It makes my skin feel so soft, and I love the luxurious feeling of applying an oil on my face.

**Aquaphor:** HG! We have multiple tubs of this around the house and I keep another one at work. I mostly use this on my hands and lips, but occasionally dab a little bit on my face when it‚Äôs feeling especially dry. I haven‚Äôt needed to do this as much though since switching to the Vanicream moisturizer. I use the baby one because it was cheaper on Amazon, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a difference between the regular and the baby version.

**Second picture/rejects:**

**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream:** This cream gets a lot of love on here and my daughter‚Äôs pediatrician recommended it for her eczema. Unfortunately it makes me itchy.

**Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence:** Another product that gets a lot of love on here, but also made me very itchy the one time I applied it on my face. When I spot tested it on my arm or my neck I didn‚Äôt notice any irritation though, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allergic to snail mucin or my face is just sensitive to it.

**Clinique moisture surge overnight mask**: I got this as a free gift with purchase of a Clinique product (which I ended up returning). I used it twice, and the second time it made my face break out in red, itchy bumps.

**Clinique all about eyes:** It stings slightly when I apply it under my eye, and also made my entire face break out in red itchy bumps after a couple of uses. Ironically, this is what got me more into skincare though, because I liked the feeling of taking care of my skin and it felt kind of luxurious to apply something other than just moisturizer. Just got that vanicream daily moisturizer couple weeks ago and man it‚Äôs amazing. I also didn't see any improvements using the Snail Mucing, despite the glowing reviews. It even made me break out a little bit. Welp looks like i wont be getting the snail one then.
Everything reacts to my face I use to use the garnier as a first cleanser but just switched to using fragrance free ponds make up remover, it makes my skin very soft and feeling more hydrated as a first cleanser. I have acne prone and sensitive skin and as long as it's the fragrance free one, I haven't had any irritation or breakouts. is there a difference between the cerave moisturizing cream no pump vs pump? Hello has anyone broken out from vanicream daily moisturizer ? I hear squalane in it is making people breakout Is the blue lizard sunscreen better than the Cerave one? The Cerave one sucks so much That Garnier is actually a really subpar product, but if you like it then you'll probably be amazed by some of the Korean or French micellar waters! I didn't realize it was leaving a film on my face until I tried others. But if you are just using it for a first cleanse, then maybe that doesn't matter. how does the vanicream facial moisturizer compare to the vanicream lite lotion? i adore the lotion (using rn) and am starting to like vanicream a lot more than cerave Vanicream over CeraVe FTW! So much more soothing and gentle. I love the Daily Facial Moisturizer, I also add the regular lotion on top at night. how long did u use it for? I've been using for a couple weeks and I can't tell if I have any improvement yet I think it‚Äôs the same, it seems like the 16 oz size has a pump, the 12 oz size doesn‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt tried the Cerave one due to my reaction to the Cerave moisturizing cream, but I think the Blue Lizard one is definitely worth a try. It sucks less than any of the other sunscreens I tried. I‚Äôve never tried the lite lotion, just the moisturizing cream, so I can‚Äôt do a direct comparison. I like the moisturizing cream for my body, but prefer the facial moisturizer for my face. It feels more moisturizing but at the same time less thick. Looking at the ingredients, the daily facial moisturizer has some more hydrating and skin barrier strengthening ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides), but of course what works for your skin can be very individual. The Daily Lotion absorbs more quickly and is a tad lighter/watery. Sometimes the Lotion doesn't always absorb for me if I use too much, but I don't have that experience with the Daily Lotion. I combine them in the PM. Good to know!! **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I'm a broke college student with ADHD, and this is my first attempt at a complete skincare routine. The most I've ever been able to keep up with before is moisturizer once a month bc I just couldn't bother, but I found this sub, Hyram's youtube channel, And Liah Yoo's channel last month. So now here we are. 

Skin type: I have dry to normal skin, but as I've gotten older I've noticed my chin is full of whiteheads/sebum fillaments every so often. I also have KP on my legs and arms(trying to exfoliate more often). The whiteheads/sebum fillaments calm down once in a while but it's never completely gone. My nose also gets sebum filaments on the sides, and a blackhead here and there on the top every once in a while. Currently I have a small pimple on my forehead that's driving me nuts, but I'm doing my best to take care of it. 

Products:

‚Ä¢Clinique face wash for combination skin: I hate this thing idk why. My mom bought it on a trip we went on half a year ago bc she forgot her cleanser at home and just didn't use it when we got back. I can't afford to spend more than $10 on a cleanser so I'm just using it till it runs out. It's not overly stripping or do anything bad, but it does leave my skin a bit dry. I guess it's just missing an oomph.

‚Ä¢cetaphill moisturizer for dry skin: This was also something my mom had lying around. She's buys these from. Costco and had more than half the container left so she let me have some. I love this thing.

‚Ä¢Burn out sunscreen: this came in this week. I have a lighter skin tone and I barely notice it. It doesnt feel greasey or bother me at all. I never really go outside though so idrk how to tell if it's doing anything. 

Last but not least

‚Ä¢aquaphor: This came in just today, but I had a super small tube of it a year ago and I loved it. After stalking this sub I caved and ordered it. 

I've only had this routine for about 3days, but I feel the start of a new beginning that includes healthy habits. I'd love to try products from The Ordinary, I'm eyeing niacinamide as a treatment. But I'm just taking it slow.

Routine:

‚Ä¢cleanse with dry skin, rinse with warm water(PM sometimes AM)

‚Ä¢moisturize (AM and PM)

‚Ä¢sunscreen (AM only) 

‚Ä¢aquaphor (for both AM and PM bc it's colder now) Heads up - all November the ordinary is 23% off Good on you for starting a skin care routine üòä. Simple Micellar face wash is cheaper than Clinque, so look for that when next time you shop for a cleanser this is a good routine!!! i would really recommend using cerave instead of cetaphil though because cetaphil is really just fragrance and doesn‚Äôt have any helpful ingredients- but if it works for you then that‚Äôs great!!!

I started using a lot of cerave products in my routine because of how gentle everything is and i really trust the ingredients! i would recommend using their foaming cleanser, their AM or PM moisturizer, and even their healing balm :) but again if this routine helps you the best then please keep doing it!!! Don't ever break yourself again. This is the best time to live your life, otherwise you will regret later. Telling you from my experience This is a good start, OP. Better late than never :)) Is it just zinc oxide? And what does it promise by eco? I recommend La Roche Posay Gel cleanser. Its nice, I kind of almost prefer it over cerave‚Äôs gel cleanser when it comes down to feel. I saw that post earlier today, thanks for the reminder! I'm not ready to buy anything yet. As I still have much more to finish. Hey! I'm from India and only select websites ship TO's stuff here. Can you tell me from where can I get 23% off? I checked cult beauty but there was no discount. Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. My mom got this cleanser on a trip and never used it so I'm just finishing it up for her since I didn't want to spend money on a new one. I can't control the economy friend. Being broke isn't my choice. I'm glad everything looks alright. 

If you have any insight on if sunscreen actually does anything for homebody's like me who are inside 90% of the time. I'd love to hear it, I haven't been able to find much other than it cans maybe? Protect you from the lights that electronics give off. Their website says no chemical actives, paraben-free, petroleum free, fragrance free, eco sensitive, ocean safe, biodegradable.

Zinc oxide (non-nano) 18.8%

It was the first sunscreen Hyram recommended from his drugstore sunscreen video. I have been eyeing it but I ended up ordering a mini ssize paula's choice cleanser for $4. Since I can't afford to guess and see what works and what doesnt rn. On their actual website Check deciem I'm pretty new to skincare as well but from what I've heard, you should apply sunscreen at least once in your AM routine even if you're at home all day. The UVA and UVB rays can penetrate through windows. Idk about the lights from electronics tho. I also barely leave my house anymore but I apply sunscreen in the morning and then wash it off with a double cleanse at night. Hope it helped :) 18.8% sounds amazing Thanks for the info! The bottle instructions say every 2hrs I'm not sure if that's a bit too excessive though. That's for when you're outside and directly under sunrays. That definitely makes much more sense. **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

PC BHAüí™ Some hopefully helpful info about the routine: my skin type is *very* oily and somewhat acne prone I‚Äôm a guy  in my early-mid twenties. 

Was looking for a routine that would help
me control sebum and not look like I‚Äôm a 24 hour oil factory (which caused me to breakout often). Also to help in a few other issues like blackheads and hyperpigmentation. After days of researching ingredients and products here is where I currently am in my skincare routine: 

My AM routine:

1) CeraVe foaming facial cleanser *oil control*
2) The Ordinary Niacinamide serum *hyperpigmentation*
3) The Ordinary Caffeine eye serum *dark circle*
4)  Versed dew point gel-cream *hydration*
5) Purito centella spf 50+ *sunscreen*
6) Vanicream spf30 lip balm *dry lips/sunscreen*

PM Routine:

1) CeraVe foaming facial Cleanser *oil control*
2) Paulas Choice 2% BHA *exfoliation* OR Inkey List Retinol serum *everything lol* (alternating days with one break day in between)
3) The Ordinary caffeine eye serum *dark circles*
4) CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion *heavier hydration*
5) Vaseline on certain dry spots, sometimes lips *skin protectant*

I should mention I don‚Äôt use the CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser because it did nothing for my oily skin and felt heavy after using it

Some of my favorite products and reviews: 

CeraVe foaming facial cleanser: perfect for me! Cleans without that dry feeling afterward and it really does control oil production long after I use it. I‚Äôll probably keep buying more of this when it runs out (although I do want to try that matcha hemp cleanser from krave eventually)

Paulas Choice 2% BHA: I feel like this sub needs no introduction to this product lol. It works great, skin looks nice and bright the next morning and it was very gentle with zero irritation the first time I used it. I bought the sample size first, used it a few times and had to go out and get the full size one immediately. Big fan of this one especially for my oily skin.

TO Niacinimide: originally got this for the oil control and it does do that, but I also noticed my skin is brighter and more even! I use it more so now for hyperpigmentation and for the great brightness it gives my skin. Already ordered 2 more of these!

Versed Dew-point Moisturizing gel cream: Squalene based moisturizer, perfect for using it at day time because my skin just drinks this up immediately and doesn‚Äôt just sit in my face. Plus it‚Äôs got green tea to reduce pore size. Definitely a great product for any skin type but mostly oily skin for its quick absorption. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm still new to the skincare world so any and all feedback would be appreciated! 

Happy holidays everyone! Hey! It's great that you want to share your Shelfie with the SkincareAddiction community!

However, I'm afraid I've had to remove your post for now because it doesn't abide by our [post requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/postrequirements).

The users of this sub would like to know more about the products in your image and how you're using them. That's why we ask everyone who posts a Shelfie to include the following information in the comments:


- Your skin type & skin concerns

- Full list of products pictured and your AM & PM routine

- Reviews! Either:

   - Short mini reviews for each of your products (e.g. "Smells like pepperoni pizza and feels like jello but man it really helped with my burgeoning devil horns!") ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/f0x0x6/shelfie_recently_overhauled_my_skincare_routine/fgzfd9n/))

   - or longer in-depth reviews for your top 3, which should at least cover: the packaging, product feel & smell, what are the positive & negative effects, does it do what it should/what you bought it for, and overall opinion ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/erxdy6/shelfie_inspired_by_the_antihaul_got_my_routine/ff6i7ux/))

I'm particularly interested in the Versed Dew Point moisturizer & Vanicream Lip Protectant!

Let me know when you‚Äôve added that info so I can approve this post, or you can make a new post with the required info! Whatever works :) Hi, just out of curiosity, does the travel size of the Paula's Choice BHA have a glossy finish? 
I've seen quite a few people sharing their shelfies and the ones who have it, in their pictures it always looks glossy to me, just like yours does. 
I'm asking you this because I bought mine in January on Lookfantastic and mine definitely has a matte finish üòÆ How is the inkey list retinol? I‚Äôve been wanting to try it but am nervous to try an inexpensive retinol Good job on actually sticking to the routine! Have you seen any improvements so far? I remember being in the same boat as you a few years ago and the jump from bar soap to simple cleansing/moisturizing did so much for me.

Also, how's the TO caffeine solution? I've been eyeing it but I've read conflicting reviews. I love CeraVe products! Always delivering on what they promise! Vaseline, my ride or die I was just about to ask this! I bought the versed eye cream for lines and wrinkles and I love it. I‚Äôm interested in their other products. It‚Äôs my favorite moisturizer I‚Äôve ever tried (which admittedly isn‚Äôt t too many lol). It‚Äôs not completely a gel consistency, it‚Äôs more like a water cream. Goes into the skin super fast and I personally use it at day time for that reason. You don‚Äôt need to use too much because it glides beautifully across your skin with minimal rubbing. I‚Äôm using a lot of products now but I feel like this one definitely adds a bit of brightness to my skin. I would definitely give it a shot, I‚Äôm already on my second one! Done! It was alot to type and I really took my time with it lol :) Btw the Versed dew point gel cream is my favorite moisturizer I‚Äôve ever tried and in my opinion beats it‚Äôs Korean counterpart (iunik centella gel cream). It goes into the skin really fast and doesn‚Äôt feel like anything is on the face. The green tea in it is a huge bonus for oily pores!

The vanicream lip balm is good but does leave a bit of white cast on the lips. It does make my dry lips go away though and no weird flavor or scent so it‚Äôs a winner in my book! PC went through a change, it states it on their website! :) Yea mine does, I got my travel size one from th Nordstrom store and from what I saw all of them were glossy there. The full size bottle I ordered from the Paulas Choice website has the matte finish. 

Haven‚Äôt noticed that some of the travel sizes were glossy and some matte. That‚Äôs interesting. Definitely, my skin looks and feels way better now! I‚Äôve seen some good results from the eye serum in my dark circles but it‚Äôs nothing mind blowing. 

I do like the warm tingle it gives around the eye though and definitely helps me feel ‚Äúawake‚Äù around that area. I‚Äôd say give it a shot especially for the low price point but keep your expectations realistic because it won‚Äôt ‚Äúdo‚Äù too much IMO. Thank you so much! Approved~

The Versed gel cream sounds awesome! I have dry skin but use gel creams for layering, I'll have to check it out :D Thank you! So does that mean that my bottle is the older or the updated version? I assume it's the older since everyone else here seems to own the glossy version. I was aware that the full size bottle had a matte finish, so that's why I thought mine was normal to be also matte. 
Just another question, when you bought yours, did it come sealed? Mine didn't and I thought it was little weird because that gives me the uncertainty of it being already open or not. It did come with a rubber/silicone lid inside the plastic white lid, I guess to avoid any spillage. **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Male, 35 year old, regular skin.

This routine is targeting general skin health and anti aging.

AM

* Elemis Dynamic Resurfacing Face wash
* Elemis Time Defence Eye Reviver
* Perricone MD Face Finishing & Firming Moisturizer (SPF 30)

PM

* Elemis Dynamic Resurfacing Face wash
* Neutrogena Hydro Boost / Elemis Energising Skin Scrub (Twice a week)
* Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Serum (3 times a week)
* L'oreal Age Specialist Night Cream

Products Overview

**Elemis Dynamic Resurfacing Face Wash**

Been using it for about 1 month, skin feels really smooth and revived after AM and PM wash, has a fresh scent. Overall a great face wash.

**Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment Serum**

Bought this after reading a lot of recommendations on the brand here and in Amazon, great serum! Contains Peptides and Vit C, I usually use it only in my PM routine before going to bed. Has a rich creamy texture, one pump is enough to cover the entire face. Priced a little high, but as I understood this is the strongest consumer grade Retinol you can buy. Have only been using it for 2 weeks but so far happy with it.

**Elemis Energizing Screen Scrub**

Wonderful, gentle scrub by Elemis, I use it 1-2 times a week combined with the face wash, leaves skin unbelievably soft and smooth, doesn't cause irritation or redness. Highly recommended.

**Elemis Time Defence Eye Reviver**

Love this eye cream, I tend to have dark circles below the eyes, especially in the AM. Half a pump of this cream does the trick. My eyes immediately feel more refreshed and hydrated. Has a slight tingling sensation when applied every time, I can really feel it working. Had a lot of great reviews on Amazon, decided to purchase albeit the high price ($66), but I think I found my new fav eye cream.

**Perricone MD High Potency Classics Face Finishing & Firming Tinted Moisturizer (SPF 30)**

My first Perricone MD product, and I love it! The texture of this cream is amazing and it has a fresh aromatic scent which just feels great on the skin. Contains ALA, Canedia Tree Extract, Mineral based SPF and Titanium Dioxide 4.2%.

**L'oreal Age Specialist Night Cream**

Not much to say about this, got it as a gift, pretty good night cream overall, said to target anti aging.

**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Exfoliator**

Exfoliator from the Hydro Boost line, I use it every now and then when I need a stronger scrub. Contains Hyaluronic Acid as the main active ingredient, pretty much raved about everywhere, good stuff.

**Bior√© UV Aqua Rich SPF 50**

This one needs to further introduction :) Great lineup! I have never tried any Perricone products, but the tinted moisturizer sounds really nice. Can you elaborate on the color of the tint‚Äî is there just one or maybe two general colors? Is it fuller or lesser coverage? Thank you! Sitting in the Derm rn  hoping to get a prescription. Wish me luck! Tretinoin on a 16 year old? You'll never look your age in time. Not related but what do you think of the klairs vitamin e mask? Kinda an unrelated question so I‚Äôm sorry, but what are the differences between Retin-A and Trtinoin. I don‚Äôt really understand because I‚Äôm only 13 :( 16 years old , class of 2020 yay . I got into skincare my freshman year I believe at 13 turning 14 . I was pretty uneducated and used whatever products , I began with random products from my local pharmacies . I then began maturing and began googling a bunch of things , turns out I have really oily skin ( T-Zone) But overall my face is oily . My biggest concern is recently I‚Äôve gotten cheek breakouts that i have never had before my skin has been ( almost ) clear overall but I‚Äôve dealt with small colorless bumps all over my forehead ( clogged pores now that I visited a dermatologist) . My skin goals are to clear my face up more ( cheeks & forehead ) and brighten my skin, also control the amount of oiliness on my face . 

[AM Routine ] 

Cosrx Low Ph Morning Cleanser - Great for the morning it feels refreshing especially when I would have to wake up early for school 

Klairs Supple Preparation Toner - I used it a while back and loved it  but ran out and finally repurchased a few days ago . My face feels super clean after swiping it ( I use a cotton pad ) . 

Milk Cooling Stick - Honestly bought it for the hype , I think it pretty much does nothing but it is cooling so I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs good for when I go back to school and go back to feeling half dead in the morning . I apply it under my eyes and places where I usually go red . 

Klairs Vitamin E Mask - I just recently got it ( all klairs products I bought a few days ago from wishtrend‚Äôs brightening package , a great deal If you love Klairs but shipping was horrible for me lol ) 

Klairs Vitamin C - I used it a while ago and I must say this is my holly grail !! I ran out as well but repurchased it‚Äôs AMAZING for brightening your complexion especially during the winter when my skin is dull and is especially great for acne scars / dark spots , I‚Äôve recommended this to so many of my friends . Also now that I have the vitamin E Mask I mix both of them and apply them . 

Neutrogena oil free moisturizer with spf 35- its great , not amazing I‚Äôm still on the search for my go to moisturizer and sunscreen , it is hydrating and good for my skin type . 

Biore UV sunscreen - I mentioned that I began breaking out on my cheeks which led me to go to a dermatologist recently . Im not sure if it was this product that made me break out . Summer had just started and I began using this sunscreen and boom break outs began but I also began using Cosrx‚Äôs BHA/AHA Toner ( review below ) 

[PM Routine ] 

Banana Co Clean it Zero - I‚Äôm from New York and I live really close to an Asian community ( not Asian myself ) so I have access to a lot of Korean products . This is really good for removing makeup , I don‚Äôt wear a lot so I‚Äôm not sure for people who wear full faces . But it certainly does the job for me (: 

Neogen Green Tea Foam Cleanser - THIS IS MY SECOND HOLY GRAIL !!! I love love love it ! Super refreshing I‚Äôve repurchased twice  and will probably repurchase again soon )):  it doesn‚Äôt dry out my super oily skin at night and my skin feels so alive and fresh

Klairs Supple Preparation Toner ( review above ) 

Klairs Gentle Black sugar polish - very gentle as stated in the name , it‚Äôs pretty good so far I used it 3 times a week with days in between . It‚Äôs very soft and isn‚Äôt harsh on my skin so it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ripping my flesh off while exfoliating. 

Curology - My prescription is 4% Azelaic Acid 1% Clindamycin 0.25% Zinc Pyrithione . I‚Äôve been using this for less than 20 days so I can‚Äôt say much but now that I got tretinoin I will not continue it . 

[ Unused Items ] 

Cosrx AHA Whitehead Power Liquid - used it for only a while but I‚Äôm impatient and probably didn‚Äôt give it enough time to work on my skin so I noticed no changes 

Neogen Real Ferment Micro Essence- bought during Sokoglam‚Äôs Black Friday sale ( its a bit pricey ) my friend recommended it to me and it‚Äôs ok I don‚Äôt really notice anything from using it but she assures it brightens up her skin a lot . 

Stridex Red Pad - I heard a lot of reviews on this and decided to try but same as the Whitehead Power Liquid I did not give it enough time so saw no changes . 

A‚ÄôPeu Glycolic Acid Cream - purchased a while back but have noticed no changes . Not really sure what to say on this item it‚Äôs just sitting on my shelf doing nothing 

SkinFood Rice Mask Wash Off - it‚Äôs a good exfoliator it‚Äôs also very gentle and softer than the one from Klairs . I kind of just stopped using it not sure why .

[ New Items ] 

Tretinoin Cream 0.025% - Super excited for the changes but not the break outs )): I finally went to my dermatologist after dealing with my cheek acne and bumps all over my forehead 

Neutrogena Hydro Boost - my dermatologist gave this to me as a gift and says she loves it and recommends it especially now that I will be beginning tretinoin ^ 

Klairs Foam Cleanser - still new / unopened I bought it to prepare and use with my new tretinoin Cream I hope it‚Äôs as refreshing as Neogen‚Äòs


In conclusion I‚Äôd like to thank my parents especially mom for supporting my skincare addiction lol just kidding thank you mom for buying me many of these products <3 I have also saved up my coins and bought some for myself . Question - do u like the klairs foaming face wash or do u think its just genaric Good Luck!!! I missed my appointment once before getting my prescription , it was a hassle üò™ ? It‚Äôs good so far . I actually just got it , I just commented my review . I mix it with the vitamin c also from Klairs and apply it together . I‚Äôm hopping it brightens my skin more :D Retain-A is one brand name for tretinoin. Tretinoin is the name of the actual medication, but you can buy many different brands and generic versions. [deleted] Sorryyy it‚Äôs still unopened / new !! I just bought a bunch of Klairs products . I can‚Äôt say much but I‚Äôll hopefully make a review when I begin using it !! Tretinoin is a retinoid and they are the gold standard for collagen synthesis and anti-aging. Tretinoin is also  pure retinoic acid, not a derivative like retinol or retinoid-like compound such as Myristoyl Nonapeptide-3. Most 16 year olds don't need or think of using something strong like Tretinoin, so getting that far of a head start means you're never gonna look your age if you can keep with it. Yes I did and I‚Äôm basically cutting off most of my products ( especially at night ) I‚Äôll just be using my cleanser , toner , moisturizer ( Neutrogena ) waiting for it to dry 15 min and applying the tretinoin It‚Äôs also one of the most commonly used acne medications so if I had to throw out a wild crazy guess.. that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre using it for. Uhhh yes it is used for anti aging, but I don't think it will stop time and make this person forever 16... I was prescribed tretinoin when I was about 12 for acne purposes. Yes, it's the gold standard for anti-aging, but it has other uses. Interesting, is it ok for us so young starting with retinol, though it was for late 20s. Would be interested in using if so. try something without spf for nighttime! you won‚Äôt need it :) I got prescribed it in my mid-teens for acne Correct I'm aware of that lol There's no problem with doing it. I meant the Neutrogena hydro boost gel cream lol my bad the other Neutrogena is for day time of course ! Thanks for the tip though (: Yep it‚Äôs exactly what I use it for oops my bad! good luck it‚Äôs well worth it! **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* This looks dreamy!! Haha, I also use the chocolate frog tin for storage! So compact and organized!!!! I have the yellow/beige container size on my desk with my daily skincare and makeup then 2 drawers full and the bathroom shelf I have almost finalized my skincare routine. I'm currently in South Korea and when I return to the States next Jan (fingers crossed for my life) I'm going to get Glow Recipe's Watermelon Mist and Moisturizer (former for everyday, latter for AM) and Sol De Janeiro's Bum Bum cream for my body.

AM routine

1. Cosrx good morning cleanser
   1. Gentle cleanser. Helps prep for morning. 
2. Paula's Choice BHA 2% exfoliant
   1. I don't have large pores but the triangular area under my eyes are more "visible" and this really helped minimize them and helped my skin texture overall. Holy Grail.
3. Cosrx Cica Toner (mist and pat)
   1. Okay. I got it in the heat of the moment so not really passionate about it.
4. Skin1004 madagascar centella ampoule
   1. Literally got this last night and have only used twice but think it's helping to calm my skin which have gone through a lot recently since  I just completely changed my routine few weeks ago. 
5. IUNIK Tea Tree Serum
   1. Helps with my acne. I got this in order to get rid of Lush's tea tree toner which is full of essential oils. 
6. Paula's Choice ultra light antioxidant serum
   1. Okay. I got this as I was getting BHA exfoliant just cause and I think it's helping to brighten my skin but would like to get a serum dedicated to vitamin C since many of my products contain antioxidants. 
7. Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap (mix with Paula's Choice niacinamide booster)
   1. I really like this. It contains birch sap which is basically salicylic acid and contains snail mucin and it seems to help soothe and lock in products into my skin and leaves my skin feeling and looking plump. Although I want to get Glow Recipe's watermelon moisturizer for the morning and will probably use this only at night. It also smells like "healthy natural cola" if that makes any sense which I believe is from the birch sap since this is fragrance free.
8. Lush's Grease Lightning
   1. My hoil grail acne spot treatment or all over serum. This helps to kill most of my big pimples and reduce my acne.
9. Innisfree non nano sunscreen
   1. non-comedogenic sunscreen that's doesn't completely mattify my skin. It does leave a whitecast or "tone up" as most Korean sunscreens do but fades in a while and leaves my face just a tad glowy. 

PM routine

1. Shu Uemura porfinist 2 Cleansing Oil
   1. Very light consistency and haven't used it for a while to make any concrete judgment but takes off my makeup well, albeit I only wear skin tint so can't tell whether it helps with heavy makeup. Doesn't leave my skin oily after rinsing. 
2. Cosrx salicylic acid cleanser
   1. Stronger cleanser I use at night and loving it. It really helps get everything off and helps prep my skin. 
3. Paula's choice BHA 2% exfoliant
4. Cosrx Cica Toner (mist and pat)
5. Skin 1004 madagascar centella ampoule
6. IUNIK Tea Tree Serum
7. The Ordinary 10% niacinamide + 1% zinc solution
8. Cosrx  Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap + niacinamide booster
9. Lush Grease Lightning
10. Laneige Lip Mask in Mint Chocolate
   1. Love it. It leaves my lips very plump and hydrated in the morning and smells amazing. 

I use Lush's Tea Tree Water Cosrx's Low pH Barrier Mist and Cica Toner throughout the day depending on my skin condition but will get rid of the Tea Tree Water to replace with Glow Recipe's Watermelon mist. Also am thinking of getting powder sunscreen to use throughout the day.

P.S. Can anyone recommend me a good vitamin C serum for oily acne prone skin? I'm thinking of getting Klair's vitamin C Serum but it has mixed reviews. What products are in here? How do you like the PC niacinamide booster vs The Ordinary niacinamide? Thnx. When I move back to States I hope to make it more "spa like" if I can. Fingers crossed XD Hey! You have pretty much all the [required Shelfie info](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/postrequirements) except for reviews. 

Can you add either:

- Short mini reviews for each of your products (e.g. "Smells like pepperoni pizza and feels like jello but man it really helped with my burgeoning devil horns!") ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/f0x0x6/shelfie_recently_overhauled_my_skincare_routine/fgzfd9n/))

- or longer in-depth reviews for your top 3, which should at least cover: the packaging, product feel & smell, what are the positive & negative effects, does it do what it should/what you bought it for, and overall opinion ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/erxdy6/shelfie_inspired_by_the_antihaul_got_my_routine/ff6i7ux/))

Let know when you‚Äôve added that info :)

Also, I really liked NuFountain's vit c serum!! It's super lightweight and thin, dries fast, and has no shine. Might be good for oily skin! Sorry, it took a little while but I just uploaded the product list. I feel like the Paula‚Äôs choice has more oomph but considering the price, The Ordinary is more worth it. I've added the infos. Thank you for the recommendation. Awesome, thank you so much!! **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.*  Hi all! I just wanted to share my fall/winter skincare routine, which is simple enough to my taste and helps to keep my skin under control. 

**About me:**¬†26f, combo skin with first fine lines, mild rosacea, occasional closed comedones. My cheeks are usually dry and irritated and my forehead is always oily. Most of the products simply don‚Äôt sink into my skin and sit on top, forming a very nasty film (that‚Äôs why I ditched all Niacinamide serums).

The routine order is the following:

**AM**:

* Splash with water
* Geek & Gorgeous C-Glow
* Clinique Moisture Surge 72-hour Auto-replenishing Hydrator 
* La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Fluid SPF50+ PA++++

**PM:**

* Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm
* *every other day:*
   * Geek & Gorgeous Cheer Up  
   * Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask

*or*  
  

* Geek & Gorgeous A-Game 5
* Clinique Redness Solutions Daily Relief Cream  

**Reviews:**

**Geek & Gorgeous C-Glow - 10.50‚Ç¨/30ml.**¬†My fourth bottle of this serum. Simply the best LAA-based serum that I‚Äôve tried. Pleasant texture, great results. The famous combination of Vitamin C + Vitamin E + Ferulic Acid.

**Geek & Gorgeous Cheer Up - 28.00‚Ç¨/100ml.**¬†My second bottle of this exfoliant. Literally, the only thing that helps to combat whiteheads for me. 5% Mandelic + 1% Salicylic Acid. Not as irritating as other stuff with salicylic acid that I‚Äôve tried so far.

**Geek & Gorgeous A-Game 5 - 12.50‚Ç¨/28ml.** Recently decided to finally try a retinoid-based product. This one contains retinal - a middle ground between retinol and tretinoin. So far I‚Äôm quite pleased. It is not irritating, absorbs nicely, and seems to make my skin smoother. As for the anti-aging effect I have to wait another couple of month or maybe to age a bit more :) 

**La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Fluid SPF50+ PA++++ - 15.17‚Ç¨/50ml.** After trying countless sunscreens I always come back to this one. Light, transparent, can be reapplied without a mirror, doesn‚Äôt irritate my eyes. If only it didn‚Äôt contain alcohol! But for me, it is the best sunscreen on market right now in terms of comfort/protection ratio.

**Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm - 19.37‚Ç¨/125ml.** My holy grail make-up remover/cleansing balm. Per the aesthetician's advice I ditched micellar water because it irritates my skin so now I‚Äôm in an oil-based cleansers team. It removes even waterproof make-up and sunscreen, doesn‚Äôt contain any fragrance, and lasts forever.

**Clinique Moisture Surge 72-hour Auto-replenishing Hydrator - 25.45‚Ç¨/50ml.** Plain moisturizer. Absorbs nicely, thanks for that! I bought it on sale and so far satisfied with the jelly texture, but will not repurchase. 

**Clinique Redness Solutions Daily Relief Cream - 46.50‚Ç¨/50ml.** Also got it on sale, hoping to calm down my redness. It helps a bit, but not as much to justify its price point. The texture is nice and creamy.

**Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask- 37‚Ç¨/100ml.** More like a thick cream. I use it after the exfoliator to soften the skin. So far, the only mask which doesn't clog my pores. It is indeed moisturizing and I'm planning to use it also as an under-eye cream when it will get colder.

So that‚Äôs all! Hope you‚Äôll find some interesting products in my routine. Also, I am looking for advice regarding moisturizer (not Cerave or Cetaphil), which costs slightly less than unicorn tears, has a fast-absorbing texture, and provides a prolonged hydrating effect. I love the G&G vitamin C! Currently using Mad Hippie because I just wanted to try it and could get it for free, but I‚Äôll go back to G&G after it‚Äôs finished. 

Also tried the Cheer Up but it was too irritating for me. I use tretinoin and my skin doesn‚Äôt like BHA anymore, even if just once a week and in small percentages. Thanks for the reviews, I love G&G products as well! We have basically the same skin type, how come niacinamide is the only thing you ditched because of the film, does moisturiser not do the same? Following for moisturizer recs! Thank you for your detailed post! Hi! How long does Clinique Cleansing Balm last you? How is Mad Hippie Vit C? I always wanted to try it, maybe because of the nice bottle :) I don't know, maybe it's the formulation of Niacinamide serums. I tried G&G B-Bomb and The Ordinary. They both feel like they never absorb and remain sticky, even when I apply moisturizer or anything else on top. Hi! Around three months of daily usage, but sometimes I use it twice a day when I go to the gym. It‚Äôs a bit thicker, which makes it a bit hydrating. But I feel it‚Äôs less potent. That vitamin C is known for being less potent, but I just didn‚Äôt think it would actually make a difference. It‚Äôs subtle but my hyperpigmentation increased a bit, which I can even see on selfies. I wanted to try it because it‚Äôs supposed to be great for (fungal) acne but it didn‚Äôt make a difference for that either. 

With the G&G my hyperpigmentation didn‚Äôt decrease a lot, but it definitely didn‚Äôt increase either. For some people they have to dampen their skin before applying TO Niacinamide to make it absorb better Glossier Super Pure! Wow okay thats a long time, thank you! **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* [deleted] [deleted] I understand doing this for a product that comes in a jar, but why use all that extra plastic with products that already come in a pump or squeeze form? People needs to chill. I did exactly the same when I went travelling the other day, albeit in little less fancy containers.
Please can we keep the hostility away and keep this place supportive as it has always been otherwise it‚Äôs gonna end up as over at r/makeupaddiction. I don't understand all of these "wasteful" comments. What do you do when you travel? Purchasing travel size products are usually more expensive and will actually contribute to more plastic overall bc these bottles seems refillable infinitely for future traveling. I travel often have a set of small plastic bottles so I can fly with them that I put my skincare into - keeps me from buying travel size plastics every time I need to travel. If you are going to comment/downvote please advise on an alternative. [deleted] My skin is normal to dry with the occasional pimple. I wear very minimal makeup and I just turned 30 so I‚Äôm always seeking hydration and glowy skin. Some of these products I love and would repurchase and some are working for now. I‚Äôm also still looking for a retinoid product to introduce to my routine.

Edit to add: I decanted my products into airless pump bottles I got on Amazon after being inspired by another post I saw on here. It reduces the space it takes up on my counter and makes it easy to travel with my products. It‚Äôs cumbersome to do this and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs truly worth it, but it sure looks nice!

**AM:**

* **Sunday Riley CEO** - this is my first bottle of this particular vitamin C after using the Ole Henriksen Truth Serum for a long time.  I do like this product although it is a thin, white creamy product and I did prefer the serum formula of the Truth Serum. I like that this doesn‚Äôt have any synthetic colorings though.

* **Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion** - great stuff. Almost leans towards a gel cream rather than a thick lotion. Great ingredients, no fragrance and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and not heavy.

* **Coola Mineral Sun Silk Creme SPF 30** - this is my 3rd bottle of this stuff. I love that it is very thin and light. It leaves a white cast initially and fades after about 5 min. Looks totally fine under makeup and doesn‚Äôt clog my pores or anything. I am looking for something different and less expensive with maybe higher SPF when this runs out.

**PM:**

* **Physician‚Äôs Formula Perfect Matcha Cleansing Balm** - I‚Äôm very new to the double cleanse after using Purity by Philosophy for about 15 years. Like I said, I wear very little makeup so I target this to remove my eye makeup. It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm not blown away and don‚Äôt really love the balm cleanse so I might not repurchase this. It contains fragrance but to me it is a very light and pleasing scent.

* **Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser** - really like this product. Again, great ingredients, no fragrance, simple. It just works and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and not stripped.

* **REN Ready Set Glow AHA Tonic** - I‚Äôm really liking this product. I‚Äôve used acids in the past and I feel like this really works. My skin feels super clear and my normal blackhead areas seem reduced. I don‚Äôt bother with cotton pads or whatever, I just put some in my palms and press it in like an essence. Smells citric and a little chemically but it disappears quickly. I definitely noticed some tingling/burning for the first few uses so I introduced it slowly.

* **Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion** - this is ‚Äúultra light‚Äù so I think I‚Äôd prefer a heavier nighttime moisturizer for my skin, but this very nice, light and moisturizing. No complaints. Love it. I‚Äôm going traveling soon and need to do the same. Where‚Äôd you get the containers? [removed] I do. I was halfway through decanting my vitamin c when I thought, ‚Äúwait...this might be an issue‚Äù. So i probably wouldn‚Äôt repeat it for the vitamin C, and I‚Äôve also heard things about it affecting SPF also. The other stuff I‚Äôm less worried about. They do sell like amber glass containers or opaque ones if you really wanted to. I had this problem with CeraVe Healing Ointment - I decanted it into a bunch of clear lip balm tubes and the one I left in the living room oxidized, probably from sunlight. It turned yellow and smelled rancid. The one I kept in the bathroom didn't do that.

I know Lotioncrafter sells [opaque white plastic ones](https://lotioncrafter.com/collections/containers-packaging/products/airless-treatment-pump-bottle-white-50ml) but I don't know if they are reusable, I haven't gotten through one yet to try refilling it. So I did this right before I went traveling because I wanted to take my products with me, so i would have either been buying travel sized products (if they made them) or doing this anyways because some of these products come in larger containers.
Like i said in my post, it‚Äôs cumbersome and I don‚Äôt know how practical or necessary it is to do. It‚Äôs also questionable with products like the vitamin C serum in terms of exposure to light and destabilization of the product, plus the CEO already comes in a 1 oz bottle that‚Äôs relatively compact. So I wouldnt exactly recommend everyone do this if they weren‚Äôt traveling or whatever, this was more experimental for me and I liked the results.

Edit typo Right? Good lord. And I like these travel containers as opposed to ones you can get at target or whatever because they use all of the product and are easily refillable. Yeah I mean that‚Äôs my perspective. I can understand people calling out decanting a full bottle of cleanser or lotion into another bottle because ~aEtHeTiCs~ but these are travel sized. It truly doesn‚Äôt make sense to me why people are so butthurt about this...and I agree. Don‚Äôt call me out for being ‚Äúwasteful‚Äù when you‚Äôre not suggesting an alternative. What do you do when you travel as an alternative? All I know is people using travel sized containers or purchasing travel sized products which is the same amount of waste. The benefit is these are refillable and washable, so I could theoretically use them indefinitely for any type of product. They have a bunch on amazon if you search airless pumps. I liked the fact that these had caps and are refillable. Had no issues with traveling or leaking People have been doing this for a while. It makes a lot of sense to do so, especially if people travel. I don't know who peed in your cheerios but it wasn't the original poster. The "get a personality" makes no sense and is also extremely unnecessary. Get a....personality? You ok?

It looks nice but isn‚Äôt the primary reason I did it as I said in my post. What do you do when you travel? I truly fail to see how putting my products into travel sized containers so I can fly is dumb but I mean, go off sis. Of course I liked the fact that I could see how much product was left in the container, but if you had a particular product you were concerned about, those would be great.

I‚Äôd have to do some more research to see what products would be really badly affected by exposure, but the benefit of these containers are they‚Äôre small so I should be able to go through the product in them relatively quickly. They shouldn‚Äôt sit for 6 months or more. Yeah, but don‚Äôt fool yourself into defending yourself so much. You don‚Äôt need to be defensive at all regardless of your reasons. You can bet these people downvoting your are living lives a billion times more wasteful and excessive than this every day and they don‚Äôt care about it. Travel, especially plane travel, is a billion times more harmful than a few bottles, but no one complains about that, nor are they stopping themselves I‚Äôm sure. Just know that morons are reading your post, it‚Äôs as simple as that. Yet now people are now downvoting me without offering any alternatives! What is this freaking hive-mind that deemed making your products travel friendly so evil? This is absurd. Lol thanks, yeah not sure where the anger is coming from. Maybe people think these are like big containers that I‚Äôve transferred all the contents into, but they‚Äôre actually small, 1-3oz bottles Liked your post, thanks for the reviews! I have some sunscreen in a small opaque airless container, it's so much easier to keep in my purse but I haven't emptied it to find out if it's refillable.

After my tube of healing ointment went bad I realized a lot of products come in opaque containers. I don't know how necessary that is for products that don't have SPF or Vit C but I'm definitely more cautious now. I just use the cheap refillable ones from Target when I travel but they're definitely not as nice as these!

Oh one time I forgot to label my containers before I left home, and after a few days I realized I was "washing" my face with lotion instead of CeraVe Hydrating cleanser. Oops, sorry face. Oh yeah, I‚Äôm not too worked up about it tbh. Honestly just baffling. And yeah I certainly am not touting some eco friendly lifestyle Np! Its funny what makes people angry. I have very similar bottles and transferred all my stuff for my overseas trips this year. :) **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I know! I can never wait and patch test except for acids. And when I break out it I can't figure out which product was the culprit. 1. I‚Äôm acne-prone, with combination skin (dry and oily in areas). I hoped to get some K-beauty products to help with dullness, redness and acne and these products seemed to do the trick!

2. I use all the products in the image, in order from the Banila Clean it Zero (dimethicone-free) all the way left to the sunscreen in the AM. The only exceptions are I don‚Äôt double cleanse in the morning and I plan to use the Jeju mask only once in a while after trying it last night. Instead of the balm in the morning, I use the cleanser to the left of that, followed by Paula‚Äôs Choice 2% BHA (not in the picture), and work my way down through the essence, serums, and moisturizer. 
Also I prefer using the Klairs at night, so instead I use the snail repairing gel cream in the AM because it mattifies me for some time. The Klairs is really nourishing and good for deep hydration in the PM. My face does seem to have become brighter and bouncier in the last 2 days too. 

3. Almost all the products are scent-free or have just subtle smells. I think the ones with the strongest scents are the Klairs, Banila CO Clean it Zero, and the IUNIK centella foaming cleanser. The rest go on smooth and I can feel it all get absorbed into my skin. Even the tackiest-feeling one (the snail bee ultimate serum) gets soaked really fast. 

The only product I seem to have reacted to is the MIZON AHA 8% peel serum (not in the picture) but I think that‚Äôs a general reaction I get to glycolic acid in a high percentage. My face had broken out in little whiteheads when I woke up this morning, but they‚Äôre mostly gone now within these past few hours thanks to the routine. 

I also keep the Vitamin C in the fridge to make sure it doesn‚Äôt oxidize, and that plus the new Purito unscented sunscreen I received today are the only two products I haven‚Äôt tried yet.

I know a toner is missing from this routine, but that‚Äôs on my next list of things to buy. I‚Äôm looking at the Innisfree Jeju pore toner and the IUNIK propolis serum and think they‚Äôll be good additions but I‚Äôm still doing some research on them and reading reviews. 


The Some By Mi serum and gel were gifts I purchased for my roomie because her skin was dull and she appeared to have gotten darker. I noticed her skin was brighter and lighter today, and mentioned it as well, and she confirmed she saw it too this morning on her way out to the gym. All these results are from 4 days of use, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what one month will look like for us! This is awesome! I was looking for K- and J-Beauty website in Canada beside YesStyle (bc they take forever to ship), so this is absolutely helpful. Thanks for the suggestions as well. Cheers That innisfree mask is great! I hope you love it. It‚Äôs cleansing without drying or making your face feel tight it‚Äôs the best clay mask I‚Äôve used Please give an update as to how your face feels after a few weeks of the products, though. I'm just getting into Kbeauty skincare and would love to know your thoughts. The story of our lives haha. I‚Äôm glad I figured the MIZON serum out quickly and took it out of my routine this morning after using it last night. Yes it is!! You‚Äôre absolutely right...It felt so good and clean when I used it (until I ruined it by applying the MIZON AHA peel serum after) and a little goes a very long way! I‚Äôm glad I got it because it was the last one in stock when I purchased it. I‚Äôm going to retry it alone in a few days and hopefully it gives me the same experience as the first time. I‚Äôd love to...they‚Äôll be used religiously and I‚Äôll update any changes myself and the roomie see Yes I‚Äôve had mine at least 6 months and not even half gone! I sure wish I would have cared about my skin this much when I was 18.  Your collection looks similar to mine!! Which do you prefer between the two (klairs and cosrx) vitamin c serums? also is that sunscreen behind the shea moisture? It looks familiar :)  kinda unrelated - but the little figurines of the cats are so cute! what are those three little dolls? how cute!! It looks like a shrine- I love it! How‚Äôs the freeman mask? Your dolls and cats are so cute! Could you tell me about the elf hydrating serum? can i get your thoughts on the no7 cream and the shea moisture mask? I've always had pretty clear skin but now my skin is even better, even more clear, soft, glowy , and I get more compliments than ever before.

Tell me if u want to know more about a certain product Oh wow twins lol. I like both but I prefer the cosrx better because it's a bit more lightweight and really makes your skin smooth but the klairs one was a good one to start out with. Yeah that's the Missha Essence Sun Milk Sunscreen . I'm pretty sure the 2 little cat glosses are the ones from Forever 21.  I have them too! Yes I love them ! Some erasers I got from daiso Thank you ! It has one of the best smells ever, so ocean and refreshing can't describe it lol and it just kinda soothes/refreshes your skin, not life changing but I wouldn't mind buying it again. Thanks obsessed with little things like that. The e.l.f serum feels like a lightweight mositurizer but isn't heavy . It hydrates pretty well and plumps my skin up a bit. All in all I think it's a good simple serum if you just want hydration won't do much else like brightening etc.  The no 7 cream feels really nice and moisturizing, it's like rich but not heavy if that  makes sense. Sinks in well. I also love the smell , it has a high-end smell  to me, feels more luxurious than it's cost . Overall I really like it and would repurchase. 

The Shea Moisture Mask makes my skin really soft  Don't know why I got downvotes on this lol
 Yeah they are, got them on sale lol. Thanks :-) Great, thanks! I‚Äôve been looking for some more hydration products :) I got them on sale too!    Bought them mainly because they were too cute to pass up :) Oh thank goodness I'm not the only one looking for help and being in my 30's.  I only have one tip, but that is HA on wet (not damp) skin after cleansing. I do this in the morning and give it time to dry before continuing with a barrier maintenance routine, then do actives at night. That little adjustment has made the world of difference in how well the HA works for me!  The anti-aging topicals that we know work for sure for long-term benefit are sunscreen, moisturizers, vitamin A, vitamin B3, and vitamin C. These products work together to preserve collagen, induce collagen production, and reduce hyperpigmentaion. 

For short term improvements we can use chemical exfoliants like AHAs (Glycolic acid, lactic acid, azelaic acid) and BHAs (salicylic acid). You can use them on a daily basis at low percentages, and you can also do chemical peels. The AHAs are better for anti-aging purposes whereas BHA is more for acne reduction. By removing the outermost layer of dead skin cells they make your skin look smoother and brighter, and they make it easier for the above vitamins to penetrate your skin. 

So all of these products but the buffet are definitely good moves. They're all a moisturizer of some sort. The retinoid is vitamin A plus emollient. The rose hip oil is a natural antioxidant and emollient. The hyaluronic acid products are humectants. The only reason I exclude the buffet is because there just isn't much research to show that the peptides do anything significantly different from consistent moisturizer use. But, I think buffet is fun. I don't really think it works, but I also have a bottle. It's worth a shot, right?

Once you've had some time figuring out this routing you could try including a vitamin C product, or a glycolic.

I don't know if you've heard all of this before or not, but I figured I'd throw it in here just in case. :) Turning 30 soon as well. If you email Deciem with a list of products, they‚Äôll email back a routine. Pretty great!

I would just be sure to include SPF, if you‚Äôre not doing so already, since I didn‚Äôt see it pictured. Of the products you purchased, I have the Alpha Arbutin and use it after toner (Thayers) in my AM routine. It‚Äôs slowly but surely helping with PIH.  Great. Will try and see if it works. Thanks again! I thought I was doing top level service for my face with regenerist at 29 and I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs not the case. Good luck! You probably know this, but please patch test!!! The HA gave me two HUGE breakouts, obviously, everyone is different, but another product may break you out as well!  So barely tapping the skin after washing? Thanks so much for the assist. I‚Äôm feeling a pleasant tightness from HA this second but I want to do it your way tonight. üòÄ not OP, but that was some helpful information, thank you! also, happy cake day Thanks for your reply! I‚Äôll email them, I‚Äôve done one AM since just receiving this and I did the Alpha Arbutin first on my tan cheekbone blotches (parting gift from birth control pills) then Buffet then HA. I hope we both have distant memories of pigment issues soon. üòÄ
I have been using neutrogena baby spf on my face but I‚Äôm open to any recommendations of course too.  Hyaluronic acid is a humectant. If your skin feels tight after applying it then that means it's drawing moisture from your skin instead of from the environment. It's supposed to draw moisture to your skin, not away from it, so your skin shouldn't feel tight after applying it. If it does feel tight, then it's not doing what it's supposed to :/

It doesn't work for every skin type in every environment. Try it with the water on your skin first, then the HA, then a moisturizer on top. If your skin still feels tight after doing it this way, then the HA products may not be for you. 

Related short read: [How to get the most out of your moisturizer](https://labmuffin.com/layering-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-moisturiser/).  Worth a try, no actives involved so it‚Äôs less risky to experiment with! I don‚Äôt even touch my face after washing my cleanser off, just get a full dropper of HA and put it straight on. If my skin‚Äôs extra dry I even put a second layer on after a minute or so. YMMV but for me it‚Äôs the one thing that I can go totally overboard with without any negative effects. Thank you!! I'm so excited you noticed it was my cake day!
 If you‚Äôve got one that works for you and is SPF 30+, stick with it! üôÇ No need to spend extra $$$ if you don‚Äôt need to, IMO.  Thx for explaining it so well. I didn‚Äôt know that about HA and thought that it‚Äôs natural to feel skin tightening when applying HA. It is not for me then! It‚Äôs an exciting idea. I‚Äôm curious how the wet skin will work for me.  I hate the thick lotion feeling but want to use 60+ lol. I need to be more conversational with you all so I actually do the spf daily üòî.  Hyaluronic Acid can also safely draw moisture from your skin‚Äôs lower layers. Keeping yourself hydrated by drinking enough water is important. Your skin will constantly renew its moisture, it‚Äôs not as of HA is going to steal it all. 

Applying it to damp skin, patting on, and then spraying it again with water, I use Avene thermal water, but any water will do, and then sealing it in with a moisturizer may really help make a difference for you.  I literally wrote my routine in expo marker on my bathroom mirror until I had it as a habit üòÖüòÇ La Roche-Posay has some really light sunscreens that are high in SPF! My HG is their anthelios mineral SPF 50 sunscreen, but they have a SPF 60 version too.  I‚Äôm a newbie so no advice but I love your candles lol Your routine doesn‚Äôt look bad at all! The only thing I could recommend changing is the order of some of your products, but that‚Äôs just nit picky because they look fine honestly. I was never a big fan of Luna Oil and vastly prefer other retinol products. In addition, adding in a BP and switching to a BHA acid to replace one of your AHA products may help you more with breakouts. One thought is maybe you are overdoing it with the acids. I found that if I exfoliated every night my skin was always constantly a tiny bit irritated by how much I was doing to it, so I never got the beautiful glowy results I was expecting from my acid products.  So wait, you are exfoliating every day both morning and night? That is a lot. I agree with others that you should cut back, only exfoliate once in a day and maybe not every day either.

Also, you might be interested in azelaic acid for redness and acne. It is not an exfoliant, so you should be able to use it in conjunction with your AHAs, but it could also be used on off days only if you want to take it easy. Using the exfoliating pads everyday could be the cause of your dry skin. I would stop for a few weeks and see if it improves. If  you see a difference you can introduce the pads slowly. I would recommend using them just 2/3 times a week or even less. Or at least leave a day between each of them.  Hi everyone! Long time lurker and first time poster, I was wondering if you guys could help me out with my skin problems! I'm not sure what order I need to do these steps in and if I'm missing anything out.


AM: Wipe with micellar water, alternating days either use the nip and fab glycolic pads or Pixi's Glow tonic, Benefit eye cream, glossier moisturiser and the Coola sunscreen.


PM: Wash with Simple moisturizing face wash, micellar water on a cotton pad to remove any leftovers, TO glycolic acid, eye cream, either Simple night cream or Origins drink up mask and then Sunday Riley Luna oil.


I have quite a lot of redness and no matter how much I moisturize my skin is always very dry. My pores are huge and I get the odd hormonal pimple every month. If anyone could help me improve this I would be much obliged! 

Also, sorry if the formatting is weird. I've never written anything this long and I'm on a mobile! Thanks in advance! Putting your products near the sun.  The candles aren‚Äôt large enough. Sorry, but that is my diagnosis.  From my experience, it‚Äôs the amount of products you use. I personally like a cleanser with salicylic acid, a light daytime moisturizer and an over night cream with benzoyl peroxide. Idk what all that extra stuff is...   Haha thank you very much! Thank you for replying! What order would you put them in? I've heard work from lightest to heaviest but I'm not sure if Luna should go on before or after my moisturiser. What retinol would you recommend? 

I've been using Luna for about 1 month now and I'm not seeing any massive differences if I'm honest so I'm totally open to something different or any other moisturiser üòä what BHA would you also recommend to replace an AHA? Sorry for all the questions, I've no one else to get information from haha  Yeah I've realised the error of my ways, twice every day is a bit much! 

I'll certainly look into it, have you any recommendations? Hey! I alternate between the pads and glow tonic every other day but sometimes less. I'm trying to use up the glow tonic, so there's maybe 2 or 3 days inbetween? 

My redness has always been an issue well before I used these pads, I wouldn't say it's rosacea but my cheeks are always red regardless of the temperature, if I've just washed my face or done anything. Would you know if there's any sort of "miracle cure" that would help this? Haha they normally sit all crowded together under the sink, don't worry they're not out in sunlight! Yeah exactly! That‚Äôs the problem I always had with Luna too. I‚Äôve used a few different retinols and at the moment use Differin every other night. I have also used the Paula‚Äôs Choice 1% retinol booster which is very nice, but it‚Äôs a bit strong for what I need right now.

3 different exfoliant products, now that I think about it, seems like a lot. I would maybe pick one AHA product to use in the evenings, and then you can also look into a BHA to supplement or replace it. I‚Äôm not sure how it would go applying 2 acid products. I use the Drunk Elephant night serum which has AHA and BHA in it. However I‚Äôve also used with great success the Paula‚Äôs Choice BHA liquid and their 4% weekly foam treatment. Both are very nice and really help with clogged pores in my experience. Lots of people on this sub also recommend the strides pads but I‚Äôve never personally tried them. 

If you cut down on your exfoliants I think you‚Äôll see some nice results as your skin can repair itself a bit. One thing that I started doing that I really like is alternating my actives in the evenings so I‚Äôm not over doing it. One night I‚Äôll do my acid exfoliating, the next my retinol, and switch back. I just found this out through trial and error to work for my skin, but you can try it for yourself and see if it works! Good luck üçÄ Melazepam. It's available on Amazon. Hi! 

I was thinking something like this:

Monday: glow tonic
Tuesday: nothing
Wednesday: pads
Thursday: nothing
Friday: glow tonic
Saturday: nothing
Sunday: pads. 

And so on. 

For reducing redness its always good to avoid irritants like alcohol, peppermint, eucalyptus and fragrance. 

Aloe vera, cucumber and snail are good for redness I believe. 

I have used those in the past for reducing redness after a allergic reaction. 

 Thank you for that, I was under the impression you could use glow tonic every day but I'll certainly take that on board!  You‚Äôre welcome! :)

Because its a exfoliater it can dry out your skin. I
Believe witch hazel can be drying and irritating as well. Everyones skin is different, thats why some people can use it everyday, others might have to use it less. I use the Paula‚Äôs choice BHA liquid, the instructions say to use it everyday but I know my skin doesnt like that. So I just use it once or twice a week.  **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I always have a travel comfort bag at easy reach!  I'm intrigued by the Minon Amino Moist mist.  What's the benefit of each mist? /u/brunchesatbergdorfs thanks for sharing all of your helpful BR advice! I am on my second bottle of P50 1970 and love it. I am looking to invest in a few more BR products, but don't really know where to start. I am a 23 yo F, with normal skin (on the dry side), some fine lines. I am either looking to add in a serum or purchase a moisturizer. Right now, I am using Skinceuticals CE Feurlic (looking to replace with BR) Have you found that any BR serums that mimic the effects of Vitamin C serum? Also, debating on these products: **Serum Oligo Proteines Marines, Serum Elastine Pure, Serum Placenta (kinda confused what this does), Serum A Glyca, Serum YALL, Amniotique, Masque Vernix OR Vivant.** Also, any products you suggest for dry skin under eyes? Thanks so much for your insight on BR products! Here‚Äôs my routine for a long-haul flight! 

**I know that people on this sub doesn‚Äôt recommend doing a routine on a flight because the recycled air and bacteria but I don‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I do it cause my skin gets dry af and I always land with glowing hydrated skin. Anyway, you do you.**

Skin type: Dry dehydrated, psoriasis, and redness-prone 

Age: 23F

Location: Ughhh... transpacific flight? üòÇ

Products:

Freshdrop Pure Mineral Water - this isn‚Äôt just any mineral water spray! It has tomato extract, arbutin, lecithin, vit e, collagen, vit c, etc. I spray it to moisten my skin to remove any dust or residues from being at the airport. You can use it as a mist too but I prefer to use it to clean my skin since I don‚Äôt want to use airplane water on my face. Unfortunately, this product can only be purchased in Thailand. 10/10

Minon Amino Full Shower - someone on Reddit recommended me this and thank you, kind sir! It‚Äôs so soothing and hydrating. I believe it contains amino acids like serine and valine. It was pretty cheap like $10? I don‚Äôt remember the exact price. 10/10

Japanese sheet masks - I‚Äôm so sorry but I don‚Äôt the name of these masks of anyone know please tell me! I bought about ten boxes because it was on sale and it has placenta and HA. Super hydrating and moisturizing. The serum has a jelly texture and it has no to little fragrance. I put this on once every hour when I‚Äôm still awake. 10/10

Biologique Recherche Creme Metamorphique - this has amniotic fluid as the second ingredient and it has a moisturizing property. Honestly, I‚Äôve never used this but I ran out of my creme Masque vernix sample so I used that instead. I put a thick layer on before I go to sleep. 5/10

Biologique Recherche Creme Contour des Yeux et Levres Biofixine - a lip and eue creme. I think it‚Äôs okay. Nothing too special. Its main ingredients are Shea butter. 2/10

Vaseline Lip Therapy - my holy grail lip balm; smells like cheap roses perfume and it‚Äôs thick and occlusive af and kept my lips from drying. 10/10

**To all you Sunday Riley fans out there, United provides amenities lot with Sunday Riley products** Sorry for a late reply! I‚Äôm pretty sure that oligo-proteins marine is supposed to be the alternative to vit c in BR! Elastine pure was discontinued and replaced with plant-based ingredients (peptides and HA), I honestly wouldn‚Äôt buy it because of the price ($122) for something I could easily find for less. 

Placenta is really my favorite. I guess the best way to describe what is does is that it repairs your skin (redness, erythema after acne, etc. I think you should give it a try. Also, you can use placenta and oligo under your eyes to combat dry and dark circle under eyes. 

BR doesn‚Äôt recommend you to use eye creme at night because it cause puffiness, they recommend using their quintessential serums (placenta, oligo, elastine) at night and use eye creme in the morning. I‚Äôve used their eye cremes (VIPO2 and BIofixine) and they weren‚Äôt nothing special but I am curious about the biosensible eye creme! It has amazing ingredients! Also, you can use vernix under your eyes‚Äîa BR international trainee told me that.

I finished a bottle of A-Glyca but didn‚Äôt see much difference, I think you have to use it in a course of three months but it won‚Äôt really have any result on you because you‚Äôre still young; it‚Äôs more like a preventative serum for anti-aging.

I haven‚Äôt tried the new Amniotique yet but I think I will get it next time to try because I hated their colostrum serum. Haven‚Äôt tried yall 2 either but if you‚Äôre skin is just dry and still young I would just try fluide VIPO2 first cause it‚Äôs cheaper and practically the same... yall 2 just had HA added into it.

I LOVE VERNIX, it‚Äôs the best thing that ever happen to my skin. I use it as a moisturizer not a mask. You will wake up with a super glowy and moist skin after using it.

Vivant is also good but if you‚Äôre on a drier side it might be too drying for you cause after all it‚Äôs a clay-based mask. I‚Äôm dry and I mix with masque VIPO2 or masque biosensible and it works perfectly fine for me :)

Hope this helps :) [removed] What do you mean by spray products?? üòÇ sorry I‚Äôm not sure I get it haha. Could your elaborate? :) [removed] Oh you mean like a moisturising mist?? I LOVE IT but it is definitely not hydrating enough for me, I have to lock it in with a creme or a super thick mask! 

I have tried eucerin ointment spray before and it was the most disgusting thing I‚Äôve ever put on my skin. It‚Äôs like petroleum but in a spray form ü§£. It doesn‚Äôt get absorbed and you literally have to run it in. It was greasy and sticky ü§Æ **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I never got the hate, I use chemical exfoliants now but I still do a lil scrubba dub with the st Ives every now and then I will never give up my apricot scrub! At least I use it just once a week now rather than every day like I did in highschool haha. [from left]

AM/PMcetaphil daily facial cleanser and cerave foaming cleanser - my tried and true go tos that i always end up going back to for daily morning & night cleansers, lightweight, both non comedogenic and dermatologist recommended, no funky perfumes or fragrances, super gentle and mild but still leave my skin feeling nice and clean after

AM/PMcetaphil moisturizing body and face lotion - (you can see the green pump hiding behind the face scrub) another tried and true, always come back to my default everyday moisturizer, its lightweight enough i can use it on my oily skin and its just heavy enough to get the job done on my normal and my dry skin, another lightweight, gentle and mild formula but it works.

PMst. ive's gentle smoothing oatmeal scrub + mask & st. ive's fresh skin apricot scrub - just so we're all clear, yes i am aware that this brand's scrubs have a reputation for really not being all that great for your skin like they claim and possibly even being responsible for causing damage. with that being said i wouldn't recommend someone else take my word for it and use them, but i decided that i still like the scrubs and i still feel that they work for me for my pre-mask exfoliant and 2/3x a week scrub, so i'm still gonna use them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

PMpond's cold cream cleanser - one of my all time favorite products, makeup remover, deep cleanser and intense moisturizer all in one step. in the colder months i use it at least a few times a week, sometimes i'll just use it as my PM cleanser, but it's too thick and heavy of a formula to use more than once a week during the hot summer months . i still use it all year round though because i love it so much and there truly isn't another drugstore product that melts your makeup right off and simultaneously deep cleans and moisturizes. noxzema is a very similar product, menthol scented and with maybe a slightly lighter formula more suitable for summer months, but pond's is arguably the better product of the two by far.

AM/PMgarnier skinactive moisture rescue refreshing gel cream - my 2nd everyday moisturizer that i just recently added to my everyday routine that i layer over my Cetaphil lotion over the areas i get real dry skin and flaky, those two together just work for my dry patches because i haven't starting getting flaky since

PMgarnier skinactive moisture bomb mattifying sheet mask - it's exactly what it sounds like to someone who's never used it before - it's a moisture bomb. it was definitely a little off putting when i used it the first time and it came out of the packaging s o a k e d with product, and getting used to having something so heavy and WET sitting on your face for mad long, then the mask comes off and all the residue is just sitting on your skin but once it starts to dissolve into your skin it's super hydrating and moisturizing and leaves you with a lil shine after, i ended up actually liking it and what it did for my skin so much i decided to make it more of a regular routine, now i'll grab one a couple times a month and use one.

AM/PMdickinson's enhanced witch hazel alcohol free hydrating toner - another new addition to the everyday routine for my normal to dry skin and areas i get super dry and flaky, has a mild, natural earthy type scent to it, does its job as a toner while still being very hydrating.
 
AMgarnier skinactive cleansing micellar water - this ended up being a product i didn't have nearly as much uses for that i anticipated, mainly i use it on cotton swabs/pads or washcloths for removing makeup or correcting mistakes in my eye makeup, and i've used it to give my skin a quick freshening up and wake up splash for when i'm rushing getting ready and don't have time to wash my face, and if you see right behind the micellar water is a very similar looking bottle but it's the garnier skinactive foaming micellar cleanser and being that i've used multiple of the micellar waters in my skincare routine, now i wanna test out the micellar cleanser and see what that's all about, but it being a foaming cleanser was what really sold me being that foaming cleansers tend to be the best kind for my skin type, then it was like a sign to try it....now i just gotta figure out how i'm gonna incorporate it into my routine. Will the st yves work great for the body ? no one will stop me from scrubba dubbing with my st. ives never ever!!!! i have the apricot and oatmeal scrub in this picture, another one of their scrubs that comes in a pink bottle and a whole other unopened bottle of apricot for when i finish the jar in the photo üòÇ and even with two other options from the same brand to choose from, that famous apricot is still my favorite scrub for my exfoliating days and for prepping my skin for a mask üòÇ i use mine probably once a week to exfoliate and once for before a mask and as long as it keeps working for me nobody can tell me nothin ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ i've never used it on the body myself, but i have seen other people say they do because they don't want to use it on their face and it works for them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I miss the smell of that apricot scrub tbh Okey thanks ! **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Here‚Äôs the routine that goes with it!

MORNING:

[Jan Marini Biogylcolic Face Cleanser](https://www.janmarini.com/bioglycolic-reg-face-cleanser.html): I don‚Äôt see a lot of people on here using Jan Marini but I‚Äôve been using this face wash for 10+ years. They make one for oily skin (which I have) but it was waaay too harsh.

[Skinceuticals Phloretin CF](https://www.skinceuticals.com/phloretin-cf-with-ferulic-acid-635494328004.html): I switched to this one from an Obagi product. I do think its better, although pricier. I went with this one (over the CE Ferulic) because I‚Äôm on the oily side.

[Obagi Exfoderm Forte](https://www.dermstore.com/product_NuDerm+Exfoderm+Forte_1176.htm): I have also been on this forever - like 12 or 13 years. I use the Forte because it‚Äôs for oilier skin types.

[EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46](https://eltamd.com/product/uv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf-46/): I had used Obagi and Jan Marini sunscreens in the past, but after seeing my dermatologist for a treatment they put this on me before I left and I LOVE it.

EVENING:

Jan Marini Bioglycolic Face Wash: Same product I use in the mornings.

[Obagi Clear](https://www.obagi.com/patients/product-line/obagi-nu-derm-system/clear): I apply this to mostly dry skin.

[Obagi Blender](https://www.obagi.com/patients/product-line/obagi-nu-derm-system/blender) + .1% Tretinoin (Retin-A): I blend these two together in my hands and apply 20-30 minutes after I apply clear. The skin around my eyes, my nostrils and chin is more sensitive to the Retin-A, so I let it sit for like 20-30 minutes after applying and then run a wet cotton round lightly across these areas. This has helped prevent any peeling.

[Skinceuticals AGE Eye Complex](https://www.skinceuticals.com/a.g.e.-eye-complex-for-dark-circles-635494358001.html?cgid=products-category-eye-and-lip-care#start=1&cgid=lip-and-eye-care): Dark circles aren‚Äôt actually an issue for me, so I‚Äôm not sure if this is doing anything. I started Botox on the outside of my eyes this year and I asked my derm if I should use an eye cream and he said ‚ÄúYeah, you could try that. Obagi makes a nice one...‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure why I ended up getting this one...

BODY:

[Jan Marini Biogylcolic Resurfacing Body Scrub](https://www.janmarini.com/bioglycolic-reg-resurfacing-body-scrub.html): I use this a couple of times a week for the acne in my back and chest. Sometimes if I want a good exfoliating on my face, I‚Äôll use it there. I‚Äôm not sure this is worth the price.

Clindamyacin Phosphate: I use this for the acne on my back. I only need to use it about 3 times a week.

[Obagi Keraphine](https://www.obagi.com/patients/product-line/keraphine): This is AMAZING for keratosis pilaris! I only have to use 2-3 time a week for much, much smoother skin.

CeraVe: I actually use CeraVe on my body and my face. It‚Äôs the best!

I have been on many of these products (especially the Obagi ones) for so long. When I run out of my Clear and Blender I may take a break and see if hyperpigmentation is still an issue for me. When I‚Äôm done with the Skinceuticals eye cream I‚Äôll probably ditch it. I may try an Obagi one, but my eyes aren‚Äôt one of my problem areas. Thanks for showing your routine! Just out of curiosity if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, other than Botox do you get any other derm procedures? And how often? Botox: 2-3 times a year on my forehead, between my eyebrows and the outside corners of my eyes.

IPL: I‚Äôve done this twice in my forehead to target some stubborn hyperpigmentation.

Hydrafacial: WOW. I did my first one of these about a month ago and it‚Äôs about 100x better than microdermabrasion! I‚Äôd like to try to do these a couple of times a year, maybe before a big event like the holidays or a wedding. **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* This is so pretty That mad hippie SPF looks bomb. I want to try their cream cleanser. I really wanted to love that SPF but it leaves the worst white cast on my face üò¢ it smells lovely like floral water though I love the smell of the watermelon glow and the ordinary niacinamide + zinc made my skin clearer! Also, mouse twins! It‚Äôs super cute and feels AMAZING. taken at my desk because i never leave it, even to do my skincare routine!!!

jokes aside this has been my current quarantine routine, i'm planning on switching some products out once i'm done with them just to try new things. for reference i'm in my early 20s and my skin is somewhat dry and dull, but my main concerns are dark circles and eye bags from when i was a kid staying up late playing pokemon :< i used to be super into korean skincare in high school but i've gotten lazy over the years, so during quarantine i've been trying to learn more!

&#x200B;

AM:

i literally just splash my face with water then apply my mad hippie sunscreen + murad eye cream. i'm not particularly attached to either-- i picked up the sunscreen at whole foods when i was running low and thought it'd just give it a try! i like that it's super lightweight and doesn't leave too much of a white cast, but looking to try something else. as for the eye cream, i know they're not really a necessity but since my biggest concern is under eye circles i figured it wouldn't hurt! pretty moisturizing and i like that it has some spf but haven't noticed too much of a difference in terms of lightening or anything

PM:

tatcha cleansing oil: i only use this a few times a week or so to double cleanse, but if i'm wearing makeup i will always use this first! does a really good job of breaking down my makeup without having to use too many pumps because tatcha is expensive af... i used the dhc cleansing oil throughout high school and college and will probably go back to that when i run out of this

burt's bees sensitive facial cleanser: i like the cream consistency of this but similar to the mad hippie sunscreen, i just picked it up out of necessity and i'm not super attached to it. i like that it is super gentle and doesn't feel like my face has been stripped clean, but i bought the la roche-posay hydrating cleanser and will be trying that soon!

tatcha the essence: i really like this product but because it's so pricey don't think i will be purchasing again!! the bottle is huge though and i can't remember how long i've had it but i'm nowhere near done with it. i like to think it helps my following products absorb into my skin better

the ordinary niacinamide + zinc: this is one product that i bought as a result of bingeing youtube videos recently. i've been using it for a month and i like to think my skin looks a little more supple? i'm excited to continue using it!

drunk elephant tlc framboos night serum: i alternate between using this and the ordinary niacinamide because i actually haven't looked up if you can use them together yet lol. i've been using this for about a year now and it's greatly improved my skin! it definitely keeps my skin clean and clear, and helps to brighten it as well. although i do enjoy this product i've learned that they're not the most customer friendly company out there so i'll be taking my money elsewhere

glow recipe watermelon pink juice moisturizer: i LOVE this!! has so many ingredients that are great for hydration and feels really good on the skin. it's perfect for the summer and keeps my skin hydrated but not too greasy. this little bottle has actually lasted a good while, and i love the glass packaging.

murad essential-c eye cream: wrote more about it in my AM routine but this eye cream is ok! does help keep my eye are moisturized since it's pretty dry but i think that's about it. i'll probably be better off doubling up on the moisturizer [deleted] Absolutely love the sailor moon figures thank you sm!! ngl the pretty packaging got me! i haven't tried any of their other stuff yet but will probably do so in the future it's so lightweight!! the smell is really really nice too though i know a lot of people dislike fragrance in their products yesss the watermelon moisturizer smells like candy!! ngl i only got the mouse bc it was pink and adorable but i ended up really liking the way it fits in my hand I'm assuming you keep all this at your desk too(I do the same lol, I play a match and put a layer on lmao), how do you store it? I got one of those lazy susan tower things but it isn't the prettiest sitting out imo. 

&#x200B;

Have you seen the new razor mini keyboard? I want it so bad T\_T thank you!! thank you, i love love sailor moon <3 I've done some looking into ingredients and they seem really good for the price point. ahaha i was just kidding about the desk part, i was actually really extra and hauled everything over from my bathroom for the picture... i usually keep it in my medicine cabinet!

YES I HAVE it's so cute!! i wish it came in pink because the one i have is a little too big... don't really use the numpad :c **Hello everyone!**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Is this an advertisement? What do you know about the moisture barrier? Dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin is kind of the calling card of a damaged moisture barrier. Plus you‚Äôve been on accutane? I really wonder if you‚Äôd benefit from trying to focus on restoring that wonderful, beautiful, easily damaged barrier. 

Glad your skin is finally happy! :) I‚Äôve had acne prone skin my whole life, with some moderate scarring. I believe 2 rounds of Accutane made my skin also very sensitive to the sun, so I‚Äôve developed hyperpigmentation on my face.
For many years I used harsh scrubs & astringents. Finally a dermatologist clued me in that my skin was dry, not oily as I‚Äôd thought. She also performed an ‚Äòacne surgery‚Äô for me that removed deep acne spots.
My current regime is AM; wash with Phytomer Souffl√© Marin cleansing foam, then the Energizing Oxegenating serum, then the Citylife. The Citylife pulls toxins & acne out of my skin, not sure how to explain it. The Souffl√© Marin products clean my skin without drying/dulling.
In PM: same cleansing foam, then Rosee Soin (a dry oil), then the Pionierre XMF White to help with anti-aging & hyperpigmentation.
That‚Äôs the regime now and I‚Äôm happy with the results! No, I‚Äôm a real person. I‚Äôm not sure about the moisture barrier damage, but I do have Sjogren‚Äôs, so dryness is an overall body issue for me. 
Right now, this regime works for me, but in a year or so I may need to re-evaluate. **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* This is my first post here so trying to follow the rules & instructions exactly. If I do this wrong, I‚Äôm sorry & please tell me what‚Äôs wrong so I can fix it!

I have combination skin, moderate acne mostly on chin & cheeks. Some blackheads on nose.

AM: Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser (for cleansing) Sunday Riley Martian Toner (for toning) Sunday Riley Tidal Moisturizer (for moisture)
PM: Truly CBD Jelly Anti-Acne Cleanser every other day (cleansing, for acne) Glamglow TropicalCleanser Daily Exfoliating Cleanser the other days (not pictured, for exfoliating), Sunday Riley Martian Toner (for toning), Sunday Riley UFO Oil (for acne), Clean & Clear Spot Treatment (for acne) SheaMoisture African Black Soap Moisturizer for Problem Skin (for moisture & acne).
Twice weekly: Truly Hemp Jelly Anti Acne Face Mask (moisture & acne)

Reviews in reply. How long have you used these products so far? Maybe try adding a sunscreen? Otherwise if everything works for you then it looks like a nice routine! Cetaphil Daily Cleanser: like this so far, it cleans well but doesn‚Äôt leave my face too dry.

Sunday Riley Martian: love this! It‚Äôs a nice toner but doesn‚Äôt feel too chemically like some toners.

Sunday Riley Tidal: not too heavy while still moisturizing well!

Truly CBD Cleanser: cleans well, doesn‚Äôt leave skin too dry or stripped.

Glamglow Tropicalcleanse: does a good job exfoliating without being too harsh.

Sunday Riley UFO: doesn‚Äôt leave skin too greasy, seems to work well on blackheads. Some people say it smells weird but I don‚Äôt mind it as long as it works!

Clean & Clear Spot Treatment: Haven‚Äôt been using for very long, will report back once I‚Äôve formed an opinion. 

Shea Moisture Problem Skin Moisturizer: moisturizes well, not too heavy. This was discontinued the day after I got mine so I‚Äôm looking for a replacement that isn‚Äôt too expensive. Anyone have any recommendations?

Truly Anti Acne Mask: I like the way this feels on my skin. Takes like 5 minutes to absorb but my skin feels really soft after it‚Äôs absorbed all the way. I‚Äôve used everything for about a month except the spot treatment. I‚Äôve been using it for maybe 3 days? I‚Äôve been using the UFO, Martian, & Tidal for 2-3 months. If you notice your skin improving, I would continue using it.  I don't have any strong opinions on the products since I have sensitive skin. Which limits me on what I can use.  I would say continue using the same products for the next three months and don't add anything new in the meantime.  If you skin improves, congratulations you found something that works.  If not, just cull your products down to the basics and see what is causing an reaction.  Good luck. That toner absolutely destroyed my skin. Was years ago. Still remember it. Oh the peeling and the tightness and the stinging... I didn‚Äôt read ingredient lists back then. It‚Äôs full of alcohol.  As a looooooong time Clinique 3-steps (and the rest) user (like 10+ years before I switched because it dehydrated my skin) I want to warn you for the alcohol in their toners en very drying facial soaps. I love their moisturising surge still, but if you feel that your skin becomes very tight, you might want to have a look at the cleanser and toner. I use most of these products and they are amazing for my dry skin. Last year my skin started to change and get oilier (but tight) in my T zone after (years) of using the soap and toner. So I switched to the **extra mild** facial soap and and the clarifying lotion **1** and my moisture barrier is back in check!  I also use the cleansing balm to remove sunscreen/makeup before I use the soap at night. I personally love Clinique, it works well for my skin. Lovely product line up. :) Earlier in the month I comepletely ran out of face wash and moisturizer and decided I wanted to return to a life of a full routine, so I went to ULTA and splurged on some Clinique skincare products because they‚Äôve always been great to me. 
They were so pleased they even threw in two full size samples! (Pic goes left to right) 

#Skin type: Combination, oily t zone and dry outer area. 


#Skin concerns: I want all bases covered but I don‚Äôt like feeling like my face is heavy and weighed down. Other than that just hyperpigmentation from the occasional pimple and scarring. 


#Skin goals: smoother texture and evening out dark spots (minimal need but hey). 

Step 1- Mild Facial Soap: a very gentle face wash. Lathers very easily and works great on a quick day

Step 2- Clarifying Lotion twice a day exfoliator: I got the #2 which means combination skin that leans a little more on the dry side. Super gentle and makes you feel squeaky clean! 

Step 3- Moisture Surge 72 hour moisturizing Gel: A little goes a LONG way. I just dab my finger in and can use it on all of my face! Super weightless but VERY nourishing 

Step 4- Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector and Optimizer: Super nice and easy. Make sure to wear with SPF! 

Step 5- All About Eyes Serum: That great little pink rollerball to the right of the photo. Super quick results even without daily use. Also make sure to wear with SPF. 

Step 6- Clinique Broad Spectrum 45 SPF sunscreen stick: Rolls in like a dream, heavier but as a POC it doesn‚Äôt have any ashiness. Clear and actually works! Just roll and spread onto the rest of your face with fingers if it‚Äôs too heavy. 

Step 7- Tarte Amazonian Clay Loose Setting Powder : I use this because it helps keep my face matte, I know a nice dewy look is the trend but as a guy my face gets oily so quick, especially when I use all of the products for a day out. I put some of this on my T zone to mattify and control oil. 

Step 8- Nyx Matte Finish Spray: Seals up the tarte powder and makes everything feel nice and sealed which I like! 

#Free full size samples: 

1- 7 day scrub cream rinse off formula: great micro bead exfoliator. Doesn‚Äôt seem to use plastic beads, I think it‚Äôs sand so that‚Äôs good! 

2- Moisture Surge Overnight mask: This product is great and helped smooth my skin texture. Love it! 

I only use both about once a week



**On busy days or when I‚Äôm lazy/ wake up late I just skip steps 2 and 4 and do everything else. 

Any questions feel free to ask!  A lot of people have shared the same sentiments. I haven‚Äôt had any peeling but don‚Äôt mind the tight feeling, as I figured it was just my pores closing up and a side effect of the witch hazel that‚Äôs in it which I‚Äôve never used before. Is the tightness and mild stinging a bad thing? I always thought as long as your skin didn‚Äôt turn red, those things were just a sign it was working as planned.  [deleted] Thank you! I feel like I missed something on this sub though because Were getting downvoted for saying we like Clinique? Idgi lol Oooh I'm interested in the lil eye roller - what effects have you noticed? I've always wanted to get one to stick in the fridge because that sounds very soothing, but knowing me I'd probably forget that it's in there  Oh honey, nothing you use should make your skin feel tight. Pores don't close or open, they're not doors and they don't have muscles. What that toner is doing is drying your skin out to the point where your skin feels tight.  Not a good good thing. Thank you both for the warning! It hasn‚Äôt damaged my skin, but I also don‚Äôt wash my face every single day, more like every other day. When I first bought it I used it every day twice a day for a week to get my skin used to it, but now I don‚Äôt need to  I know right!? I don't like the hate that clinique gets. My skin loves it and it works for me! I also always get compliments on my skin so I know its working. :) lol  It‚Äôs taken away my purple for sure! Now the bags aren‚Äôt as sunken looking and the tone has evened out. I haven‚Äôt thought of putting it in the fridge but I‚Äôll try it! Tbh though it has great, quick, and noticeable results at room temp 


Ingredients are available [here ](https://m.clinique.com/product/1667/9423/skin-care/all-about-eyes-serum-de-puffing-eye-massage)  I suspect you are getting downvoted for misinformed statements. Ideally, you would be told why they are misinformed, but sometimes all folks have time for is a downvote to show other readers that the comment is inaccurate and should not be taken seriously. For example, you do not need to wash your face twice to day to ‚Äúget your skin used to‚Äù something. The only products that should have an adjustment period are ‚Äúactives‚Äù and those should be used LESS frequently during the adjustment process, not more. In order to prevent other readers from assuming this is healthy skincare, your comment is being downvoted. 

Clinique is a very $$$ brand, and the downvotes are just to show other readers that your perception of the products is not rooted in what we know of skincare science (pores do not open and close, for example, tight skin is toeing the dehydration line at best) which is especially important because some folks WILL spend any amount of money if they are led to believe a product works. It‚Äôs not personal, it‚Äôs just sort of a quick peer review tactic.  Yeah, my skin likes almost everything I've tried from Clinique. Their balm cleanser is still a favorite of mine. I don't really get the hate. Thank you for actually explaining, instead of just downvoting. I do get it,  but I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs not just being regarded as my opinion considering that‚Äôs what it is, and my skin experience will be different from anyone else‚Äôs.  My morning routine is similar to yours. I use the C Firma and B Hyrda with LaLa in the morning instead of Protini (it isn‚Äôt available in my country unfortunately).

Can I ask why you moisturise before applying the C Firma? I was under the impression vit c should go on skin right after cleansing, then followed with a moisturiser.

But if I‚Äôm incorrect then I should change the order I do it! someone's liking their Drunk Elephant üç∏üêò...I loved their Protini and I have A Pasioni as a retinol on my wishlist. I didn't care about their vit C either: I love Joanna Vargas Daily Serum right now for a bit of vit C I know it‚Äôs pretty much all DE products, but damn do they work well for me. I have oily, sensitive skin and their line has been a godsend for me. 

AM

Cleanse with water

Protini moisturizer with two pumps of the B Hydra mixed in

C Firma 

Umbra Sheer sunscreen

Lippe Balm through out the day


PM

Cleanse with CeraVe foaming cleanser (not pictured)

TLC Framboos (let sit for 10 mins)

Protini mixed with B Hydra 

Lala Retro and a few drops Marula Oil

A Passioni (every 2-3 days)

Sukari Baby Facial (once a week)

Keihl‚Äôs Rare Earth clay mask (1-2 times a week)

Most of this stuff is pretty self explanatory but I will say a few thing about each product. 

Protini - excellent day time moisturizer, and made my skin feel more firm

Lala Retro - great moisturizer, use mostly at night, but will add as needed if I feel a little more dry than usual

Umbra Sheer SPF - one of the few sunscreens I can stand. Chemical screens irritate my skin and smell awful in my opinion. Physical sunscreen usually leave me with a white cast and the Umbra leaves virtually no white cast so I‚Äôm happy :)

Lippe Balm - almost didn‚Äôt want to buy this because of the price, but it made such a huge difference! It has actually brightened up my lip color

B Hydra - great moisture boost to my regular moisturizer, and has help reduce redness in my face

Marula Oil - I love how soft my skin feels after I put this on (including my elbows and hands). I have seen a big reduction in oil production since starting this

TLC Framboos - great exfoliant, and the salicylic acid doubles as an acne treatment 

C Firma - have seen a reduction in appearance of acne scars and evening of skin tone. I just wish it didn‚Äôt smell like hotdog water. Might look into another Vit C product after this one. 

A Passioni - have used retinol before, but didn‚Äôt really see results at all. I have seen results much faster with this, but it is irritating at first so i took out my other actives for a few weeks to adjust

Sukari - I use this as a ‚Äúprimer‚Äù almost for my clay mask. 

Keihl‚Äôs Rare Earth mask - great clay mask I got for free at Macy‚Äôs (the lady at the counter gave it to me for free since they didn‚Äôt have the toiletry bag when I bought my cologne). My pores look so clear afterward. Will def be repurchasing once I‚Äôm out.  They‚Äôre ready for their game of chess You're in a very unique position to have really used all of the DE line,  do tell which one is your MVP - most valuable product?  This is such a satisfying photo lol I just purchased The Littles and am hoping they work well for me too! Thanks for the info. If you could only repurchase one or two of these which would you pick and why? Truth me told I actually mix my C Firma in with my moisturizer and apply them at the same time. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the C Firma leaves a tacky film on my skin (and results in me touching my face throughout the day to see how tacky it is ‚Äî increasing my risk for pimples) and mixing it helps lessen that feeling. If I had better discipline in not touching my face I would probably do it the way you‚Äôre doing it ‚Äî which is the right way BTW!!! I will have to check that one out. Thanks! Hol up.

You put DE Marula Oil on your elbows?  Lol. I should buy a chessboard and have them arranged like game pieces. That‚Äôs a cool idea.  I would say their moisturizers are their best products. The Protini would be my HG and the Lala and B Hydra are pretty much tied for second. Third would be the Umbra sunscreen  Glad you think so, I like how they all look together. I‚Äôve gotten a few downvotes for my post and I don‚Äôt know why.  Wish you the best!! I would say the moisturizers. The one or two I would pick would depend on how my skin is feeling. Winter months usually mean Lala since it‚Äôs a bit heavier and Protini is a great everyday moisturizer. The B Hydra would be product number two for sure tho.  After I put on my Lala Retro/ Marula Oil mix on my face, I have some on my hands that hasn‚Äôt been absorbed yet. I usually rub this onto my elbows/ backs of my hands.  üôå It‚Äôs the money factor. In this sub if you post a pic of a ton of DE products (or say, La Mer or any high end products), it can come off like ‚Äúlook how much money I have.‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having money to spend, but in this sub it can sometimes be seen as flaunting wealth. Which is dumb, imo. It‚Äôs a skincare sub. These are skincare products. I really don‚Äôt get the big deal seeing as there are hundreds of drugstore-only shelfies and posts like this offer variety to the sub. It‚Äôs weird to have a sub called skin care addiction and then downvote a shelfie because of the money spent on it lol. Especially when I see so many Sunday Riley posts and everyone seems to live those. I bought what I tested and tried and found to work the best for me. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Before subbing to SCA, I was using apricot scrub and rubbing alcohol for my acne, which makes me cringe now. So even though people might not like my shelfie I still want to thank the sub as a whole for teaching me how to take care of my skin better.  I agree. I use a lot of cheap drug store products, as well as some DE and expensive ones. I use products that work for my skin. Isn‚Äôt that what all of us here are trying to do? Find products that make our skin happy? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Lol for real, it seems like people only upvote shelfies that have mostly TO/CeraVe products. Those are great if they work for you, but if more expensive stuff works for you then I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs a negative thing. I resisted trying Charlotte Tillbury‚Äôs Magic Cream moisturizer because everyone on here said it was overpriced crap. Then I got a sample from Sephora and it‚Äôs literally the best moisturizer I‚Äôve ever tried, period. It‚Äôs expensive but since it worked so well for me I didn‚Äôt mind the price tag. People are dumb. That Vit C is one of my favourites.
Works better on me than most of the expensive brands I've tried. granactive retinoid emulsion is HG status for me!   From left to right: 
The Ordinary Granactive Retinoids 2% Emulsion
The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution
The Ordinary 100% Plant-derived Squalane 
The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Great photo! How long did they take to arrive? I‚Äôve just ordered some! Yeah heard a lot of good things about it, tough choice picking between the 4 vitamin C‚Äôs they have haha Thanks üëåüèª Ordered on Thursday early early morning, was at my door by Friday morning üòÄ How did you choose? I already have a bunch of stuff to try but I'd like to try vitamin C eventually and I'm sort of overwhelmed by the options! [deleted] I took the advice of this article: 

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/beautyeditor.ca/.amp/2017/08/04/the-ordinary

It states reasons why this one is the best option out of the 4 available, and it also was the highest rated and reviewed one on the website I bought it off. I guess it also depends on your skin type as well  Brightens and smooths out skin tone and stops oxidation, I purchased mine from adore beauty which is the official stockist for the Ordinary in Australia   Whats your skin type :0? Combination with oily t zone, acne prone in t-zone I‚Äôm also a DE enthusiast! I must say that the new C tango is AMAZING! I‚Äôve been using it for about 3 weeks and 100% see a difference in brightness and I‚Äôm hoping to see some improvement in the creasing too. 

I see you have a sample of the B hydra, 10/10 would recommend! I love it for day wear because it‚Äôs so light and compliments the C firma well and if you wear makeup it is great underneath. 

The only thing I can‚Äôt get behind is the sunscreen, it feels way too thick and oily for me. The jelly cleanser is amazing at removing makeup and feels great but the PH is a little higher than I want so I use the fresh soy cleanser now!  Sorry, I forgot to post what I have! I apologize for poor formatting. Starting from left to right:

Lala Retro‚Ñ¢ Whipped Cream- very light, doesn't make my skin appear oily. I switch between this and the Maurla oil.

C-Firma‚Ñ¢ Day SerumT.L.C.- Have only been using it for a couple of weeks, but can already notice my skin looking brighter. 

Framboos‚Ñ¢ Glycolic Night Serum- this just arrived in the mail yesterday, so I haven't had a chance to use it yet!

Pekee Bar‚Ñ¢- I alternated between this and the Jelly Cleanser. It isn't harsh and makes my skin feel really clean.

Beste‚Ñ¢ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser- Super light and does a great job at removing makeup!

Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil- I absolutely love using this as an everyday moisturizer. I have very dry skin and this feels amazing on my face.

Umbra Sheer‚Ñ¢ Physical Daily Defense SPF 30- not a huge fan. It is thick and left my skin feeling very oily.

T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial‚Ñ¢- I have only used this once or twice becasue I don't want to overdo it.

Shaba Complex‚Ñ¢ Eye Serum- This also just arrived in the mail yesterday, so I have not had a chance to use it yet! Oh really?! I think it‚Äôs probably my skin type because it doesn‚Äôt have the best reviews. I have very dry skin and when I use this my skin literally glows. It‚Äôs insane! Totally understand how it could be heavy if you had normal/combo/oily though Love the DE sunscreen! Just a tip to you and OP.. if you like and are planning to purchase most of the products in the lineup, it is generally cheaper per ounce to buy the samples rather than full size! The new c tango IS amazing! I‚Äôve only been using it for about a week now, but I can already see a difference! I haven‚Äôt worn makeup in a long time and am curious to see how the b hydra is underneath. 
I have to agree 100% about the sunscreen. I am currently in the market for something lighter and less oily.  I do too actually. I have dry skin so I love how moisturizing it is. People with oily skin should probably tread carefully though.  Really!? I am currently looking for a new sunscreen because this just feels to heavy and oily for my skin. I‚Äôm glad you love it, though!! Awesome! Thank you so much for sharing this with me! I will certainly be doing that, then. I got the sun safety kit from Sephora so I‚Äôve been testing out a few trying to find my HG. So far I really like Tarteguard and Murad invisablur! They‚Äôre only SPF 30 and I would prefer 50 but they feel nice! Josie Maran has a great sunscreen-- SPF 47 and pretty light. Since it's made with argan oil and I get a bit shiny, I would just set it with a loose, sheer powder!  I also hated the DE sunscreen for SO many reasons. I switched to Farmacy's Green Screen, which I'm pretty happy with but I think I want to keep searching. Next on my list is Dr. Gross or Murad, though the Murad is so expensive üò≠ I will have to check that out. I only recently started wearing sunscreen (I know! Yikes!) so, I haven't had the opportunity to try very many. I love the murad and plan to purchase full size! Awesome! Thank you! I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who didn‚Äôt really care for it.  The murad is amazing! Honestly it was terrible. The white cast, the pilling...I wore to to sephora for a foundation match and they matched me two shades lighter than normal. Wow. Ugh I almost wish that wasn't true :( RIP to my wallet! I know, figures I fall in love w ith such a pricey one! Interesting Shelfie! How‚Äôs that kale and spinach moisturizer?   Also how do you like the issa toothbrush? I just got one but so many people say it breaks after a couple months. I plan to go easy on it. Wow! What's your favorite product? I see some shaving products‚Äî recommendations for acne prone and sensitive/dry skin? I LOVE that moisturizer! It‚Äôs a little pricey, but to me it‚Äôs worth every penny. I have Youth to the People‚Äôs cleanser and mask as well. The cleanser is very gentle and doesn‚Äôt strip my skin, but the mask leaves little to be desired. I do like how it doesn‚Äôt dry completely down, though, I just don‚Äôt see any visible results from using it.  Love it! It's super light and the Hyaluronic Acid really helps keep your skin looking good all day. I always seem to go back to it even after using much more expensive products. Good stuff answered above Also, the Keils Avocado Eye Cream is great, it doesn't run into your eyes and you barely have to use any it's so thick Good question... I'm loving the Black Rose Skin Infusion Cream by sisley. (middle shelf, fuchsia jar) It's so incredibly light and smells great.
The Foreo Espada Blue Light Acne Treatment is rad, it totally helps get rid of blemishes by killing the bacteria in the skin with blue light.
The Issa toothbrush is life-changing. I'll never go back to a different toothbrush ever agin. Mine actually broke (the replaceable head fits over a metal stem which broke off) and they sent me a brand new one for free. There is a 2 year warranty  so brush away! I'm a guy with dry, sensitive skin and think hair. Shaving is a whole process to me. 
First thing: don't touch your face. Ever. unless you are washing it or doing your skin care routine. Dirt and bacteria cause breakouts.
Second: Gentle exfoliation everyday. I have a little Foreo Luna (vibrating face scrubber not pictured) that I use religiously every day and night.

Third: 2% Salicylic Acid in your face wash and Paulas Choice Skin Perfecter with 2% SA after your toner. Or some other product with 2% SA. This is an exfoliant that encourages skin cell turnover. 

Fourth: A gentle toner. I make my own but the Keils one in great. It just hydrates your skin before you apply moisturizer.

Fifth: Moisturizer. This is the hard part. I use stuff that keeps water on my skin (humectants) like Hyaluronic Acid, glycerine followed by...

Sixth: Oil finish. Few drops of Argan oil to seal it all in with out clogging my pours.

As far as shaving, I use clean blades after a long shower or bath. Don't thing a few splashes of water is going to do - you need to steam/soak your face. 

Also after I shave I always do a clay mask. My fave is by Philosophy - Purity exfoliating clay mask with salicylic acid and kaolin clay.

Hope that helps! OH Boo!! I have the cleanser and the goji berry oil.  Based on the fact I like both so much I bought the mask.   I was going to try it this weekend!

I noted below but I‚Äôll mention it again. Sephora is giving a deluxe sample set of the cleanser and moisturizer if you spend 35.00 and are a rouge.  Thanks for your reviews.    Thank you!! I‚Äôve been hoarding deluxe samples of the moisturizer so I can give it a go.    I‚Äôm looking forward to using it!!   Sephora is giving a free deluxe sample of the cleanser and moisturizer if you‚Äôre a rouge and buy 35.00 worth of stuff.  I've heard great things about that eye cream from a few people. I may try it sometime. I like Kiehl's. You may love the mask! It‚Äôs really gentle! It‚Äôs just not my cup of tea. Hope you love it! It smells amazing.  Can you include some mini-reviews of your favorites? Shelfies are nice to look at, but don't add much to the sub on their own.

Edit: *crickets* Ooooho√•√• aco face fluid!! Holy grail! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôå  So this is (nearly) my full collection, if you have any questions about anything feel free to ask! Wait, where did u find Paula‚Äôs choice???? I need to know.  Will do!  How do you like Kiehls products? What would you recommend :)? skincity.se :)  I LOVE all the Kiehls products!! I‚Äôve only tried the ones at the picture and i would recommend them all! Probably one of my favorite brands  I can‚Äôt believe no one has beat me to this joke... but you can‚Äôt afford a shelf, because of all of the DE products, right? üòÇ

In all seriousness, though, enjoy treating yourself! Most of us do in one way or the other. We just choose different things. If you like the Marula Oil, Acure and Ordinary make cheaper dupes. I love Drunk Elephant but $72 for 30ml is too much for my wallet. Sukari Baby Facial on the other hand has been worth every single penny. [deleted] What‚Äôs your routine with all of them? Babyfacial and Framboos, along with their c firma, has done absolute wonders for my skin. They faded my not so cute freckles, and just make my makeup sit so much more nicely. 

I do not like their Marula oil, or their moisturizers, besides protini. Basically I love everything in their acid trip kit (when it‚Äôs in stock which is rarely)  Wealth! ü§ë Nice OP! I'm really surprised and honestly disappointed at a few of the shady comments you've received about buying expensive skincare.  I'm 22 and a full-time student but I have a bunch of DE, Sunday Riley, and other upscale products because skincare's a big hobby of mine and I like spending my disposable income on it. If your shelfie was composed of all TO products I doubt anyone would be being rude lol.  

How long have you been using the whole line? I have the Protini and Lala and love them, but didn't care for the Vit. C. [removed] Oh wow! That‚Äôs my dream shelf right there. Did you buy everything full price or did you get anything on sale? I‚Äôm really curious about the TLC Framboos and C-Firma. lol! my bathroom just doesn‚Äôt have a shelf near the mirror, sacrificed it for the counter space  True, I‚Äôve heard of TO‚Äôs marula oil. Did you use DE‚Äôs before using TO‚Äôs?  yes i do! all their products are so complementary to each other and now that i have their moisturizers i‚Äôm really seeing better results :) Haven‚Äôt used the Beste cleanser yet but depending on my skins needs I usually wash with Pekee for a quick cleanse or Juju if I need to exfoliate (AM/PM). 

Then, AM: C firma + B hydra, then Protini mixed with Umbra and a a little bit more of B hydra to moisturize 

Or if it‚Äôs PM: Framboos, which I don‚Äôt like to mix it with my moisturizer just to ensure that i‚Äôm getting the full effect of it despite DE saying you can, idk i‚Äôm iffy! Then I follow up by mixing Lala, Protini, some B hydra, and a drop of Marula oil :) 

My key is a moisturizer DE cocktail, lol!  How long did it take for your freckles fade?  Nope!! Im literally 18, in college college, have a part time job and I live with my parents so no bills to pay.  Thank YOU! Having this doesn‚Äôt make me ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù or ‚Äúrich‚Äù or ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù.... Some people, smh! I haven‚Äôt tried sunday riley, DE makes it so that you use strictly their products so now I‚Äôm kinda scared to try new things since my skin is in a good place. Nope!! Im literally 18, in college college, have a part time job and I live with my parents so no bills to pay. And I pay for every skincare, makeup, and clothing item I have :)  [deleted] *Everything on sale! 15% off hahah. If i didn‚Äôt have that, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten all of it. Framboos is the best for me! C-Firma, honestly not sure if I notice a huge difference but I don‚Äôt mind repurchasing since I only do get the travel size since it tends to oxidize quicker  I bought the night bright duo of Drunk Elephant littles, then bought the $12 bottle of Acure Marula Oil from Target. Tested them side by side. Identical stuff. They have faded 50% in a month! I have all over freckles not cute little ones splattered on my nose and cheeks and just never really liked them. But even more exciting, my skin just looks and feels so smooth. I was always a physical exfoliater until I found this sub, and what a difference it makes to use a chemical one!  Lol, that‚Äôs wealth to me! Disposable income to spend on ALL THE DRUNK ELEPHANT.  What is college college? I second this op :) ! I‚Äôm a college student too and I think it‚Äôs great that you use your own money to fund your hobbies. I shamefully use my parents because I can‚Äôt juggle school and work...

Would you tell me how you feel about framboos vs baby facial? I have framboos and recently tried a sample of babyfacial and I love it so much. I‚Äôm itching to buy it but I already have both aha and bha in my routine :(   [removed] Nice! Thanks for the feedback. I think I‚Äôll start with the trial size kits that Sephora offers and see how they work. really? have you been using framboos daily and babyfacial twice a week? I feel like i may be using babyfacial wrong, idk... i‚Äôm not seeing *amazing* results perks of living with your parents, and it‚Äôs socially acceptable to at 18üòâ  we all do what we want with our money  aww whatever u think it means  Right! I think people shouldn't be judgmental whether its someones money or their parents. DE says that Babyfacial is an added AHA/BHA boost once a week. For me Babyfacial hasn't been anything spectacular and I've used it for a month now, and there was only one random use of it where I saw a really nice difference, which is weird because so many people LOVE Babyfacial so I feel like I may be using it wrong? :( Idk! TLC Framboos is something to die for and I'd repurchase it any day!!  yup, we all do. i sure am ‚Äúrolling in it‚Äù while getting paid less than $10/hr and making it work, without a credit card. i‚Äôm not someone who gets my parents to pay for the things i want is what i was getting at.  Are you using a vitamin C serum? Since I‚Äôve started all three of those things at once, I‚Äôm not sure which one, or if it‚Äôs a combination of the three, that does the most for me.  ME TOO! The first two times I tried baby facial I didn‚Äôt notice a difference  but during my third time, it seriously smoothed out my texture issues and I became obsessed. Maybe I‚Äôll keep using samples to see if it was a fluke. Thank you!! :D  Yup using them all, and protini! Well, I started C Firma on May 12 so hasn‚Äôt been a complete month yet, Maybe my scars are a lot more darker so it‚Äôll take more time üòï **Hi everyone!

I still have terrible texture and bumps on my chin though and am

1. unsure if these are black heads? large sebaceous filaments, acne scars or some mixture of those   
and
2. what products to use to tackle this issue.

[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/5ax1mwD) (note: I am wearing a light foundation)

Any tips on my routine or lasting issue?

<3 Wow it‚Äôs almost like you love The Ordinary üòâüòÇ I don‚Äôt understand your PM routine completely. Do you use 2 exfoliations at a time? Can you please write what you will today and what you did yesterday or you will do tomorrow? Also I personally put my Retinol with Squalane last when I use it, because I see it as an oil product. Skin type & concerns:  
My skin is on the dryer side, lots of redness, large pores, poor texture.  
I use to have terrible acne but it has calmed over the years to just occasional break outs and some bumps (not quite white heads..  just.. weird acne bumps). I did some research after reading this fully. Apparently sebaceous filaments don‚Äôt have any texture. My nose has a lot of these- I‚Äôve always wondered why my nose pores look like they have darkened fillings, but they aren‚Äôt black heads. Apparently I should be using a chemical peel, so thanks for this! 

Are the spots raised? Do they hurt? Do they look like the fillings are darker for sure? I had problems with cystic acne when I was younger, and I couldn‚Äôt get it to go away for anything, except when I went to the dermatologist and got put on accutane. 

Also. Google milia. Let me know if it‚Äôs anything like that. 

Do you drink a lot of kombucha by any chance? I had REALLY BAD fungal acne when I was drinking a lot of kombucha. Then I stopped drinking it. Poof, gone.

I also noticed a huge improvement in my skin‚Äôs texture when I started taking collagen pills. I take the Up+Up Target Brand Collagen & Vitamin C pills. I also noticed a huge difference in my skin with an overnight mask.

One thing though- do you have oily skin? Because if you‚Äôre using any creams instead of gels, it can clog pores.

I‚Äôm also really surprised that you‚Äôre not using a heavy duty moisturizer at night. Night is when your body is trying to repair your skin while you sleep. I have oily skin and I use Dr. Brandt Hydrobiotic. It has made my skin super smooth. You would probably really benefit from a moisture overnight mask Can you post a picture without makeup?

For texture I recommend Tretinoin. It's much more effective than Retinol. We be broke out here, and the simplicity of the products make them easy to research. No. Never two exfoliants at a time.
Most nights I just use the cleanser.
Twice a week I use the peeling gel exfoliant instead of the cleanser. 

Every two weeks I use the AHA/BHA peeling solution, when I use this product I usually just wash with water beforehand. 
The irish moor mud is really hardly ever used anymore, I probably shouldn't have included it. 

Noted about the retinol oil! There‚Äôs a huge chance you might be allergic to something you‚Äôre using and that these are actually hives The dark stuff on your noses could maybe be oxidated tallow I'm familiar with the sebaceous filaments on the nose (I have the same), the pores on my chin do look similar with the darkened fillings but some of them also look raised and maybe with a lighter filling. (blackheads?)  


I use to have bad acne and I wonder if its a mixture of blackheads and scars?

They do not hurt at all and don't seem like cystic acne unless its a super super mild version of cystic acne?  

They definitely don't look like milia, not as prominent at all. 

Okay, so I do not drink kombucha \*but\* (I have never thought of this before)... I do also have Tinea Versicolor which is a mild chronic fungal infection of the skin. It mainly only appears on my torso; stomach/chest area, and near my genitals..(pretty much areas that don't get as much sunlight) it looks like red blotches.... so the fungal idea is interesting but the tinea versicolor blotchiness has never shown itself on my face and is not what this looks like. 

\*Collagen pills noted.  


I have mostly dryer skin although it probably is truly combination. I could see my chin being a little more oily, but I also often am dry around the creases of my mouth and on my cheeks. I am really picky with my moisturizers. I‚Äôm at work so can‚Äôt post a make up less picture until tomorrow.

I don‚Äôt even use my retinol on my chin for texture, should I be? I just put it in my forehead wrinkles. 

Should I put using it (or the tretinoin) everywhere? That‚Äôs good to hear I've had this texture forever, I don't think its an allergy issue. (I have also broken out from an allergic reaction and it doesn't feel anything like that). I tried the TO Niacnamide and I don‚Äôt get on well with it, red bumps and itchy skin. I read it multiple times here that other people also experience that. OP could that be for you as well? Absolutely!! Tretinoin is the absolute gold standard topical for literally every skin condition; acne, texture, lines, wrinkles, pigmentation, etc. Gotcha! I got really weird bumps from using a product one time, and they weren‚Äôt itching or anything, but they weren‚Äôt zits. When I stopped using that product, they went away. This is definitely not my experience. I've had this poor chin texture issue for long, long before I started using Niacinamide, and have not seen any added issues since I started using it.

Thanks for the check in though! It is the same as retinol-a? I think my partner has some. 

I imagine I might want to eliminate much of my current skin care routine if I were to give it a go? Definitely eliminate the Glycolic toner, the chemical peel and the exfoliating cleanser. Focus on moisture and sun protection. I'm not sure if Retinol A is the same thing.. is it a prescription? Tretinoin is prescription only in most countries. I think it is a prescription but I‚Äôll double check and do research before jumping in.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I think it's under rated too. Their moisturisers are light and unscented. They are cheap too : ) too much fragrance in most of their products, but their Olay Complete All Day Sensitive Skin SPF 30 is a HG. I love Olay Complete moisturizer. I have used it for years. I currently have oily dehydrated skin caused by harsh products that damaged my skin barrier.  My goal is to get rid of my dehydrated fine lines and get back to a balanced normal skin complexion

AM: 

    - 7 in one foaming cleanser for cleansing my skin without leaving it parched

    - deep hydration serum for drawing moisture to my skin

    - complete spf moisturizer for sealing in all the moisture and provide light UV protection

PM:

    - daily facials cloths for getting the spf off without drying my skin

    - micro-sculpting super essence water for prepping my skin to absorb the retinol serum

    - retinol 24 serum for gentle exfoliation and fine lines

    - total effects 7 in one  moisturizer for sealing all the moisture I added to my skin

*** the cleanse toner and pore perfecting vitamin c scrub are used when needed about 1-2 times a week for when my skin feels extra congested

Reviews: 

    - 7 in one foaming cleanser is gentle and leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist

    - deep hydration serum is light, airy, and hydrating

    - complete spf moisturizer  goes on with the slightest white cast that oxidizes to a glowy sheen, doesn‚Äôt break me out or feel too heavy

    - daily facials cloths break down any gunk on my face easily and gently , super foamy so I cut cloth in half 

    - micro-sculpting super essence water keeps my pores open and the moisture on skin long enough for me to add serum

    - retinol 24 serum is hydrating and light but the retinol strength seems very diluted 

    - total effects 7 in one  moisturizer is airy and light , have to add in layers or else eraser shavings effect happens

    - the cleanse toner works well when used once in a while when skin is very congested and oily but too harsh and drying for daily use, won‚Äôt purchase again 

    - pore perfecting vitamin c scrub isn‚Äôt bad but isn‚Äôt notable , it gets the basic job done, won‚Äôt buy again


¬†I was under the impression that Olay was an old lady skincare line since my mom used it . Then I finally tried it for myself and began buying one product after the other. My goal is to try all of their products . Overall, this is a great drug store line in my opinion. I think I‚Äôm about 60-70% almost to a normal balanced skin barrier. I see myself using Olay skincare for the long term.

Anyone else try Olay? Thoughts, critiques, questions, and comments are welcome!  Also, sorry for any format issues. I‚Äôm a newbie to SCA. I‚Äôm noticing the trend with what‚Äôs popular. I bought Cerave yesterday, so I can hop on the wagon. Haul/Shelfie

I‚Äôm a 23 year old female and my skin type is combination, oily T-zone and dry around my mouth area. I do double cleansing with an oil cleanser and followed by a gel and/or foam cleanser. My skin usually has some light acne but my main issue is acne scarring and blackheads. This is my current routine, but please let me know if there are any recommendations for produts you think might work better!

*Mini-review time!*

**Botanics 3 in 1 Micellar Cleanser Hydration Burst w/ Clary Sage (\~8 USD)**: I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. It‚Äôs super light, does not irritate the skin and does not have a fragrance. Makes my face feel a bit cleaner without stripping it. I usually start my routine with this one, morning or night because I like to wipe off the previous routine and let the oil, gel and foam cleansers do the real work. Will buy again.

**Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser (\~12 USD)**: I like this cleanser. It‚Äôs very gentle, doesn‚Äôt have a fragrance and does the job of cleaning my face but not making it super dry. I use it only in the morning and will buy again.

**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Light Cleansing Oil (\~14 USD)**: I use this oil cleanser when I wear makeup because I feel like it does a great job of removing the rest of the makeup off of my face after the micellar water. It is light and melts into the face, helping take the products right off the face. I really like how simple and affordable it is to use and will probably buy it again.

**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Foaming Cleanser (\~10)**: I use this after the oil cleanser of the same name and it is a pretty great follow up. The fragrance is light and the foam is not irritating to the face. Does the job of finishing the cleansing job. I use it exclusively for makeup since I think it works pretty well so I will probably buy the duo again.

**Banila Clean IT Zero Cleansing Balm Original (\~17 USD)**: This is current skin lover trendy product so I really wanted to give it a shot. I currently use it on the days that I don‚Äôt wear makeup and I do like how it applies smoothly and melts into the skin. It isn‚Äôt as messy as my Face Shop oil cleanser since it's a balm and not an oil. It is easy to use and doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin. I‚Äôve been using it for about a month and tbh, if I don‚Äôt see any major changes, I probably will NOT buy again because I think my Face Shop oil cleanser does just as good of a job. It just doesn‚Äôt rock my world like I had anticipated.

**Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Cleanser (\~13)**: I am big fan of gentle cleansers so this one is a go-to for my nightly routine where I don‚Äôt wear makeup. It does a pretty good job at removing the rest of the dirt and grime from my face and when I use it, I can literally feel the bumps under my skin rising to the surface without wrecking my face. It works like a light purge, in my opinion, and kinda seems to try to extract acne one blemish at a time. I like it a lot and will probably buy again.

**Skinfood Black Sugar Honey Washoff Mask (once a week) (\~10 USD)**: This mask is so nice! It smells DELICIOUS enough to eat, but please don‚Äôt haha. It works as a great exfoliating mask and makes my skin feel SO SOFT. It feels good exfoliating with it and my pores do look notably cleaner after each use. I‚Äôve been using it for over a year and it is one of my faves that stay on my shelf, no matter what. WILL buy again.

**Soap & Glory The Fab Pore 2-EN-1 Masque & Peeling (\~11 USD) (once a week):** I just started using this fairly recently and I really like it. It applies smoothly, smells kinda minty, and penetrates into the pores. It doesn‚Äôt really ‚Äòpeel‚Äô, but does work to get rid of the unwelcome visitors in your pores. Skin feels good after each use and not too stripped away so as long as I don‚Äôt develop any weird reactions, I probably will buy again.

**Innisfree Green Tea Balancing Skin EX Toner (\~15 USD):** I started using this after the Thayer‚Äôs Witchhazel with Aloe Vera wasn‚Äôt working and made my skin sting. This toner is the complete opposite. It‚Äôs kind milky in consistency and I usually spread and gently pat it around my face. It is light and pretty moisturizing for a toner. I like how my face feels with it so I will probably buy it again.

**Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (\~21 USD):** So this one is complicated. I really like the feel and consistency of this, it‚Äôs kinda sticky and slimy in a way you‚Äôd expect snail essence to be. I use it at night and DO feel like it helps hydrate my face and calm down my acne. However, I used to use it twice a day and didn‚Äôt really feel like it did much so when I changed to using it only in the morning, I felt it worked better for my skin without using as much product. If it‚Äôs still working like how it is by the time it‚Äôs run out, I will buy again.

**Botanics Hydrating Eye Cream (\~20 USD)**: I use this cream twice a day and honestly, I don‚Äôt really like it. While it is light and not greasy to wear, I feel like it doesn‚Äôt do much for my bags under my eyes. It‚Äôs supposed to be hydrating, and it is, but I just feel like ‚Äòvisually‚Äô, it didn‚Äôt do much for me. Once I‚Äôm done with it, I will NOT buy again.

**Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drops Pure Vitamin C Serum (\~23 USD)**: I use this at night and at first, I really didn‚Äôt see the hype. Like really. I used it every night for like 2 weeks and didn‚Äôt see a change. But, after a little more than a month of using it, I feel like it really started evening out the tone of my skin with the acne scars fading. Now, it is a favorite. I can‚Äôt wait to see how my skin looks after month two! It looks like it will last a while since you apply it in drops so I have quite a while to go before it‚Äôs done. If I still love it by then, then I‚Äôll definitely buy again, but if not, I‚Äôll move on to the the Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum.

**Innisfree Green Tea Balancing Lotion EX (\~18 USD)**: I bought this in a set with the toner and I really like it! It‚Äôs really light and does not make my face feel caked with moisturizer, like how hydrating moisturizers tend to do. A little goes a long way and it fits nicely under my sunscreen and makeup. Will buy again!

**Dr. Jart Every SunDay Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 50+/PA++++ (\~26 USD)**: I use this every morning and it is a pretty great product for me. It smells like sunscreen and goes on smoothly. It isn‚Äôt too heavy and a nice thin layer seems to do the job for me. It is a bit pricer than I am used to spending so if I find a better and cheaper alternative, then I WON‚ÄôT buy again. But that also might be because I am interested in Klair‚Äôs Soft Airy UV Essence¬†**SPF**¬†50 PA++++¬†haha. Asian skincare is life!! I love the innisfree black sugar mask Looking good! Thanks so much for writing out awesome reviews for each product. 

What would you say has helped the most with your acne? Thanks for the comment!

I would say that the products that have been most helpful for my acne are: Cosrx Saylic Cleanser (bringing acne out and clearing it), Klairs Juiced Vitamin Drops (aging acne and fading scars) and the Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin Power essence (calming down acne, less redness). The rest of my products focus on mousture and gently treating my face as a whole. 

Hope this helped! I first misread the title as you restocking the CeraVe cream and I was like ‚Äúhas anyone on this earth ever actually finished a tub???‚Äù üò© I'm currently using the foaming facial cleanser and I'm wondering if anyone likes this one better? Is it more hydrating? The foaming one also has HA but is there more in this one?

Also I love the wine glass in the background, lol. I use those too! The cream took a little bit getting used to cause I wasn‚Äôt used to thicker face lotions, but I love it now.  Ok so I too just bought the CeraVe Cream in the tub and I have never been happier with a cream in my life. I want to bathe in this stuff. It‚Äôs so *soft*! I just want to dip my grimy hands into that tub every time I walk past it! Still patch testing and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll emotionally handle it if this doesn‚Äôt work out.  [deleted] Oh I envy you. I moved back home and now I cant get one in my country. I loved this wash.  loveeee this moisturizer. Wasn't a fan of it at first because I felt like it just sunk into my skin but kept using it due to it not causing breakouts. Wow my skin is soooo soft like a baby's butt. I do the layering technique at night and put about three layers of it and my skin is so soft when I rinse it in the morning. 
I'm currently using Vanicream as my face wash but I may try this wash after my vanicream runs out (which will be in like two years-- its lasting me such a long time) I think I'm missing something...it's a picture of two CeraVe products? Is there a difference between the big tub and the little little jar?  Oh man, I bet they are the same. Where do I go to find the ingredients and compare? The product names are listed above! 

The cleanser has worked wonders for my skin since I first bought it a few months ago! My skin has never been TOO bad, but I tend to have recurring acne and dryness on my chin & t-zone. With this cleanser, my skin has been very clear & hydrated and feels super soft after cleansing.

Will list a mini review of the moisturizer when I‚Äôve had chances to try it.  i use it as a body lotion so i go through it semi-frequently lol  Hahaha these things are ridonc. I picked it up and felt like I was picking up a weight lol!! I use it as my body lotion (whenever I infrequently moisturize my bod) so I‚Äôve finished one tub after almost a year of use  haha, i've actually gone through 2 tubs in maybe...2 years? i use it only on my face and not as a body lotion.  I‚Äôve heard the foaming is great! I‚Äôm not big on foaming washes though bc they‚Äôve always made my skin feel dry (given, I never tried the CeraVe kind). I like this formula a lot, I have dry patches on my skin in T-zone & chin and am oily around the eyes, and this cleanser really evens it all out. Not sure about HA amount in this one. 

And lol ya girl be cleansin‚Äô her face AND gettin her wine on all day every day It does feel quite thick, but it seems to absorb into the skin quickly so I don‚Äôt think I can pay too much mind to it!  It feels great so far! Also ok this thing is like almost an entire pound of product and I really don‚Äôt even need that much... i‚Äôm amazed I got it last week and I didn't even bother with patch testing (I never do, shame on me) and just slathered it on. Love it. Sure it could be a bit more hydrating and less siliconey but I'm fine with it. A few drops of squalane before and I'm good to go.  I‚Äôm really excited to try it! It‚Äôs a little heavy at first, but seems to blend well into the skin. Have you tried the Simple moisturizer? And if so, how would you compare the two? Sorry to hear that! Is something in it not allowed in your country or just not accessible? Because if it‚Äôs not illegal and you have access to Amazon, Amazon sells it! Might be a bit expensive to ship, but Amazon is usually great about international shipping prices, in my experience That‚Äôs a good idea, it‚Äôs thick enough Right? It‚Äôs so cost effective. I‚Äôm going to use it on my body too so it at least gets used up before it expires. I‚Äôm thinking about decanting it into smaller batches  too just so I don‚Äôt have to keep opening the big jar while possibly introducing bacteria each time.  **Hi everyone!

Thank you! Meow! Looks beautiful.  Enjoy! Your setup display is so soothing to look at. Very pleasing to the eye! This woukd calm me if it was one of the 1st things I saw everyday. I have switched over to a 100% Drunk Elephant routine after being obsessive over trying out every product and needing every new thing that has hit the shelves. I became Sephora rouge very quickly. I realized too late that this was stupid and so unhealthy for my skin not to be consistent. 

‚†Ä
I have always been dry and have battled severe acne since I was 14 (11 years). It wasn‚Äôt until I had failed using antibiotics that ruined my skin when I went off of them,  that simply glycolic acid, major moisture and no birth control was my answer! 


This brand was my first real dive into non-drugstore skincare and I loved it so much at first since it took the bad acne away and then simply got bored. I‚Äôm on a mission now to stick with my routine and finally clear up my skin for good!

‚†Ä
AM:
Slaai cleanser (melts my makeup so perfectly) 
C firma and b hydra serum mixed ( has brighten my hyperpigmentation and increased hydration! They work so much better since the texture is smoother when applied together) 
Marula oil ( four drops is all you need and it‚Äôs a light formula that won‚Äôt clog pores) 
C tango eye cream ( on my second one and it really has lightened up my under eyes ) 
Protini moisturizer (lots of hydration but still light enough for layers of sunscreen and makeup afterwards) 
Umbra tinte sunscreen (this is thick and greasy if not really massaged in - but has 20% zinc oxide! 

‚†Ä
PM:
Slaai cleanser
Bestie no 9 cleanser
TLC Framboos serum ( my holy grail, totally cleared up my acne and I do a pump every other night! ) or A Passioni retinol (this one is still new to me, but my skin has become significantly flatter since I started - I started slow as it‚Äôs pretty strong at just twice a week) 
Marula oil 
Shaba eye serum (this is okay, it‚Äôs very lightweight and hydrated but not much else, just using it up) 
Lala retro moisturizer (this saves my skin in the winter for how moisturizing and soothing it is) 

‚†Ä
Babyfacial mask once a week - I truly feel baby soft and take it easy with only 15 min, it‚Äôs strong and so many people use it incorrectly. I use d Bronzi mixed with my primer for an added glow which I love under foundation and I have a couple of the Lippe balm I stash to keep my lips soft ( so many lip balms give me pimples but this one doesn‚Äôt) 


‚†Ä
I‚Äôm posting here mainly to motivate myself to keep with it and continue to see results!


So far my skin is softer than ever. The tiny little bumps have smoothed out and my skin plumped out with the hydration. I have surprisingly send my hyperpigmentation lighten up a smidge and I have only have 1 pimple that I think was from a lip gloss. I think protini, TLC Framboos and c firma are the big hitters in this routine!!


‚†Ä
Wish me luck :)

Edit: sorry I missed some info. I‚Äôm totally new here!! I am religious with my routine and generally do as the packaging says. I also added mini reviews. I‚Äôm so sorry for my formatting, mobile user I used to be too, but trial and error made me realize it works for me! How is this different than when people post The Ordinary shelfies? I‚Äôm just sharing what I genuinely love cause I love this subreddit and wanted to be included You just made my day :) thank you!! It‚Äôs boujie, but skincare brings me so much joy and it was a journey to find what works! The brand doesn't have a great reputation? I got a sample of their Framboos Glycolic night serum, and I really really liked it‚Äîbut could never justify almost $100 for the full size! Tbh I‚Äôm finding really similar results with my TO serums. 

There is literally no reason for the prices to be THAT high, and a lot of their marketing is fear mongering (no silicones or physical sunscreens!) that spreads misinformation about skincare.

At one point I had serious DE envy, but I‚Äôm over it now. Their packaging is cute as a button and yeah their products are good, but there‚Äôs other stuff out there just as good or better for a tiny fraction of the price. I have truly hated every product I ever bought from them. There was just a thread about it on r/muacjdiscussion, but the face wash was so drying and irritating it flared up an eczema problem on my cheeks I haven‚Äôt had since I was a child, and I would compare the proteni moisturizer to dollar general brand face lotion. The D-Bronzi doesn‚Äôt do anything except make you look weirdly tinted and sparkling. The baby facial destroyed my skin and it took me weeks to heal it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend any product of theirs at all and on top of that they‚Äôre SO insanely expensive for no reason. I honestly believe everyone‚Äôs skin is different. I literally hadn‚Äôt found something that worked until I tried this stuff. I used cerave/cetaphil/spectrojel for years since it was all that was recommended and none of it did anything. I think for my skin in particular, I needed the high concentration of glycolic in the Framboos to clear up my acne and it‚Äôs been essentially clear for a year. 

I‚Äôm glad you love the packaging like I do! Edited! Thank you! It‚Äôs been kind to me :) Awe thank you so much! I love a pretty white vanity and colourful products :) Dude. This ad could not be more transparent. See? That means everything! Finding joy in something simple like a skincare routine can be life changing. Extra points because of how pretty it all looks on your shelf/counter! My bad Yeah I love the colorful lids! I‚Äôm so sorry it comes across this way! Please tell me what I could have done better. I would never post a paid review. I‚Äôve never felt so crappy about sharing something I genuinely live Thank you again you kind soul! I take pictures of my skincare for Instagram too and it‚Äôs such a fun hobby! I love talking skincare and taking photos and everything. Everyone has to have their ‚Äúthing‚Äù to enjoy! In that case I feel bad you‚Äôre getting dumped on. We‚Äôre all obviously pretty cynical about certain types of covert advertising and some innocent posts are bound to get thrown on the bonfire, which really sucks. 

If it works for you and you love it then that‚Äôs awesome, and it‚Äôs undeniably aesthetically pleasing to look at! The reason it set off the alarm bells is for a few different reasons: pretty new account without a lot of posts or comments, products are all from one brand which is sort of unusual around here, and the pic looks so nice it could be used as an actual ad. Obviously none of that is your fault, I hope you aren‚Äôt too discouraged from posting in the future, I‚Äôm sorry about this bad experience! Couldn‚Äôt agree moreüíú‚ú® You‚Äôre so kind for your response. I totally get it now, being a newbie I haven‚Äôt thought of these things or notices them. I‚Äôm used to the Instagram community as I post skincare on my page and I love taking photos. I really appreciate your words and hope you‚Äôre having a lovely day!! **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I don‚Äôt understand and can‚Äôt even begin to understand this routine... ü§¶üèª How is the acwell toner working for u? Posting my routine in case anyone‚Äôs interested! 

1. Skin-type/concerns: acne prone (mild-moderate, cheek and jaw area primarily). Also sensitive and easily flamed, peeling is a big concern for me, as is aging.

1. Full routine is pictured with numbers for the order. I use all twice daily except for the below:

Only in the AM: 
Misumi All-Day Moisturizer with SPF 30
Missha/La Mer BB Creams (I mix these together to get the right color and coverage.)

Only in the PM: Tretinoin .1% Cream
Sunday Riley LUNA Sleeping Night Oil (I use on areas of my face that I do NOT use Tretinoin Cream, such as tear trough and nose)

Product Reviews: 
1. Hanskin Pore Cleansing Oil *it‚Äôs alright. Works well enough but leaves oily residue so I prefer Banila‚Äôs Clean It ZERO Cleansing Balm
2. Mamonde Petal Spa Oil To Foam *I love this and plan to order it with my next haul. It smells amazing and really gets all the makeup or product off.
3. Misumi AHA 10% Skin Perfecting Cleanser *I started using this along with the other two Misumi products two weeks ago. My skin has improved since then, the cleanser is a clear blue and stings a little but feels very effective and leaves skin calm.
4. Acwell Licorice PH Balancing Essence Mist *This is refreshing and hydrating. I like that it‚Äôs a spray so I don‚Äôt waste Essence on tissues or cotton balls.
5. Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion 1% *I like that this is non-drying, I avoided using an antibiotic gel because they have been drying when I used them in the past. I‚Äôm not sure this is the best topical antibiotic but it‚Äôs pretty good. I‚Äôd love suggestions on other topical antibiotics though! 
6. Enhanced Lotion 10% Glycolic AHA *Besides the terrible smell, which is kind of sulfur-esque, 
this is an amazing product, especially for the price. It stings a little but is very rich and calming and fades redness nicely by morning if left on overnight.
7. Neogen Real Vitamin C Powder Lemon *I love this product! I mix a slightly more than pea-size amount into either the Clindamycin lotion or occasionally Tretinoin cream (this is very harsh so I only do this once in a while, and the powder is pretty strong/ very effective at lightening any discoloration)
8. Tretinoin Cream .1% *Strongest formula available (where I life in the US, anyway!) I started with .05% after a couple of courses of Accutane, which maintains things pretty well. Very irritating if overused, I now use it nightly but if I‚Äôm too irritated, I mix it into a moisturizer, such as this night mask:
9. Aveda Tulasara Wedding Masque *So rich and moisturizing! 
10. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream *Good for balancing irritated skin, very rich
11. Sunday Riley LUNA Sleeping Night Oil *One of my favorite products, smells very strong and botanical, have used on more sensitive and non-acne prone areas of my face for years. Skin is very dewy in the morning from this one but it‚Äôs pricey ($105 for the bottle in the pic) ‚Äî this has lasted me nearly two years.  Love this brand!
12. Misumi Wrinkle-Free All Day Moisturizer SPF 30 *very calming, doesn‚Äôt absorb very quickly so needs a little time before I can put on the next layers. Bottle is small but I just use a little.
13. Aquaphor *Miracle product! Since it‚Äôs an occlusive, it seals in whatever is already under it and keeps everything on my skin in place/ sort of freezes my skin where it is while I go about the day or sleep. Minimizes peeling and dryness so I don‚Äôt end up with a fully flaking face a few hours after putting makeup on. Basically works as a primer and gives that dewy look
14. Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 No. *I use this to cover where needed, which is why I don‚Äôt rely on it for 100% of my SPF coverage. It‚Äôs a very pale and cool color, light coverage but enough for a regular day. Keeps skin calm but isn‚Äôt the best as makeup.. easily comes off in clumps iff you touch your face at all. 
15. La Mer the reparative skin tint Broad Spectrum SPF  30. *Thicker formula than Missha‚Äôs, more pigmented too. Color is just a little too orange for me which is why I mix them. 
16. Tatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Mist *LOVE this! Actually makes skin look dewy and hydrated, feels amazing as it‚Äôs a very fine mist, and sort of seals in makeup under a finish that feels a little healthier-looking than a matte finishing spray. 
17. Elensilia-CPP Collagen 80 Intensive Eye Cream *I don‚Äôt know if I actually believe much in the effectiveness in eye creams. This keeps my eye area calm and hydrated, but I think I‚Äôd need fillers to actually have real results w/ plumping, lightening etc. This one‚Äôs a thick sort of yellow gel that squeezes in a thin line. Lasts a while.

 *I mix Clindamycin 1% lotion 3-4x per week with an equal amount of Neogen Vitamin C Powder.
*I just started mixing 3 parts Aveda Wedding Masque with 1 part Tretinoin .1% Cream at night due to irritation from using Tret undiluted. 
*I use either Tretinoin OR AHA 10% lotion, not both at once. It‚Äôs soothing but very liquid and so application isn‚Äôt ideal because I end up needing to rub it in. I like the essence from the Dr. Althea Herb Therapy Sheet Mask  better if I really need a dose of essence, it‚Äôs thicker and I just like sheet masks Wow, your skin looks great! Doubt I could handle all those actives along with tret, but it just proves that skin is really different from person to person! 

Just so you know, when you reply to automod other users don't see your comment easily, so some people might be missing out on your reviews! Oh thank you, I had no idea! Newish to Reddit haha. My skin is probably extra resilient after going through 2 rounds of Accutane, keeping it clear takes a lot of actives usually but once and a while I just need a night of moisturizer and Aquaphor to recover **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Make sure to patch test! Keep us posted! Lactic acid AND retinol? my skin hurts seeing those together This looks HEAVENLY, tell us how it goes! I have combination skin with CCs and melasma. I‚Äôm graduating from 0.5% retinol to 1% and from Mandelic acid to Lactic. Can‚Äôt wait to try the hair serum! Also wanted to see if I liked the Hemi-Squalane better than regular squalane. 

Routine
AM
Squalane cleanser, cerave foaming cleanser, Thayer‚Äôs toner, Mandelic acid followed by Marine Hyaluronics then Niacinamide and Squalane oil then Riversol sunblock 

PM
Glycolic toner
Marine Hyaluronics 
Retinol
Rosehip seed oil Not together! But I have Teflon skin Beware of overexfoliation. You're using 3 products that speed cell turnover daily and upping the intensity of 2 of them. I don‚Äôt think using glycolic acid and retinol in the same routine is a good idea! Ah, that helps! I think you‚Äôre right! Tonight I opted to use Buffet instead as a first step. Hi! Long time lurker, first time poster :) 
I have dry skin (i think) that gets oily in some places sometimes. Lots of redness but minimal acne. 
a.m. routine- wash with water, cerave moisturizing cream (in the tub), then coppertone clearly sheer. 
p.m.- wash with basics soap bar, x2 a week exfoliate with ponds rejuveness anti wrinkle cream, a mixture of rose water and witch hazel for toner, then the cerave facial moisturizing lotion. 
also pictured: clearasil vanishing acne treatment (as spot treatment for zits) and masqueology wild rose hydro gel goldmask (idk how well this works, i've just started doing face masks twice a week)  I would highly recommend the dermal sheet masks from amazon for someone who just started using masks. Super hydrating & cheap enough for every day use. Super gentle. I just used that masqueology mask the other day Thanks! Ive been looking for cheaper ones to buy in bulk <3 **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I'm a 22 year old with acne prone oily skin and when I was a kid, I used to use Innisfree, a Korean drug store-mid level brand since I'm from Korea but it wasn't doing it for me so I decided to change to Kiehl, honestly because I liked their aesthetics and it changed my skincare game. While these items may be expensive, they are extremely effective if you have skin concerns similar/same to mine. I keep all my products except the cleanser in my skincare cabinet in my dresser as to keep it relatively cool and to avoid exposure from sunlight. 

My AM and PM routines are the same except for maybe masks at night during weekends. 

1. I start with Kiehl's blue herbal acne cleanser. It's not in the photo since it's in my bathroom. Sorry. It's a cleansing cream with salicylic acid. It's not harsh or drying but is soothing and cool to your face as you rub it in and washes off with zero effort and doesn't leave any films on the face. 
2. Then I go on with my Blue astringent herbal lotion, the big blue bottle in front. I don't know why it's labelled as a lotion even though it's a toner. It's an astringent so it has alcohol and this is the only product with alcohol that I use in my routine because it really removes any leftover dirt and sets a nice base for other products to be absorbed. I put dab it on my cotton pad and massage it all over. 
3. Then I immediately move onto Calendula herbal-extract toner alcohol-free. It complements perfectly with the astringent since it's an alcohol free gentle hydrating toner. It's actually got calendula leaves inside so you can leave them on troubled spots for further impact. Again, cotton pads. 
4. Then I use my Lush's grease lightning. I have two lush products, this and the lotion. Grease lightning is the holy grail for most people with acne prone skin and I'm no different. It's like a serum but not sticky at all. It really tightens around where you put it but goes away after few minutes. You're supposed to use it on your trouble spots but I just put it all over my face.
5. Then I finish with Enzymion by lush. It's a face lotion and warning, it does have a funky citric + enzyme smell as the name suggests and it's a perfect lotion for acne prone oily skin. I used to use the blue herbal lotion from Kiehl's acne line in the US but I've been living in Korea for about 2 years now and for some reason it's discontinued here so I resorted to this. It is expensive but a little goes a long way.
6. It's hidden behind those giant bottles but I use a Innisfree's truecare non-nano suncreen spf 48 PA+++. It's a noncomedogenic suncreen that also controls your sebum so is perfect for oily acne prone skin. 
7. This is controversial but as part of the morning routine, I use Bareminerals Blemish Rescue powder foundation. It's a powder foundation that contains salicylic acid so it's got skincare benefits. Also it's powder foundation so it's more breathable and less damaging to your skin.

My PM routine is same from step 1 through 5 and may add a skin brightening mask in between toners and lotions. I sometimes switch it up with Kiehl's Clearly corrective dark spot solution and clearly corrective brightening and smoothing moisturizer instead of the lush products. I have a fair skin and I don't really tan and just get blotchy and weird so I just like to keep my skin brighter and whiter. 

Except for the astringent, they're all water based products so doesn't feel heavy on the skin and absorbs easily. I also use those face massagers like Clarisonic to allow my skin to better absorb the products but honestly, it's usually a hassle and rubbing it with my fingers (not hands) is good enough. 

&#x200B;

I hope my post helped. After I changed to these products, except for my scars, my skin cleared up completely. This post reminded me of everything I don't wanna do to my skin. Glad I changed Care to elaborate? Yeah I agree 100%, specially those LUSH products. They are incredibly irritating and useless. Same here, dunno why you‚Äôre being downvoted. This post reminds me of the days when I bought the big blue bottle of clean and clear astringent, or when I would use undiluted TTO on my face!! I‚Äôve come to learn that super gentle and hydrating products are what my face needs to be happy. Everyone's skin is different and I for one don't condone how this sub can be collectively snobby and judgemental however the 'ultimate guide part' is just a bit preachy. I feel like I'm looking at something a preachy and judgmental sales person would say to me when shopping. Ofc it's great if it works for you but over stripping your skin is kinda misleading advice I know right I don't mean to be condescending but looking at this makes my face hurt. Yeah drying your skin out takes out acne but does more harm than good The title is **MY** ultimate guide not **THE** ultimate guide. No where on my post do I say you have to this do and only this.  Also isn't it snobby and judgmental on your part to be "This post reminded me of everything I don't wanna do to my skin. Glad I changed" You're doing the exact same thing you don't like this sub can be. I literally it could be helpful those with similar/same concerns as me not everyone in general. Not to mention there are other aspects of my life that deals with hydrating and taking care of other aspects of my skin but it was snobby and judgmental on your part. Hi Kettle, this is pot. You're black. Omg is it that deep lmao. A lot of ppl have the same concerns as you but astringent really doesn't solve acne. But you do you. Yeah I'm the kettle so what lmao It makes zero sense to organize your products by color. It's physically impossible to use all this stuff. Wow. Those shelves must be a nightmare to dust This is amazing and I wish I had it all but also maybe slightly wasteful? I only buy what I use. Do you think she uses all of this? Idk. If I had the money I would have shelves like this too Though it‚Äôs super blurry, when you zoom in you can see that a lot of this (particularly the bottom shelf) is haircare and fragrance. So while it‚Äôs still a shit ton of product, I can kinda get it. The picture is so blurry I can't even recognize any products. Even with the hair & fragrance products included, I'm overwhelmed. I feel like I need a stock list just to keep track of everything Kinda seems like an *aesthetics* thing I have my Shelfie organized by color too. Everything I have can be seen on two small shelves though. Otherwise it doesn‚Äôt make too much sense. I still love it though coming from someone who even color coordinates their underrate drawer. Maybe she keeps empties and uses them as decoration? Just a thought. It seems very aesthetically pleasing. I agree. At the same time I want it. Seriously! I have a piece of furniture that has a TON of perfumes on it (probably 40) and it‚Äôs such a pain to dust each product and the furniture. I can‚Äôt imagine! I honestly think she just keeps stuff even if she doesn‚Äôt use it/love it to create and keep this color coordinated shelf. Imagine having the money to buy any skincare/beauty product you wanted?!?! 

I love those beauty advent calendars from QVC, but I didn‚Äôt even keep the products I didn‚Äôt use because it was just too much. I gave them to friends who used them. It was a story on Instagram, I took a screen shot. I know you can‚Äôt see each product. I only know what about a dozen are from their bottles but the reason I posted it was the sheer quantity/color coordination. I think she is rich enough that she can just buy everything and keep it stocked. Plus, she probably gets PR. Either way, wish I could go through it all! I would buy La Mer and like a TON of French sunscreens to try out! I was thinking what I would buy if I could as well. I would buy everything La Mer sells. All of Drunk Elephant and Tatcha as well. Even as a normal- middle class person I am trying to get into the French sunscreen market. I need those filters dammit **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Yes and no. If you‚Äôre using it to improve your skin, absolutely, but if you‚Äôre not going anywhere you don‚Äôt have to. 

I took advantage of the extra time in lockdown and went full 10 step skincare. Do whatever feels right for you. I would definitely take advantage of this time to get the retinoid going, as you may experience purging etc at the beginning. 

Just don‚Äôt start a load of new products all at once, introduce things one at a time to check for reactions etc.

Once you are outside again, you will need a sunscreen if you want to use the retinoid. Personally, I like my skin looking nice for myself, not anyone else, so I always do my routine no matter my schedule. 

If you do start your retinoid, be aware of your sun exposure (even indoors, even in winter) as you become more photosensitive using that product. You may not need it all the time, but don‚Äôt forget about sunscreen if you go outside I can‚Äôt really imagine myself skipping AM or PM. I really need to cleanse in the morning because my skin gets oily overnight, but I also really need to cleanse in the evening because my skin feels dirty even if I stay at home (cooking, touching my face, etc.)

Also, I notice you use both retinoid and the Buffet serum. It is generally advised against using both of them at the same time (e.g. both in the PM) because the copper peptides can react with retinoids and increase your skin sensitivity. This is why you use them at different times. If you like these two products, it would be difficult to strip your skincare down to a single routine, unless you want to alternate between the two of them everyday. I mean I still do skincare. To me it doesn‚Äôt seem like a waste just because Im indoors because for one, cleansing and moisturizing your face is essential in general. If I didn‚Äôt wash myself everyday I would look like an oily mess and be breaking out with congestion. Moisturizing is essential for maintaining overall skin health. It‚Äôs good for dehydration and aging and especially if you have dry skin! 

Retinol is always important because it‚Äôs anti aging. It‚Äôs a preventative measure to keep your skin looking young and healthy. 

In general I use skincare as a way to maintain my skin and prevent damage. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether I‚Äôm going out or staying in. Also if I had the mentality of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going out all month so why do I need to do this‚Äù I would seriously let myself go and just not shower, never brush my teeth, etc. Lolol Skincare is not like wearing makeup. You don't pick it up and put it down depending on whether or not you go out and people see you. It's maintaining the condition of your skin or working towards a goal. Quitting skincare for one month will set you back one month...It's more like putting a weight loss plan on hold. You won't make any progress and maybe you'll fall behind. Hey! Just an FYI, be careful with using that many physical exfoliants. Everyone‚Äôs skin is different, but in the long run over exfoliating can lead to irritation, just a heads up.  hey! first time poster here and long time lurker.

i‚Äôve been working really hard with my skin for years, and over the past few months, i‚Äôve been seeing such great results from my regimen. i have suuper oily skin (some people think it glows so i‚Äôll take that lol) and i‚Äôve been trying to combat the acne that comes with excess oils! :)

my AM regimen is:

-wash with shea moisture olive/green tea shea butter soap
-use 2 drops of hyaluronic acid
-mix argan oil with olay spf moisturizer for a little added glow. 

PM:

-wash with shea moisture sea kelp and pearl protein soap
-exfoliate with st. ives apricot scrub or oatmeal scrub
-mask (every other day usually). i love the glam glow supermud
-2 drops hyaluronic acid
-mix argan oil with no7 beautiful skin night cream or shea butter (whichever i‚Äôm feeling more) for intense moisture while i sleep

i‚Äôve been sticking hard to this and my skin has developed a natural glow to it. i‚Äôve never felt more confident! thank you guys for always having great recommendations, they really help :)
 It‚Äôs great when you find something you like üòä

Could you give a mini review of what the different products do for you? I don‚Äôt know the Lush ones like the cup of coffee in the picture and am quite curious You're going to get a dozen different people telling you the apricot scrub is harmful because it causes micro tears in the skin. No one seems to be able to agree on how true that claim is, but this sub is like an anti-St. Ives apricot scrub cult just FYI. However, if your routine is working for you, then great! thank you! i didn‚Äôt know that! i‚Äôll slow down on my use of it. any other exfoliators you‚Äôd recommend instead?   I personally use a chemical exfoliant so I'm not the right person to ask. However in the past I picked up a few jelly masks (the self preserving ones) from Lush that exfoliate as you wash them away. Since you already have Lush products maybe you could look into that. But I'm sure someone else could be of more help. Be especially careful if you have active acne. Sometimes back when I used physical scrubs they would open or tear my zits which just made them bleed & spread the bacteria around. Also dried my skin out and made me flaky and oily which was a horrid combination. After switching to chemical exfoliants my pores are much smaller too, so that is a bonus.

Some good chemical exfoliants are Paula's Choice BHA 2% Skin Perfecting Liquid, goes on after cleanser & toner. Or The Ordinary has a AHA & BHA peel that works well as a weekly or monthly treatment. There are also glycolic acid or lactic acid serums. Depends on your skin, different ones work better for different people. But with these you won't be scrubbing your skin off, they work by going deeper into the pores to break up the clogs instead of just scraping off surface skin (plus you want to only get rid of the dead skin, and keep the healthy skin!). 

Anyway, everyone's preferences and needs are different. Glad you have found some things that work for you. Welcome to SCA and good luck! I was a major physical exfoliation addict, I had no idea it was damaging to my skin. Now I use drunk elephant babyfacial, and Framboos, chemical exfoliates, but the ordinary makes a MUCH cheaper duplicate item. They make my skin baby soft and they are fading my freckles! I‚Äôm so happy  A lot of those cleansers are very harsh and I think almost all of those products have added fragrances. So if your skin seems overly sensitive and acne prone, it could be all of that unfortunately. Clean and clear and the neutrogena acne face washes did absolutely no favors for my skin. That‚Äôs just my personal experience. 

You also have quite a few stripping products and I‚Äôm not seeing any moisture-focused products or an SPF.  I‚Äôd say your first step should be a good moisturizer. Over washing oily skin actually increases oil production, and moisturizing will help hydrate your skin. I would suggest using a more gentle cleanser like cerave. It could be that your oil (i assume you are oily based off choices of products) comes from dehydrating your skin with harsh products. I would avoid physical exfoliants, fragrances, and really foamy cleansers. Also, be sure the salicylic acid is formulated to be a product that stays on your skin, as opposed to one you rinse off. 

ALSO!!! Add SPF! elta MD is good, neutrogena is good. be sure to use mineral instead of synthetic, as synthetic can cause breakouts/sensitivities for some people.

Just as added other notes, I use some of these every day, like the daily cleanser and moisturizer, but others like the mask and facial bar are only when I feel I need to use them.  Do you have any suggestions for fragrance free things I could try and a good moisturizer? I‚Äôd love to here what works for you and see if it‚Äôll help me out!  What would you say an average day looks like for your skincare routine?  Cerave PM (moisturizer) and Cerave face washes--either of their face was is good. maybe try the foaming first. It was a lot of trial and error for me. The best thing that helped me was to look up products on Beautypedia.com and cosdna.com while also randomly searching this site for good recommendations. I think using these three sources will help you find good things for your specific skin type. My skin leans dry, so what works for me may not work for you. I think you should take a peak at the side bar for recs. 

Remember to keep a list of products that didn‚Äôt work for your skin too and see if you can find common ingredients in those products. This will eventually make it easier for you to find products that work for your skin. 

Also remember to patch test and introduce new products slowly so that you know exactly what works and what doesn‚Äôt.  My current pseudo-routine is wake up, daily cleanser or grapefruit oil free scrub, moisturizer, go to school, get home and use the rapid clear stuff and black head eraser before bed. 

Really, I don‚Äôt have a good one at all. I‚Äôm trying my best to get it down pat but I don‚Äôt know what I should use when. 

My routine is non existent at this point. I‚Äôm trying to go from washing my face twice a day with whatever is around me, to actually having it set in stone when I do what.  How is that working for you? If you still have acne, would you say it's mild, moderate, or severe? Can you tell us if your skin feels dry, or tight after washing? 

You have a few different salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments, which are great. Once we know more about your skin we can help you build a routine.   I have mild acne, worsens around periods. Mainly struggling with large pores, oily skin, and deep, painful pimples that tend to like soft scab over. I was on minocyclyne and got MASSIVE improvements, but it was making my chronic headaches more frequent so I had to be taken off. My skin is mostly oily and I‚Äôm really looking for an improvement from how things used to be. 

I pick at my skin a lot from stress or anxiety so I‚Äôve made it my mission to feel and look good in my skin. It‚Äôs a self empowerment thing and it, stupidly enough, means a lot to me. 

[EDIT] And mostly tight after washing, not so much dry.  Is your acne active (red, white/clear puss filled) or closed comedone type (bumps underneath skin with trapped sebum inside)?  Where is your acne located on your face?  Also what is your budget and do you have access to purchase products online?  That will help with recommendations as well. It tends to be closed comedone, I mainly get those types on my forehead and sides of my face. I also get clogged blackhead type things mostly on my nose, chin, and cheeks, and those tend to pus up and become inflamed. 

My budget... I‚Äôm not really sure. Not really above 35$ per thing I‚Äôd imagine? The only real online thing I have access to is amazon, nothing else really.  That's a beautiful shelfie and the labeling is adorable! 

I have a question however and it is not about skincare. Where did you get the Ditto and the Pikachu? They are perfect! 25 year old female

skin type: more dry in fall and winter, slightly less in spring and summer

skin goals: target occasional hormonal spots, maintain hydration, aging prevention

this is how I store my products and I couldn't bother to lay them all out but i wanted to make sure you could at least sort of know what the products looked like so i labeled them in a photo editing app on my phone hah. i have no storage in the bathroom and I prefer having all of them like this next to my bed. i've rated each product out of 5 stars with my top 3 at the bottom since there are too many products, but i will review other individual products in depth if you are interested!

top 3 products review

1. I absolutely love the I'M FROM mugwort cream, it leaves the most beautiful finish after all my other products and not only lock in the nutrients but provide a topical layer of hydration. The packaging is very simple and a beautiful shade of green and the herbal scent smells amazing. The cream is almost gel like but doesn't absorb as quickly as a gel moisturizer might. It definitely fulfills what I want it to do which is hydrate and nourish although it might be a little bit TOO hydrating for some.  I rave about this cream all the time but have a hard time recommending it to others because I don't really know anyone with skin as dry as mine so it might break someone out if they're more combo/oily. I have still a bit more than half left to go but I would repurchase especially for fall and winter. This moisturizer works very well for me under makeup and keeps my foundation looking radiant all day.
2. Even though I don't like using the term, the [free plus mild soap](https://www.amazon.com/Kanebo-free-Gentle-Cleansing-Cream/dp/B008ONG2DE/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KGKO6SLBKGHT&keywords=freeplus+mild+soap&qid=1564671477&s=gateway&sprefix=free+plus%2Caps%2C119&sr=8-1) is definitely my holy grail cleanser. It cleanses exceptionally well while being very gentle and non-drying but not strong enough to take off eye makeup. This is a cleanser I've repurchased the most and will continue to do so until it not longer works for me. There is no noticeable smell that I can make of and the packaging is very simple. I don't see any negatives so far other than maybe it doesn't seem to last very long and it's easy to squeeze too much but it's pretty affordable especially if buying in Asia from my experience.
3. My other current favorite is the Perricone MD eye cream. I'll have to say I have never used any other products from this brand before and this was a phenomenal introduction into the line. While I can't say it makes a significant difference in terms of firming, it's definitely hydrating and non-scent so I feel it's very safe for the delicate eye area. I have noticed the lines around my lashes have been minimized with this cream in combo with the ordinary caffeine solution. The jar packaging is a little bit frustrating since I feel it can be sort of unhygienic and it's rather pricey.  I would like to finish the jar to see the complete result but I would also repurchase and maybe even gift one to my mom! haha thank you! they're are from one of those random blind box vending machines in china, i believe they have them in japan as well. my boyfriend didn't want them so they're mine now! So beautifully formatted!!

You have pretty much all the [required Shelfie info](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_7._follow_our_post_requirements), except the reviews are a bit too short to count for full reviews (they're more like mini-reviews right now). In-depth top 3 reviews should at least cover:

- the packaging

- product feel & smell

- what are the positive & negative effects

- does it do what it should/what you bought it for

- overall opinion

Check out [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cj3hfs/shelfie_my_very_first_shelfiei_hope_i_did_it_right/) for an example of in-depth reviews, or you could do mini reviews for each of your products!

This isn't required (unless you go for mini-reviews for each!), but how do you like the Farmacy Honey Potion? Thank you so much for your reply! 

Now that I've actually read your post I would also like to ask your opinion about TO caffeine solution. Do you think it made any difference on your eye area? Does it make you look more "woken up"? And does it smell like anything? Hi thank you! Will update the reviews! you're very welcome! i was wondering if they made other ones and it looks like i found [them](https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Charmander-Hitokage-Character-Collection/dp/B07MKR59R8/ref=pd_bxgy_21_img_2/145-5749279-9859448?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07MKR59R8&pd_rd_r=cdee5f40-d68d-4c04-9b7d-2c2d8590babb&pd_rd_w=8n44b&pd_rd_wg=pP7kQ&pf_rd_p=a2006322-0bc0-4db9-a08e-d168c18ce6f0&pf_rd_r=WZMTKMSDQJMWH84FCCJN&psc=1&refRID=WZMTKMSDQJMWH84FCCJN)! might add the bulbasur to the family!

I love love the caffeine solution but it's not a multi purpose product by any means but it does its one job for me very well which is de-puffing the eye area! It lays a good base for a more potent eye cream. I don't really have dark eye circles so I can't speak on whether or not they would make a difference in that sense but it's a great product for layering. **Hi everyone!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* I've been testing products for years on my skin, it's very sensitive and prone to breakouts. After consistent trouble, I ended up on accutane and now that I am free and clear of the cystic acne, the below finally has worked and my skin is glowing! Now all I need to focus on is elasticity and wrinkle prevention..

Mario Badsceu and FAB are my favorite products, but the Glossier serums were a gift last Christmas and I loved them so much I swapped out my old serums for these! From a moisturizer standpoint, I cannot rave enough about the ultra repair cream. After having the worst dry skin for months on end while on the meds, this moisturizer saved me. It's become my daily over the clinique, but I still use that one if I'm feeling dry in the middle of the day! I think my favorite product I use is the Mario B collagen night cream. That product slapps! My BF actually started using it under his eyes at night too. 

Check out my full routine below:

AM:

* Cleanser - CeraVe daily - I was using neutrogena but having major problems with redness. CeraVe isn't harsh and leaves me feeling completely cleansed. 
* Toner - Mario Badescu witch hazel and rose water > this is amazing for dry skin, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean, really gets rid of the excess oils/dirt that cleansing misses.
* Serum - Glossier Super Glow (vitamin c and magnesium) > I was using The Ordinary vitamin C but got this as a gift so figured why not. I am never going back! It's a milky texture that just soaks right into your skin, its really helped even out my skin tone and I always feel like I am glowing after using. Also, the packaging and bottle is high class. 
* Moisturizer - FAB Ultra repair cream > I started using this from a friend reco after I started accutane, my usual Clinique wasn't cutting it anymore. It's so hydrating, and while it does feel thick it settles well on my face. 
   * FAB coconut water cream if I‚Äôm having an extra dry day > I'm not a big fan of scented products but this is nice. Its a watery consistency that has a nice cooling effect when you first put on. I actually use this as a base for makeup too. 
* Sunscreen - Not pictured (it's with my makeup) EltaMD UV Clear SPF46 > tbh this was derm recommended for my sensitive skin, its not super heavy and I haven't had any problems with it 

PM:

* Cleanser - CeraVe daily
* Toner - Mario Badsceu aloe vera > such a gentle toner, i like this one for night as it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean, and ready for all the treatments!
* Serum 1 - Glossier super bounce (hydraulic acid and vitamin b5) > I wasn't planning on adding this to my routine, but again it was a gift so why not.  It;s the same milky texture as super glow, and also soaks in. It leaves me feeling so moisturized and soft. The first time I used it I kept petting my own cheek!
* Serum 2 - FAB Retinol > Quick note, I use this every other day as it can leave the skin feeling harsh if overused. I've tried a few retinol's before, and was hesitant because this is so pricey, but you only need a small amount and its by far the best that I have tried. It's more of a cream, and it has really helped the color of my skin. I have terrible allergies that cause the skin under my eyes to look sunken in and purple. This has really helped with that pigmentation.
* Treatment 1- Mario Badsceu elasto-collagen night cream > This can feel a little greasy and heavy, but it's helped smooth my fine lines. 
* Treatment 2 - Mario Badsceu ceramide eye gel > I use this around my eyes instead of the collagen cream, and have for sure noticed a difference in my fine lines there too! It can be sticky so I use a very small amount. 
* Moisturizer - Mario Badsceu glycolic skin renewal complex > superpower moisturizer! I may stop using this once the weather is less dry.
   * FAB ultra repair cream if it‚Äôs an extra dry day Your routine looks lovely! But do you use an SPF? It's especially important if you are using retinol, otherwise it can be more ageging. Can you please add in a mini review for each product?  It's something we require for Shelife posts.  Thank you! no spf? The EltaMD UV Clear is SPF46! Not pictured as it is with my makeup. Added! Sorry, I have been editing the comment to include the full routine in bullets! Apparently I am not great at formatting on mobile..... If you have skin sensitivites or ingredient sensitivities, I would try to keep it minimal and only try one or two products at best. I found that it takes 2 weeks of regular use to see results. Sometimes it takes a month or a few months, depending on the product active.

I‚Äôm using P50V, P50 PIGM 400 and a few serums. I do like their toners. Not as impressed by their serums. definitely try Biologique recherche p50. And i think i see Biologique recherche eye cream, you should try it. I personally want to try those Barbara Sturm products, but you could also bee line right to the La Mer. I'd be all over the BR... Also if that's the ren calming mask, it's a great one to try! what does she do with all this? there's no chance she can use this all up before its expiration date. As you can see, my friend has the most enviable array of high quality skincare products. They‚Äôve said I can use whatever I want, but honestly, what would actually make a difference in three days? They swear by Dr Sturm, but I‚Äôm tempted by Creme de la Mer.


FWIW my skin type is combination with bad under eye discolouration. I usually wash with CeraVe hydrating cleanser and use Beauty Pie Superhealthy Skin serum, Boots No7 protect and perfect eye cream and Ultrasun factor 30. La mer üòçüòçüòç I actually just used the Ole Hendriksen vitamin C Truth serum in the end as felt bad nicking the Barbra Sturm and the others were more heavy duty night serums... I really rated it though! I currently use the Beauty Pie Vitamin C serum which is very similar, but I'd consider buying OH in the future. Which of their serums did you try? I am interested in them but not ready to pull the trigger until I have more information. They actually gave me the P50 as they said they don't like it! I've yet to try though, I ended up using Creme de la Mer mostly. Oh, and the BR eye cream, which is amazing. Ha! I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve even heard of BR before... going to go have a peek now! Yeah it's kind of mad to be honest. Ironically, they've also had a load of botox and fillers, so half the anti-ageing things are kind of voided. I guess they throw them away eventually. It does seem like a waste, but they earn megabucks and this is their little obsession I think. Which Dr Sturm products do they really think worked? I‚Äôve been dying to try the super anti aging serum but don‚Äôt want to fork up the money to buy it lol. I love La Mer Soft Cream better bc it doesn‚Äôt have mineral oil in it, but haven‚Äôt tried the original Creme de La Mer yet though. * Placenta serum - it helps acne calm down and go away faster, plus I noticed they didn't leave a dark mark, which they usually do. Smells bad. Texture is like water so be careful not to spill it on its way to your face. Provides very light hydration.
* Splenodermine - for matured sagging skin. Won't help young firm skin. Smells bad. Texture is a watery but easier to handle than Placenta serum. Not terribly impressed but I do see some results. It's been 2 weeks so I'll give it more time. It'll be a toss up between Splenodermine and A-Glyca since I only want one for firming, not two serums.
* A-Glyca: I haven't opened this one yet but it's for matured aging skin. I want to give Splenodermine more time to work so that I can compare it to this one.
* Colostrum: The spa sent me Iribiol by accident so this one is arriving later today. It's for super dry skin, which mine is. I will also try this out later next week so that I can evaluate it independently of their other serums. Thank you! Did they let you keep the Iribiol? That'd be pretty cool. Free serum. I'm mostly interested in the Placenta and the Oligo Proteines but I still don't know. Haha. I wish although I've no use for Ibibiol since I've no acne, other than product induced breakouts. They sent me a prepaid label so I'm mailing it back to them. I was recommended the Oligo Proteines too but I opted not to get it based on reviews. I feel that Skinceuticals Discoloration Defense does a great job at fading pigmentation at a fraction of the price. I'll check that out. I like Skinceuticals. I just don't want to spend that much on something I might not like and they don't have serum samples like their other products. These are the main products I use, Blissoma has been a life changer for my complexion. I have oily, acneic, and sensitive skin and this line of products has changed my life! Highly recommend.

[Toner ](https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-us/collection/tea-tree-oil-for-skin/tea-tree-skin-clearing-mattifying-toner/p/p000521)  I do like it! I only use a little bit on my oil cleanse concoction of all the oils in the picture. I use rosehipseed as kind of a carrier oil, it‚Äôs the most abundant in the mixture. I have not used the hemp seed alone, but the mixture is glorious for my skin!  I have oily skin that is very sensitive. All of these products and the occasional sheet mask from Facetory has helped calm my redness and detoxify my skin. My daily routine always starts with the Clearasil face wash followed by the tea tree toner. After the toner, I apply a small amount of the Blissoma Smooth A+ serum. Once that has settled, I apply the Blissoma Restore deep healing oil by gently patting it into my skin. Depending on my skin status, I will follow that with Mario Badescu aloe moisturizer or Blissoma Pure moisturizer. My routine varies from night to day and once a week I will do a mask. My night routine usually takes longer because I spend more time massaging products into my face and follow my moisturizer with the Mario Badescu drying lotion and the Badescu face mist. Every night, I use The Ordinary caffeine solution under my eyes for dark circles. I also apply a bit of caster oil to my lashes using an empty container of Better Than Sex Mascara. 

Individual reviews
Aztec secret clay mask: I mix my mask with ACV and apply a thick coating on my face. I usually let it sit until my whole face is pulsating and then sit for 30 min longer. I always do this on a day I wash my hair because the best way to rinse it is in the shower, otherwise it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to get off. I use this mask when my skin is broken out or feeling very congested, I LOVE this product.

Cetaphil: I usually use Blissoma Free facial cleanser, they are very comparable. Blissoma was out of stock so I‚Äôve been using this. Not much of a lather which I like, it did take some time to get used to. I learned that the best way to treat my skin is to nourish it and stop using so many salicylic acid products that end up drying it out. I use this cleanser morning and night, it‚Äôs perfect for my sensitive skin. 

Body shop tea tree toner: this is something I have been using since high school (5 ish years). I will always use this toner! It is the only product from the tea tree line that I can stand to use twice a day. I apply it with a cotton round and let it dry before applying my serum. 

Mario Badescu facial spray: I have the rose and green tea sprays and I use both daily. I usually use them at night to add an extra layer of moisture and during the day for a makeup setting spray. They are so easy to use so if I‚Äôm in a rush i use these after my serum. 

Mario Badescu drying lotion: This does a good job of healing blemishes after extraction when they might breakout again. As for new zits, it helps to slow the process, but does not heal as well. I use this almost every night recently because my skin has been v hormonal lately. 

Mario Badescu aloe moisturizer: This one is perfect for summer, smells like SPF and aloe. I only use a little bit because I feel it makes my skin look oily. It feels amazing and lightweight going on, plus it has the added protection of SPF and aloe added in! 

Hibiscus rose spray: I don‚Äôt use this one as much because the sprayer is like one stream so it‚Äôs hard to get it all over. It does help to moisturize and even my complexion. It smells amazing and it pretty inexpensive.

Blissoma smooth A+ serum: my all time favorite for my skin! It visibly evens my skin tone and helps tone down my breakouts. I use this after my toner, instantly calms my skin. It smells very natural and fresh. 

Blissoma restore healing oil: I use this oil day and night, it takes a couple hours to soak in all the way but so so so worth it. I usually pay it in to give it time to work. It smells amazing, very floral and fresh smelling. Blissoma has great natural ingredients that act as food for your skin. I‚Äôm in LOVE with Blissoma and always will be. 

Blissoma refine mask: this mask is the consistency of a curry powder. I love it because it is exfoliating and clearing. I use it once a week after my face cleanser. Apply a small amount to each section of my face and exfoliate for a good 5 minutes then let set for 15 and rinse with warm water, followed by toner serum and oil.

All the mountain rose oils: I use these all for my oil cleansing days. Every other night I will use these instead of my cleanser and apple to my face dry. I massage my face for a good 7-10 minutes and rinse off with a washcloth as warm as I can stand to open my pores. Once it‚Äôs all rinsed I follow with serum and restore oil. 

The ordinary caffeine serum: I use this under my eyes daily. Every night no matter what and during the day if I don‚Äôt feel like doing my makeup. It‚Äôs very light, not much smell to it. I do notice a difference in my dark circles after a good week of use. I would like something stronger because if I forget to use it before bed and don‚Äôt do my makeup the next day...it‚Äôs rough. My dark circles are big purple bags under my eyes and I can‚Äôt stand to deal with them! This product helps so so much!!  I see you also have the MRH tamanu oil üëÄüëÄ

Thank you! Gotcha, thanks!! Blissoma products are around $35-$50 per product. The main ones I get are about $39. I‚Äôm located in Portland, OR and my facial lady always has these products on hand for purchase. Blissoma does ship their stuff out fairly quickly too. Well worth the purchase, all natural products that feel and smell great!

[Blissoma ](https://www.blissoma.com/)  Updated in the comments! Thank you! Girl this amount of products is equivalent to 10 routines. Not exactly the basics...but glad your having fun Holy shit, I think you need to rethink your definition of basic.  How are you liking the CeraVe micellar water? I‚Äôve heard that it stings the eyes when you apply it there I can get LaRoche Posay on Beautylish I think, I‚Äôll try it! Thank you!!! I‚Äôm 26, a mother, and a stress smoker. I live in the Deep South (it‚Äôs sunny!) I have EXTREMELY dry, aging skin, with some bad dullness issues 

My routine varies a LOT, I‚Äôm not sure if this is ideal but because I have dry skin I don‚Äôt use the chemical exfoliants and brighteners every night. I‚Äôll use them one evening, and the next morning I‚Äôll go heavier than usual on the moisturizers. 

AM: Wash face with Water (this seems to be helping!! I just stopped using cleanser twice a day)
- Rose Hip Seed Oil
- Other oils if I just used a brightened or irritating compound)
- HA 
- Either the Daily Moisturizing Cream Or Lotion 
- Eye Repair Cream

PM: 
Remove Makeup with Micellar Water OR use the Glycolic Acid Toner if it was a no makeup day (every other day or so) 
Wash with the Hydrating cleanser
Use EITHER the Peel (every other week for now)
OR Granactive Retinoid (at most once a week)
OR Lactic Acid and Vitamin C Suspension (every other day unless I use one of the above) 
OR none of the above (I take a break from these every other day) 
- HA 
- thinking about including Squalane here but I‚Äôm not sure??
- Cera Ve Night Cream
- Eye Repair 

I‚Äôm interested in starting to Double Cleanse. Neither the Argan or the Rose Hip Seed oils seemed great for this, but I‚Äôve heard the Marula Oil is? Any input on that or opinions?


Product list:
TO:
-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution
Which is the only toner I will ever use again for the rest of my life, so help me God
- Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion
- 100% Organic Cold Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil
I know some people hate it, but I love it so much. I like a Dewey look that doesn‚Äôt look greasy and this hits the mark 
- AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution
I can only do it once a week but I feel like a goddess lately. Previously I was focused entirely on Moisturizing so this, the Lactic Acid and the Vit C Suspension were recent additions, but I feel like there‚Äôs a noticeable difference in my skin tone since using them and the small bit of acne I did occasionally get hasn‚Äôt made an appearance in months. I mean literally not one pimple. In months. 
- Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 
It‚Äôs just a staple. Everything else I own has this and still nothing compares to a little HA after washing my face and layering on the oils 
- 100% Cold Pressed Morrocan Argan Oil
Winter only product for me, I love it but it takes it a back seat to the Rose Hip Seed Oil. I do use it in my hair though! 
- Lactic Acid 10% + HA 
New favorite! It stopped stinging after the first use, and now I can actually layer it and the Vit C with no discomfort 
- 100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil
This one and the squalane are new for me! 
- 100% Plant Derived Squalane
FINALLY!!! It‚Äôs no longer back ordered and I can try it for myself 
- Vitamin C Suspension 30% in silicone 
Once you get past the gritty feeling, it‚Äôs a staple. I‚Äôm not sure which part of my brightening routine is pulling the most weight but I suspect it‚Äôs this. 
- High Adherence Silicone Primer
- Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA
Surprisingly awesome for being so cheap. Absorbs SO well. 
-  Coverage Foundation
- Serum Foundation

Cera Ve
- Moisturizing Cream
I wish I could take a freaking bath in this. I never realized it was different than the lotion. Im emotional about this lotion
- Hydrating Facial Cleanser
The dry skin holy grail, what else is there to say??
- Daily Moisturizing Lotion
lighter version of the cream, for those 99% humidity days 
- Hydrating Micellar Water
- Skin Renewing Night Cream 
I‚Äôm not sure if this is a faux pas but I love the way this feels so much that I actually sometimes wear it during the day 
- Eye Repair Cream
I SWEAR I can actually see a difference after a few months. It‚Äôs minuscule but it‚Äôs there. 
- skin Renewing Day Cream 
- Facial Moisturizing Lotion with Broad Spectrum sunscreen 
These two are my winter sunscreens (I live in Florida, sunscreen is an all year affair) 


- Nuetrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch SPF 100
I would rather not have to use this but I live in Florida. If I‚Äôm gonna be in the sun for more than ten minutes, I will slather myself in this. 
  Ten?? I get that it‚Äôs a lot of different products but I really didn‚Äôt think it was that extra. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something.  I have the CeraVe and it burns like a mofo. Really disappointing.  I use the garnier micellar water (pink cap) and I've never experienced it stinging my eyes, and I use it practically only for removing my eye makeup (if you're looking for a micellar water that doesn't sting lol) It does a little bit if I just glomp it on with a cotton ball, usually I try to avoid my eyes and then use a bit of it on a q-tip to get the stuff really close to my eyes (eyeliner mostly). 

It does sting a little but my eyes are sensitive, I‚Äôve never found a makeup remover that didn‚Äôt sting.  Re: your double cleanse question - I've found it better to use an oil cleansing product that is specifically designed for that step in the process, because they wash off completely. I'm currently happy with the new Palmers Ultra Gentle Facial Cleansing oil (bought because it was cheap, to try out oil cleansing). But many good brands have inexpensive versions of this. Basic= cleasner + moisturizer + SPF 


You have retinol, every acid from TO, multiple cleasnsers, various toners, serveral eye creams, a plethora of moisturizer, a myriad of oils and numerous serums 

Just a *tad* more then basic 

 Is there one that doesn‚Äôt?? I want it! I‚Äôve seen a lot of people recommend that one so I might look more into it, thank you!  I see, thank you! Simple, LaRoche Posay, and Bioderma all have worked for me (at least in the no-eye-burning department). I also have one of those on the bed! I don‚Äôt take up anywhere near a whole bed full of room. It‚Äôs perfect to keep my phone, computer, some books. I love it! 

How do you feel about the Rose tonic?  Just checking in to say I love your tiny bathtub. I have a LOT of products. The ones on the left and the middle are my most used.

Milk cooling stick I'm not the OP, but I have used the Rose Tonic and noticed no impact from it.  I was hoping it would help with redness. What are your thoughts on the pixi glow tonic and up&up bp gel I love the glow tonic and it's a HG for me. However, I can't use it every day because I get too irritated. 

I think the BP gel is pretty good. It's supposed to compare to Persa-gel. I only get whiteheads/pustules, so lately I've been trying hydrocolloid dots for maybe 2 days and then I'll use the BP gel for the rest of the time until it's gone. It's been going pretty well. I think it used to dry out the area pretty badly, but nowadays I just moisturize everything and don't notice drying out of the pimples. how often do you use the glow tonic to avoid irritation? it mildly irritated my skin the first time i tried it for a few days! I think I use it about once a week at night. I could probably do it more frequently though. I was using it twice a day and that was too much! thanks for the info!! looks like a great selection. &#x200B;

**My skin type:** Combination, Sensitive

**Skin concerns:** Dull Lacklustre Skin, Minor Age Lines, Fixation with Glow

**Skin goals:** 30 Y O Canadian, who wants to continue to look 23 (Without any make-up)

&#x200B;

**From Right to left:**

&#x200B;

ELAN (NIOD) Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid 30% Network (best Vitamin C non-reactive acid I have used to date!, it is costly but much better than Drunk Elephant and others as this is the most stable form of Vitamin C ever. No Drama-Drama but pure Vitamin Boost for lack lustre skin and minor signs of aging and hyper-pigmentation)

Lip Bio-Lipid Concentrate (NIOD) (Only Lip Plumper Oil I have used which has long term results, my lip contour has visibly increased in width. It does dry quickly so I slather some LinoLips over it to seal it). I have tried Lip Injection Extreme, Buxom, DIOR, nothing worked! This is costly as it is from NIOD (DECIEM) but you literally need to just run your pinky over the dropper and don't even need a full drop! Lasted me a good 8-9 months of daily use twice a day)

**Acids and Retinoids:**

The Ordinary-

Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion (Best formulation of Retinoid I have stumbled upon, non-irritating, safe to use more than 2 times a week). Fab for wrinkles, skin imperfections and dark spots. (I have tried both prescription based and Paula's choice, Sunday Liley, Drunk Elephant - And wasted all my money as they are not as stable and potent as this formula.) 

AHA 30% BHA 2% Peeling Solution (This is a quick facial in a bottle for instant exfoliation without too much irritation, I use this occasionally before special events for a spa-like facial cleans and glow) Please do not put this on your face for more than 8-9 mins tops. It can be a bit irritating for sensitive skin, so patch test is highly recommended.

Lactic Acid 10% + HA (Mild, regular use worthy acid, start with this acid if you are a newbie to acids by mixing it with a mild moisturizer twice a week). I personally love this as it has Tasmanian pepper berry which has proved to be calming and balances the acid irritation. 

Alpha Lipoic Acid 5% (use only once a week, it is a flash of glow on your face next morning kind of elixir. It is moderately irritating for sensitive skin, so mix with moisturizer or ensure you slather a good moisturizer above this) Highly recommend this for peeps who have hyper pigmentation / tan / Lack-Lustre skin issues.

Caffeine Solution 5% EGCG (I use this only with CeraVe eye cream, it is a potent mix of Caffeine, like a shot of espresso to wake-up puffy eyes and also has helped with fine lines.)

Buffet + Copper Peptides 1% (If you need to calm your skin, whilst getting best of mild-anti-aging without any further damage, use this! everyday if you must AM+PM). I personally like this more than Buffet and other anti-aging creams / serums.

Regime:

AM: Cleanse with Hada Labo Cleanser (Not in the picture but link below)

[http://hadalabousa.com/products/moisturizing/](http://hadalabousa.com/products/moisturizing/)

Hada Labo Toner (The white one in the pic)

Snail Essence (COSRX)- Light weight, humectant that seals in the previous HA induced toner (Hada Labo). It takes around 1 minute to massage and then dry out before other applications.

I find this to be very satisfying in terms of sealing hydration without pore clogging and without being too chemical induced unlike others.

Buffet+Coppet Peptides (Or, Hyda Labo Brightening Lotion)

Eyes: TO Caffeine 5% + CeraVe on top of it

Sunscreen: Naruko Sunscreen (I do not like this, I prefer Blueberry Innisfree cause its much lighter and does not leave a white cast)

&#x200B;

PM:

Cleanse (Hada Labo - Mentioned above)

Hada Labo Toner (I layer this 3 times and its extremely hydrating even on my sometimes oily clogged skin)

Snail Essence (COSRX)

Caffeine 5%+CeraVe eye cream

(In rotation - Granactive Retinol 2% Emulsion / Or/ ELAAN/ Alpha Lipoic 5% / Lactice Acid 10%mixed with Natural Moisturizing Factors). **PLEASE NOTE: (Never use more than 2 acids in a week, esp if you have sensitive skin, then 1 acid per week is enough)**

&#x200B;

If I am not using an acid / ELAAN (Vitamin C) and want to rest my skin then Buffet+Copper Peptide)

&#x200B;

I follow this with Alternating Oils(One each day from the list above) When I am lazy and want a solid concoction then "B" Oil (It is a generous mix of all the above oils) Or ill just use Chia Seed oil(Added Tip, this is fab as an anti-irritant and Anti-inflammatory too so safe to use post any acids).

&#x200B;

I seal all of the above with my personal favourite Ceramide cream (Holika Holika) (This cream has exact ingredient list to the amazing IT cosmetics Confidence in a cream. without the cost and I find this more fluid and non pore clogging)

&#x200B;

Rest are not that important :P

&#x200B;

**Please let me know, if you guys need me to review any of these or need any information.**

Happy to help :)

Also, I will take free therapy from other Skin Addicts on this Sub-reddit ;)

I know this is going overboard, but I have tried, researched, and tested each of these products with help from my Derma Dr. friend and I take precaution to incorporate them as per Deciem and Derma recommendations only.

Thank you! I‚Äôd love to read your reviews on Hylamide SubQ Skin and CeraVe eye cream! What do you think of the COSRX snail essence? :)  Thoughts on the niod Sanskrit cleanser? I have a tube too, haven't tried it yet.  What are your thoughts on buffet? I want to get it for my boyfriend! Love this one. Iv been using this since 3 months now. Whenever I do not use my Ordinary regime, This is a perk me up.

The consistency is unmatched, it absorbs into your skin and is reviving and lightly moisturizing without being too greasy. The ALT-Retin (Plant derived and patented by Olehenriksen) is amazingggg... I apply a pea sized amount all over my face and neck (After Toning and Eye cream) and wake up to a glowing, plumped skin with my fine lines visibly plumed. It has greatly improved my skin texture, pores but above all, this has been the mildest form of Retin I have used and has given me the best and easy to maintain results.

&#x200B;

I use this as a sleeping mask  the night before for special events and it has never failed me.

Yes it is pricey, but it is my go-to when my skin is all over the place and needs motherly-gentle care and pampering.

If you use this every night for 2 days, you will see a visible difference in skin texture and fine lines.

It hasn't done much for Deep line on my forehead, the ELAAN(Vit C from NIOD) and Buffet+Copper has worked its magic on them and its almost gone after 2 weeks of regular use.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps :)

(Added tip: Get a couple of samples from Sephora and try it for 2 nights, you won't be disappointed with the price and purchase and will know how it suits you) I bought this only cause I have worked with Sephora and personally vouch for a few products there along with this. Its a beautiful concoction of all essential oils, without the greasiness and over powering nature of one over other! 

I have individual oils too for special needs, but if I am lazy and need a good boost of Vitamins and all the Lipids from all, then this is my go-to.

For the price, the quality is amazing, esp. the mix of ingredients itself. I rather one buy just this oil to start with, esp. if they are not crazy like me to buy individual oils for targeted concerns.

Rosehip Oil dint suit me (It actually suits only a few people because of its high lipid value and clogged my pore and gave me tiny red bumps and zits the next day!) However, this "B" Oil has minor amount of Rosehip which was perfect for me as it did not over power the low lipid and fluid ability of Marula and Chia which are also in this :) A Win-Win for all.

&#x200B;

Highly recommend using this Especially. for Fading Winters and transitioning into Spring. It is. bit oily but can easily be mixed (2-3 drops) with any light moisturizer and Voila, you have a luxury night cream / Moisture overnight mask without greasiness :)

&#x200B;

Hope this helped. Hi, 
I have made the requested edits.
I have added a robust regime with one line descriptors of all the products i use with hyper links as well)

Please do approve :)

Thanks. Sure :)

Hylamide as a brand is smack in-between the costlier NIOD and the cost effective The Ordinary from the same DECIEM family.

The difference is it is a level up than TO (In terms of moisturization) and a level less than overtly potent/ targeted science of NIOD products.

&#x200B;

SubQ face, - Hydrating, non-irritating and can be massaged to absorb. It is good for fine-lines and wrinkles but NOT deep lines. I find this to be quite hyped to be honest in comparison to the numerous reviews.

I would give it a 3.5/5 in terms of effectivity. I prefer Buffet+Coffer Peptide much more, it gives better results in the long run and doesn't feel as taut on your skin as SubQ.

&#x200B;

If major lines and deep wrinkles are your concern, and you need sustained and immediate results, please use Granactive Retinol 2% in emulsion, (It is God sent). Mildest form of Retinol I have used to date and can be used daily or 2/3 times a week. Has helped me immensely in my deep line on forehead and over all exfoliation without the chemical battlefield on my skin :)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

CeraVe Eyecream: I personally cannot live without this, it is a very cost effective and potent regular use eye-cream. I love the ingredient list on this and the sustained results it continues to show. I have mild dark circles from working over-nights and caffeine intake :P This has my fav brightening / lightening ingredient Niacinamide which is balanced beautifully with the Paraben free, Sulphate Free, MVE (Slow release) moisturizing factors. The Hyaluronic Acid coupled with Ceramides is a perfect mix balanced moisturizers / humectants.

&#x200B;

I have used a lot of eye-creams, some insanely costly ones as well, but I come home to this everyday after my bank account breaks and I come to ground reality, that beauty / Skincare is not supposed to be costly and overwhelming., I believe, the effectivity of a product irrespective of its price lies in its ingredients and a brands long standing best practices and guidelines. Potent ingredients from a brand that has a good track record is much more preferred than international mumbo-jumbo brands who invent a new ingredient every season (I was handling PR for Sephora, so I can speak from experience)

Beauty and skin care should be liberating and not make us feel like a worrisome lot who kick themselves after a luxury impulse spend. 

:)

Let me know if you have any specific concerns, I. would be glad to help further.

&#x200B;

&#x200B; I like it quite a lot. It's my second bottle. 
TBH it is raved about a lot in Asian circles and r/Asianbeauty but it's like hylamide serum but better. Nothing more nothing less.

There is no miracle in the slime of snail whatsoever, apart from giving it a deeper level of hydration and slimey massage worthy texture which does get absorbed gratually. 

For winters and spring this is a ++ but for summers and Autumn not so much. 

I like it because of the sweet price point and a bottle lasted me 7 Months of daily Am+PM use.

If you don't have any essence / hydrating / humactant serum at the moment, buy this for sure. If you do, you won't miss anything üòä not HG worthy for sure but more of a hey! So you are there on my shelf too, let me use you today for some deep hydration since I want to play with Mucin / snail slime and feel precious üòÇ It's good fermentation based cleanser, TBH I got a large size as there was a sale at Bay(Toronto) store. 
I think it's mediocre, in comparison to other cream / clay based cleansers, I find this to be just about okay.
2.5/5 at the most. I do not prefer the fragrance, it reminds me of beer gone bad lol.  It does not lather but rather feels like rubbing a watery cream all over your face which goes deeply into your skin. (I feel this is intentional although the packaging suggest to lather it in your palms, perhaps NIOD wants to ensure people that its a foaming cleanser too).

The cleanser itself is effective but it definately striped my skin off its natural oils and my skin felt super clean but taut! I had to slather some moisturizer immediately after.

I have combo/ sensitive skin and have a fairly good balance of oil in T-Zone. 
I suggest use this for a few days only on your T-Zone / when your skin feels extremely congested! 

If it doesn't suit you, return for a easy refund, I love that about deciem.

Being a NIOD range product, my expectations from this one were equally high due to the price point and one ups NIOD has over TO and hylamide range.

A cheaper alternative and much more gentler and my personal fav cleanser these days is Hada Labo (mentioned in my post) I use Missha Rice essence (a total dupe of the  cost you a kidney, SK II essence) (fermentation) over it sometimes to get the perks of the much hyped fermentation ingredients.

üòä
 
Buffet is a very good mix of ingredients for a daily use serum however... 

If anti-aging is his skin care concern then please get buffet+copper peptides it is amazing.... Extremely hydrating and fab for anti-aging in long term.

Esp. For guys who dont wanna follow a skin care regime, this is a very good elixir in a bottle to get started on.

If he is into skin-care and much more concerned with Deep lines, fine wrinkles, lacklusture skin, exfoliation etc... Then granactive retinoid 2% in emulsion will be you  go-to holy grail!

I am 30 y o guy myself but I'm into skin care primarily due to my obsession with perfecting the largest organ in human body and providing nourishment. üòä Also, ex sephora PR head, so I know the business of cosmetics and the mumbo-jumbo behind the scenes as well.

Let me know if you need any specific help / concerns for his skin that you would like help with. Happy to help.
 Thanks for the in depth review, I've been eyeing it for a little bit but I think you've sold me on it Hi there! 

You will need to provide short reviews(1-2 sentences) of every item in the picture or a longer review (1-2 short paragraphs) of your top 3 items. Let me know when you add that information! Thank you very much! He has clear post-accutane skin and uses argan oil every day and he‚Äôs GLOWING. I just wanted to build him a 3-4 step every day routine. The only thing I was unsure about is the serum, to target fine forehead lines. From what I heard buffet is a good ‚Äúall in one‚Äù serum so this was the one of choice. He has no other skin concerns, he honestly has perfect skin except for a few needle pick scars on his cheeks but they‚Äôre not very deep/noticeable, which he honestly doesn‚Äôt mind so it would be unnecessary to go for something as ‚Äústrong‚Äù as a retinoid at his age (20). 

I would just like a bit more information on the buffet+peptides please, I‚Äôve never tried or bought this serum so I don‚Äôt know what it is that I should add to it. Thanks again. Glad to be of help... Do try it in store, if you prefer to have a feel of the oils density / texture.  I think you will like it quite a lot.

Happy glowing skin to you ü§ó I just added robust info. Also a in-depth skin care routine. 
Please approve. From his skincare regime and history, Buffet+Copper Peptide would be much more viable for him. Copper Peptides are known to be very effective Anti-oxidants and Anti-aging. The natural role of these peptides as found in human plasma includes supporting a wide range of skin health functions like maintaining normal immune function, collagen synthesis, fibroblast production and anti-inflammatory responses. The inclusion of Copper Peptides offers a natural blue tint to the formula.

&#x200B;

If he has post-acne scars even though not too deep / shallow, then Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion will help address those as well. It is the most gentlest form of Retinoid and the emulsion makes it further moisturizing without any irritation. The mild though deep layer sustained exfoliation via Granactive Retinoid is answers to all of the minor concerns you mentioned. (Post acne scarring, Not deep, maintaining healthy skin post accurate use).

&#x200B;

Here is some additional info from their website which is why I would recommend this over buffet. So first Preference from my end, Buffet+Copper peptides (If you are looking to maintain healthy skin with minor anti-aging). or else, Granactive Retinoid in 2% emulsion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, if I may, you might want to switch to Marula or Chia Seed oil instead of Argan, now that we are on verge to enter spring break. Argan Oil is extremely lipid / oily and nourishing but might also clog pores to a great extend.

&#x200B;

Chia or Marula are lighter and both are very much recommended for post acne treatments such as Accutane / Prescription retinoids (Chia is hydrating, calming and is mildly oily but dissipates quickly, has amazing lipid profile which is ideal for Spring/Summers).

&#x200B;

Marula: Light weight/ almost Dry oil which dissipates quickly (Buy the Ordinary one if you are on a budget, it is as good if not better than Drunk Elephants - Marula oil which I call, surrender your life to demon in a bottle because of its price point!).

It is perfect for all seasons, very versatile usage (Hair+Skin), helps with hydration and ideal for PM use.

&#x200B;

Info on Granactive Retinoid as per TO website:

[https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-advanced-retinoid-2pct-30ml?redir=1](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-advanced-retinoid-2pct-30ml?redir=1)

&#x200B;

&#x200B; Thank you, post approved. Thank you so much for this useful information! The granactive retinoid sounds perfect but unfortunately it does not ship to Canada(?). So I will be purchasing the buffet, I think it is a better fit despite the minimal scarring. 

Super interesting about the oils. I use argan oil daily and to my greatest surprise I haven‚Äôt broken out at all. I know it‚Äôs heavy and I will consider switching it to a lighter one for summer, but I am pleased with what the argan has done for me and my boyfriend. My skin is extremely acne prone and it apparently loves argan, this is the longest I‚Äôve been without a blemish/breakout. Thanks again for all this info I will greatly consider a lighter oil for summer.  Thank you for guiding me ü§ó  Yes, I am a Canadian myself and miss it terribly. But ! [https://www.beautybay.com/p/the-ordinary/granactive-retinoid-2-emulsion/](https://www.beautybay.com/p/the-ordinary/granactive-retinoid-2-emulsion/) was a answer to my prayers. Although higher than the ordinary mark-up price, it was well worth it as a bottle lasts around 2-3 months of regular use and 4-5 months of once weekly use.

&#x200B;

If you however prefer Buffet for ease of availability, then please buy Buffet+Copper Peptide for almost same price but better added effect of mild anti-aging with copper peptide benefits, this is available across Canadian stores and Online as well.

&#x200B;

Yes, Argan Oil will suit acne prone skin post a drying / active use of accutane / Retinols (Perception strength) cause your skin will crave for moisture for building up the skin barrier. However, for Spring / Summer Argan can be a bit of pore clogging and too hydrating as it won't dissipate that quickly like a Marula or Chia seed oil. Argan oil is also known to be a excellent skin healing oil and so is Chia (Chia however is also a non-irritant and anti-inflammatory as a ++)

&#x200B;

:) I am glad I could be of help.

Happy glowing skin to you both. Not too much product and your race is irrelevant. :) Definitely not! Taking care of yourself transcends age, race, and gender. Keep doing you :) No! Perfect amount, nothing to be ashamed of just taking care of your skin.  So.. I‚Äôm concerned for you that you use that particular scrub. The St. Ives apricot scrub has walnut shell in it which is too sharp for the skin on the face. 


It may not look like it's doing damage but it causes microscopic tears on your skin, because of the size and irregular shape. Physical exfoliants in general are often rough on the skin, which is why most people here tend to use chemical exfoliants. 


If you find your skin does okay with physical exfoliants, I hope you‚Äôll consider switching to something with a gentler ingredient like oatmeal or sugar.  People le love SK-II. How are you liking it? Not at all! You are taking care of your skin well :) i like SkII products too! I could probably use it everyday if it weren‚Äôt pricey üò≠ I‚Äôll scope them both out! What‚Äôs a good chemical exfoliant? So nice to see a man using SK-|| though  ‚ù§Ô∏è [deleted] I just thought some skin care stuff would be different depending on your race. Ie Asian/Black/Caucasian ect Thank ya ‚ò∫Ô∏è The hardest thing is perfecting the regimen. Buying is the easy part :'D I see! Thanks for the info. Would you recommend any one in particular? I think it's working well. My 3rd week on it and about to run out of cleanser because I got the travel pack duty free.

I'm assessing whether clinique might be the same bang for lower buck I need to renew for the first time since getting the skII intro pack duty free. I was hoping I‚Äôd be able to find a comparable skin care regimen for cheaper but alas I think I‚Äôll just need to shell out money for SKII > ash, I use the Aesop scrub, have also liked the bamb

I think my skin is looking better. At least this is what I'm told by the Asian women around me. That's pretty much the benchmark right :,D It is not proven to be bad. People are far too dramatic about it. If it works for your skin that‚Äôs fine.  > SKA

No I actually haven't. I'm a bit of a noob I'm afraid but thank you for the advice. I'm always looking to up my skincare game. Haha just cuz there are memes about something doesn't mean it's true

The dramas around St. Ives are mostly based on, well, nothing really. I haven't seen any studies showing that rougher scrubs or that St. Ives in particular causes a different type of physical exfoliation than other physical exfoliants, or that a different type of physical exfoliation would inherently be bad. You might be interested in [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/6hm9r4/miscellaneous_when_you_get_downvoted_on_another/dizjeg9/) that goes into the microtear idea and where it came from.

While many people prefer gentler scrubs, and many people may overuse St. Ives and not know their skin well enough to be able to judge potential harm, it certainly works well and is beneficial for others. As always, ymmv! There's not solid evidence of the microtears claim. If it works for you, keep using it.  Well.. I swear by chemical exfoliants. But people who like physical exfoliants have often sworn by [Burt's Bees Cranberry & Pomegranate Sugar Scrub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VUMMLQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_jIKMAbM5KWRJ9) Sorry but sk-ii and Clinique are not even close to the same.  If you don‚Äôt use it multiple times a day, every day, then I think it‚Äôs fine! Physical exfoliation gets a bad rep here because it can be irritating and drying if it‚Äôs overdone. But if your skin seems to do fine with it and you use it reasonably, I think it‚Äôs fine to have. Since it is really rough (rather than fine particles) it‚Äôs a pretty abrasive exfoliant which is why people here don‚Äôt like it. That being said YMMV, and I also like physical exfoliation about 3 times a week.  So stick with SKII? I see. It makes sense. It‚Äôs just a matter of finding a good exfoliator so I don‚Äôt end up with exposed muscle tissue üòÇ It honestly depends on your skin‚Äôs needs. The SK-ii cleanser is hydrating while purifying. I feel the biggest downside is the amount you get for the price, it‚Äôs one of the smallest cleansers I‚Äôve used though admittedly a little goes a long way. Clinique has multiple types of cleansers but it‚Äôs hard to give recommendations from any brands without knowing your skin type and concerns.  I know what you mean when it comes to price vs volume but and it does the job pretty well despite sparing use. 

I think I have combination dry/oily skin and would like to avoid wrinkles and generally do the best I can for it (doesn‚Äôt everyone). There‚Äôs no doubt that SK-ii makes beautiful products and I say if you can afford it, go for it. I saw from another post that you‚Äôre in Australia so unfortunately I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs available there as far as other brands go (I‚Äôm in the US.) 
Their RNA line is going to be the anti-aging line and Genoptics is brightening. What you have is the RNA moisturizer. The RNA essence and Genoptics essence are NOT the same as the treatment essence, they‚Äôre serums and just in case you were wondering, the clear treatment lotion is their toner. 
No clue if you even wanted or needed that information but I hope it helps! > NA line is going to be the anti-aging line and Genoptics is brightening. What you have is the RNA moistu

Thank you. Basically I'm looking to fill in any skincare regimen gaps and upgrade the ones I already have. So I should stick with the SKII RNA stuff I have plus get the rna essence? Would I need to use the treatment essence as well? 

I didn't think there was much difference between Toners that's why I'm using Avene, but do you think even that is worth an upgrade?

 1. Skin type: normal, skin concern: acne scars, goals: get rid or fade acne scars
2. AM:
   1. Innisfree blueberry balancing cleanser
   2. Neutrogena Ultra Sheer face & body stick sunscreen SPF 50+

PM:

1. Innisfree olive cleansing oil
2. Innisfree blueberry balancing cleanser
3. Retin-A Micro
4. Innisfree cica balm
5. CeraVe PM

3. Mini reviews:

* Innisfree Moist UV Protection Stick Winter Barrier SPF 50+ PA++++: Got this as a gift from my aunt. I originally requested the lotion form but my aunt thought sticks were more convenient. The stick is actually a totally different, this is totally physical while the lotion form is totally chemical. Very obvious white cast, and pills up as well. Would not recommend. Considering giving this to my younger sister who has whiter skin.
* Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Face & Body Stick Sunscreen SPF 50+: Got this at a local grocery store when I found out my aunt is sending me a sunscreen stick. This is actually nicer than the Ultra Sheer in sunscreen lotion. No white cast, goes on totally transparent, the scent is a nice touch as well.
* Neutrogena Hydro Boost SPF 50+ Water Gel Sunscreen: Bought this in the summer when I got tired of paying extra for Asian sunscreens. The scent is a bit yucky, but this goes on without white cast as well. I've had troubles with white cast with Neutrogena's other chemical sunscreen lotions such as Ultra Sheer or Clear Face. This is basically an American version of Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence, I would say.
* Biore UV Mild Care Milk: This used to be my GOAT HG sunscreen until they reformulated it to include titanium dioxide. This sunscreen is so nice, it goes on like lotion, not sunscreen. So clean.
* Innisfree Cica Balm: Not sure what this does but my aunt said it helps with acne.
* CeraVe PM: The niacinamide is a bit irritating to my skin for now, trying this again for about a week now. It is very moisturizing because of the ceramides and hyaulronic acid.
* Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion: I bought this because it is travel size. I found the lotion pills when used after applying Retin-A Micro. So I'm not going to use this anymore.
* Innisfree Blueberry Balancing Cleansing Foam: Got this as a present from my aunt. Foams up really well and the glycerin is really moisturizing. Might be my HG cleanser.
* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser: Bought this because my local grocery store did not have CeraVe foaming facial cleanser, only the hydrating facial cleanser. Does not foam up as well but it is still a nice cleanser. Ooh, CeraVe I have combo/dry skin prone to clogged pores with PIH mostly on my cheeks. Most of these work for me, some of them I am still testing.

It like dries out my pimples I really like their AHA body cleanser for back/shoulder acne! I used Mario Badescu for YEARS.  It‚Äôs pretty good and helped calm my skin. I switched to another brand (Misumi) for cleanser/toner and it helped my skin, I think it‚Äôs slightly more effective.

Were they helpful with the whiteheads/clogged pores/deep pimples? My skin Type: Oily/combination 

AM Routine: MB acne facial cleanser, MB cucumber aloe spray and Origins matte moisturiser with willowherb

PM routine: same as AM but if I have pimples/acne I skip the moisturiser and use MB drying lotion on the pimples/acne

Top 3 Products: 

1. MB Drying Lotion: Honestly works wonders! Even after a day my acne has noticeably calmed down and by day 3 it almost disappeared
2. Origins Matte Moisturiser with Willowherb, price-wise wasn't too bad but the thing I like about it is that it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without it being too dry. Scent is also pretty calming.
3. MB Acne Facial Cleanser: Doesn't have much of a smell which can be a good thing! Doesn't dry out my skin and leaves a fresh feeling after use Products shown: 

Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser

Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber and Green Tea

Origins Original Skin Matte Moisturiser with Willowherb

Mario Badescu Drying Lotion I mainly used them on surface pimples and red spots.

However, I'm afraid I've had to remove your post for now because it doesn't abide by our [post requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/postrequirements).

The users of this sub would like to know more about the products in your image and how you're using them. That's why we ask everyone who posts a Shelfie to include the following information in the comments:

- Your skin type & skin concerns

- Full list of products pictured and your AM & PM routine

- Reviews! Either:

   - Short mini reviews for each of your products (e.g. "Smells like pepperoni pizza and feels like jello but man it really helped with my burgeoning devil horns!")

   - or longer in-depth reviews for your top 3, which should at least cover: the packaging, product feel & smell, what are the positive & negative effects, does it do what it should/what you bought it for, and overall opinion

Let me know when you‚Äôve added that info so I can approve your post :) Skin Type & Concerns: Fair skin. Looking for ways to reduce dark spots, fine lines and wrinkles

AM Routine:
1) Sunday Riley Blue Moon - decent balm, great smell. Works as a mask too. Looking to switch off to Farmacy Green clean. 
2) Sunday Riley Ceramic Slip - good cleanser. Will be Trying Tarte Knockout for something with a bit more exfoliation. 
3) Fresh Rose Deep Hydrating Facial Toner - works great, smells good. Only gripe is the rose petals get caught in spout. Either use cotton pad or splash a bit on face. 
3) Sunday Riley CEO Glow - amazing serum, gives a nice glow. Works great. 
4) Sunday Riley Juno - great serum with a peppery smell. Staple of my routine. 
5) TO Hyaluronic Acid - solid product, makes my skin feel plump. 
6) Youth To The People Glow - live this serum, need to restock it. Amazing scent. 
7) Clinique Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector & Optimizer - long time staple of my routine. Takes a while to show results. But you will eventually see the results - it works. 
8) Clinique For Men Super Energizer - solid moisturizer with spf. Works great for my skin. I mix it with a few pumps of the Clinique fresh pressed squeeze vitamin c. Combo is amazing. Will be trying Murad City Skin Age Defense to see how it works against this. 
9) For my eyes, switch off between Clinique for Men Anti-Fatigue Depuffing eye gel (solid, quick product I‚Äôve been using for years), Clinique For Men Anti-Age Eye Cream, and Kiehls Eye Fuel. 
10) Tatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Mist - great stuff, makes your skin look good and lasts a long time. 

PM Routine: 

1) Sunday Riley Blue Moon
2) Sunday Riley Ceramic Slip
3) PTR Peptide 21 Pads - great products, work amazing. Skin will zing a bit. Every couple of days I swap this for PTR Exfoliating Super Peel. Super strong. Rinse off well with water after both. 
4) MASK TIME - Love masks so much I do one every night. Switch between PTR Irish Moor Mud ( fav PTR mask), PTR Cucumber Gel (smells great, works best cold), PTR Rose Stem Cell (nice smell, good results), Tatcha Violet C Radiance Mask (fav mask, amazing results). Not shown is my sheet mask collection (use those after all my serums if I have time). Afterwards I‚Äôll use PTR Water Drench Eye Patches which work great. 
5) Fresh Rose Deep Hydrating Facial Toner
6) Murad Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum - works great but has a wacky smell. Oh well. 
7) Sunday Riley Luna - love it, great smell.  Soaks up in my skin quickly. 
8) Sunday Riley Juno
9) Sunday Riley Good Genes - best lactic product Ive tried. Haven‚Äôt had the new formula yet but cant wait. 
10) TO TIME: Hyaluronic Acid, Ascorbyl,  Marula Oil, Alpha Lipoic (1x a week), Salicylic Acid as needed (or use Clinqiue Clinical Salicylic if needed). 
11)  Clinique Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector & Optimizer
12) Youth To The People Superberry Hydrate + Glow Dream Mask & Clinique Fresh Pressed Overnight Booster - amazing combo, good smell and great results the next morning. Using the mask in place of Clinique turnaround overnight which is also great. 
13) For eyes, ill use anything from my am routine + TO caffeine for a nice boost.  Has helped to really clear my fine lines and crows feet up. 

Open to any suggestions or thoughts. Thinking of reducing down my routine a bit. Takes too long and is likely overkill. Post updates made! Wow that‚Äôs.... extensive! 
Just to make sure I get it right: do you really do all of the above mentioned steps each AM/PM? Excellent, thank you so much! Approved :D

I'd like to make a joke about your username and cookin up a good comment, but I'm tired so let's just pretend I'm really good at making dad jokes :) Yup. Everyday. It‚Äôs too long though, and I am looking to reduce down the steps or consolidate at least. Well, where do we start here....

First of all, I‚Äòd eliminate duplicates. Identify products which serve the same purpose/feature the same active ingredients and stick to only one of them.

Generally look at the actives you use. It might be better for your skin to not mix them too much. Certain combinations make sense, others don‚Äôt or can even be harmful for your skin. I‚Äòd limit the actives to one at a time, like not use all of them every times but rather alternate them. 

Some products are better used in the AM, e.g. retinoids. 

Additionally, check the order in which your using the products. For example, applying acids for chemical exfoliation **after** a mask doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me. 

Hope this helps a bit... Ah, so I've had a message I need to include quite a lot of info if I want to post a shelfie... 

So my corner which I know more of (top left) . My skin is Indian but I live in England, so has to withstand all seasons over the course of a day sometimes. My moisture L'Or√©al because it was on offer in Tesco, tend to alternate between this and Nivea (again based on offer) . Hair product is layrite pomade, i didn't know about Pomade until I played red dead redemption 2, googled it, brought it and it's wonderful, nice holds and rinses out beautifully but that's a hair product so has no place on this thread so don't know why I'm talking about it.

My SO's stuff....jeez! She's also Indian and British, is 32 but regularly gets id'd and considering we have two young kids should say how wonderful her skin is. It's proper clean! And the products.. Recently she's massively got into beauty pie and is a huge fan, so much so she appears to have brought all their stock. Before that and concurrently it was the ordinary products. Clarins is when she does her at home treat yo' self face session. I use the top right under eye and spot sorter outer (niaciminide??). Hope that's enough info, imagine it isn't but i tried! Hi! You've added some great info, but we will need a bit more :)

- A full list of the products pictured

- Your routine

- Reviews! For your products, please add either:

   - Short mini reviews for each of your products (e.g. "Smells like pepperoni pizza and feels like jello but man it really helped with my burgeoning devil horns!")

   - or longer in-depth reviews for your top 3, which should at least cover: the packaging, product feel & smell, what are the positive & negative effects, does it do what it should/what you bought it for, and overall opinion

You don't have to worry about your SO's products or routine, although if you know her thoughts on any of them, we'd definitely be interested in hearing that! Japanfusion cleanser from beauty pie. Gentle but thorough leaves skin feeling very fresh. Use in the evening in winter and day and night during summer. Then use the ordinary under eye drops and ordinary Niaciminide on any blemish area. Finally moisturises using the L'Or√©al antiwrinkle moisturiser. The under eye treatments are keeping my heavy bags in check from the broken sleep due to the aforementioned kids. I like the moisturiser as doesn't leave my face feeling greasy like some I've used in the past. My top 3 products is the cleanser, under eye ordinary drops and the moisturiser. None of them smell like pepperoni :-). She‚Äôs wearing makeup though is this the circle jerk sub lmao Is this a joke..  No, I don‚Äôt think so. Completely unrealistic IMO.  No. I used to worry that I was the only person with pores all over my face. Then I started noticing people's skin that I talk to and realized everybody has normal looking skin. Nobody looks like this photo above.  That skin isn't "perfect"... she doesn't have any pores, so would be in the hospital with cracked and broken skin like the Singing Detective in a few weeks.

Also apparently no sweat glands, so she'd be unconscious if the temperature ever topped 30C... No. Think about this for a second. Have you ever in your life seen an actual human being in person who looks like this? No. And how many humans have you seen in person, in your lifetime? Thousands, easily. If this were possible in reality, don't you think you'd have met at least one person who looked like that by now?

Humans have pores. We require them to regulate temperature and maintain skin resiliency. Humans have variable skin tone. It's part and parcel of having red blood. You would literally be dead if you had skin like this, because the only way to achieve this in real life is to have severely defective skin and no circulatory system.

Also, humans have imperfections. Because nothing is perfect. And how boring the world would be if it were, really.

This has been so extremely photoshopped that she looks like a Barbie doll, and it should immediately stand out as fake to anyone with a realistic grip on what real people look like. Come back to reality. Go outside and look at real people. Lmao she used makeup + airbrushed.  The pic is not even in a good quality either .  I know photoshop when I see it.  Not trying to take away from her beauty but the picture quality is not that great to begin with.  I mean even her hair is somewhat blurred. No photo goes unedited, but I am sure she has a great skin to begin with Why don't you look at people in real life and tell me if anyone looks like that? Spoiler: no. Maybe this will help give you some perspective: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/06/patients-are-desperate-to-resemble-their-doctored-selfies-plastic-surgeons-alarmed-by-snapchat-dysmorphia/ Waiter, where's my sauce?  
  
Srs, feels like /r/SkincareAddiction and /r/SCAcirclejerk are slowly meshing together This. When did "photoshopped to look like an alien" become our standard of human perfection? It's so weird to me how we now see normal healthy skin as ugly. **Direct link**: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/06/patients-are-desperate-to-resemble-their-doctored-selfies-plastic-surgeons-alarmed-by-snapchat-dysmorphia/

 do you eat your EPO caps or rub on your face? I am also sensitive to rosehip oil :'( tried it recently and it burned my face. My skintype: dry, dehydrated and sensitive skin. Diagnosed with rosacea and received Metrodinazol cream a couple months ago. Lately I have removed this prescribed cream from my routine, and so far so good :):)

Product + recipe list (from left to right)
-Homemade Vit C serum (natural real food vitamin C power, distilled water and vegetable glycerine in a dark colored container to store): I introduced it a couple days ago, and it's quite thick because of the glycerine. I only use one drop of this serum and pat it gently all over my face. I will let you know how it works in a couple of weeks so stay tuned!

-The Original Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion: it is so smooth to rub it on my face but after one application I felt like it dried my skin a bit. I would re-introduce again in a few months, and see how it feels!
-The Original Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5: I started using this in my PM routine and oh my god my face feels so plump in the morning!!! 

-Fairtrade green tea: I drink a cup of tea in the morning, and squeeze the wet teabag on a cotton pad to apply it on my face.

-Royal green (extra virgin) coconut oil: the oil cleansing method has been the best thing ever to my face! I use a microfiber cloth to remove the oil with water. I noticed that I need a few extra rubs around my eyes to remove make-up, and my eyes get a bit red... so I decided to avoid eye makeup until I figured out a better cleansing method. Any tips? :)

-Farfalla argan oil: lifelong savior for my skin

-Farfalla jojoba oil: couldn't have been happier to discover this product, my face stops overproducing oil!

- (top) Alqvimia rosehip oil: I'm a bit sensitive to rosehip oil, it dried my skin a bit, I stopped using it at the moment.

- (bottom) Lamberts evening primrose oil 500mg with added Vitamin E): this is probably the best discovery I have ever made for my skin. All my blemishes are gone and my face feels plump!

-Eucerin ultrasensitive calming cream: I wish I could make my own moisturizer instead of buying Eucerin products. Do you have any recipes I could use?

-Eucerin oil control sun screen SPF 50: this product makes my face a bit too oily, I need to find a matter SPF cream.. do you have any suggestions? Thank you so much!

My current routine:
AM
1) Cleanse with coconut oil
2) Homemade green tea toner
3) Homemade Vitamin C serum
4) Eucerin creams (SPF 50) mixed with a drop of each oils: argan, jojoba and evening primrose (+ vitamin E)
5) Make-up

PM
1) Cleanse twice with coconut oil
2) optional: apply homemade green team honey face mask then exfoliate
3) Green tea toner
4) HA 2% +B5, OR, Vitamin C serum
5) A few drops of argan oil, jojoba oil and evening primrose oil (+ vitamin E)
 Thanks so much for your answer!! I often mix my oils in my moisturizers, which includes the SPF. The only reason why I mix is because I am a bit lazy üòú Would you advise me to not mix them? 

I'm not sure where to put the granactive retinoid emulsion and rosehip oil in my routine. I noticed that both products dried my skin a very little bit, maybe I am applying it wrong. I only used each once... 

My skin is dry and sensitive, and I was prescribed Metrodinazol 5 months ago to treat rosacea. 
So my current routine is:

AM
1) Cleanse with coconut oil
2) Homemade green tea toner
3) Homemade Vitamin C serum
4) Eucerin creams (SPF 50) mixed with a drop of each oils: argan, jojoba and evening primrose (+ vitamin E)
5) Make-up

PM
1) Cleanse twice with coconut oil
2) Optional: apply homemade green team honey face mask then exfoliate
3) Homemade green tea toner
4) HA 2% +B5, OR, Vitamin C serum
5) A few drops of argan oil, jojoba oil and evening primrose oil (+ vitamin E) Yeah I've heard such great benefits from rosehip oil. Too bad it irritates our skin! Luckily there are other oils we can use! Do you also have sensitive/rosacea skin? May I ask what products you use? And your am pm routine?

For EPO: I create a small opening op a cap with my teeth, then gently squeeze out 3-4 drops directly onto my forehead, my cheeks and chin. I then swallow the rest of the cap (sometime I just squeeze the rest of the oil into my mouth and throw away the 'shell'). My EPO caps also include vitamin E and I think that has seriously helped my skin to rehydrate! Would you mind formatting your comment a bit? It's really hard to read your products without that. I don't have rosacea but I think Im coming to learn my skin responds OK to more sensitive treatments. Just posted a [routine help thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7zj0xf/routine_help_starting_to_feel_discouraged/) that details at where I am right now with my routine. Kind of a WIP. I will have to try the EPO soon :) I was scared after the rosehip but maybe it's time lol Hey! Thanks for your reply! I used spaces between my products. Does it help? Let me know! Maybe I need to add more spaces... How quickly did you purchase and add these products to your routine? Only asking because when I started I added too much to my routine at once and it took ages to figure out what worked and didn‚Äôt, plus I bought stuff I never ended up needing. If you‚Äôve been at this a bit though and know, ignore my comment haha  Hi there,

I'm afraid I've had to remove your post because it doesn't abide by our [post requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/rulesandpolicy#wiki_7._follow_our_post_requirements). But you're really close to having everything we require.

The users of this sub would like to know more about the products in your image and how you're using them. That's why we ask everyone who posts a Shelfie to include the following information in the comments:

 

1. **Your skin type, skin concerns, and skin goals**
2. **Full skincare routine (AM and PM) which includes all products pictured and your reason for using them**  
  If you're not currently using some of the products, tell us where in your routine they usually go, or where you're planning to put them! 
  Your routine / product list must include:
  * Full names of each product
  * Why do you have this product (e.g. 'hyperpigmentation', 'hydration')
3. **ONE of the following:**  
    a) A really **short mini-review for each product**, e.g. "Smells like pepperoni pizza and feels like jello but man it really helped with my burgeoning devil horns!"
 
    b) **Longer reviews for the top 3 products** in your shelfie, which should at least cover:  
      * what's the packaging like; 
      * product feel and smell; 
      * what are the positive and negative effects; 
      * does it do what it should / what you bought it for;
      * why is this product in your top 3;
      * overall opinion.
 
    c) In case of shelfies that focus on showing **innovative storage solutions**: a description of the previous problem and an explanation of the storage solution that solved it.
 
 
 
After you've done that, please reply to this comment so I can approve your post. 
 
Thank you! I think I have combination skin, but will be confirming that when I get a facial in a couple weeks. I have problems with hormonal acne but it‚Äôs been getting better! My goal is to reduce / eliminate the painful pimples I get around my period.

Products from top row left to right:

* The Ordinary: niacinamide 10% + zinc 1%
* The Ordinary: Salicylic Acid 2% solution
* The Ordinary: 100% Plant-derived squalane
* Farsali rose gold elixir
* Drunk elephant: Beste No. 9 jelly cleanser
* Drunk Elephant: Protini polypeptide cream
* La Roche-Posay effaclar duo+
* Caudalie polyphenol anti wrinkle eye and lip cream
* Cerave PM moisturizer
* Cerave eye repair cream
* Cerave AM moisturizer
* Ahava hydration cream mask (leave-in overnight)
* Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser
* neutragena deep clean cleanser

Not picture is Jojoba oil and Marcelle micellar water to remove makeup, and I‚Äôm also thinking about purchasing La Roche-Posay sunscreen.

I‚Äôm just getting started on a routine, any advice welcome!

Currently I have defined my routine as follows:

&#x200B;

**AM:**

1. Wash with cetaphil every day, except for 2x a week where I was with the Neutragena.
2. Niacinamide
3. Farsali Oil
4. Cerave eye repair cream
5. Cerave AM moisturizer
6. I need the sunscreen

**PM:**

1. Use jojoba oil to loosen up my eye makeup and remove all makeup with marcelle micellar water
2. Wash with Cetaphil (2x a week I will do the Drunk Elephant jelly cleanser, not on the same day as Neutrogena)
3. Salicylic acid 1x per week not when I do neutragena or drunk elephant
4. Farsali oil
5. Cerave eye repair cream
6. La Roche-Posay duo 3x per week
7. Cerave PM moisturizer

I cycle the Caudalie and Cerave eye repair cream (until I run out of Caudalie), as well as the Plant-based squalane with the Farsali oil (almost out of the squalane). I also do the Hydrating mask 1-2x / week, and try to do a treatment ask (I have a few PTR masks I'm using). 

&#x200B;

I absolutely love the niacinamide, I'm not really sure what it does but I feel like it has really cleared up some of the smaller skin issues I was having (like black heads and small pimples). It also feels really nice on the skin and I feel fresh after I use it. 

&#x200B;

The Farsali oil makes my skin feel amazing but I think it smells really gross - kind of fishy. It also doesn't absorb as well as I would like so I'm going to be looking for somethign different once I run out.

&#x200B;

The Cetaphil cleanser is my holy grail. I probably use it too much both in AM and PM but I just really really clean when I use it.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I don't really know what I'm doing! Fake it til you make it :)

&#x200B; Hello! I've added all of the information (I think!) in a comment. Thank you! Looks great! Re-approved, thank you so much. :) **Hi everyone! SkincareAddiction is a friendly community of skincare enthusiasts.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.* Your skincare routine is great. It's probably just not enough at the moment. Aside from niacinamide (which imo doesn't measure up as an acne treatment), you don't have any actives in your routine.

The bumps are probably just open comedones (i.e. blackheads) but the skin around them is a little more raised than a typical blackhead. They'll probably improve with a few months of exfoliation with BHA (Paula's Choice, Stridex) or even a retinoid like Adapalene. Just don't overdo it this time around. 

I also think they might respond well to professional extractions by a medical aesthetician if that's something you might have access to (please don't try to extract by yourself!), but you'd still want an exfoliant to keep them from coming back.

I'm not seeing a sunscreen in your routine. I bet a soothing sunscreen like Purito Unscented could also help with the redness while protecting your skin, but any sunscreen is important. I've been using this for years and I love it so much! Did you have hyperpigmentation on your body? Or did you mean face? How long until you noticed a difference? Glad a friend recommended this to me and have definitely found a new staple into my nighttime routine. I personally shower at night, but I assume you would also be able to use this product in any part of your morning routine. I don‚Äôt use it to target anything else other than my hyperpigmentation, but know that my friend has body acne and says that it helps with the scarring. I know Amlactin makes different body lotions that target other problem areas, but this one was recommended because it is gentle enough for someone with sensitive skin (me) to use everyday. I don‚Äôt know how I lived without it!! Body. I noticed after about a week of using this every day. I also mix it in with my favorite body lotion (Aveeno Daily) to prolong the usage. Are you being facetious or serious?  Newbie here and I thought that physical scrubs like that were overly harsh?  This ruined my face 3 years ago ouch. I was young and foolish. Be careful with it, or maybe just spare your face and use for the body. I also love this for my face, I‚Äôm surprised to see so many people disapprove. I agree it‚Äôs a very harsh scrub I only use it once every other week at most but it leaves my skin so soft and noticeably nice looking for several days after using it.  I am cringing, this stuff is very harsh! Ouch. Kudos if it works for you, though.  They can be harsh if you over use them but I have been using it in a limited, treat yourself way. It has worked for me but obviously everybody's skin/face is different. I, personally, wouldn't recommend using something like that on your face...  Ruined your face? How often were you using it? Thank you for this response! I was beginning to feel a bit unwelcome in this subreddit. 

Like I said in a previous response, I don't use this daily so my skin has no problem with it. My face is always left feeling extra soft and glowing!  It has worked wonders for me so far! My skin has been more radiant since using it and I have yet to have any issues. Thanks! :)  Every other day. I basically rawed my skin transparent.  This type of post would be more helpful with a mini review or at least a product list in the comments. Sorry for the lack of details.  

AM: 
-Cetaphil cleanser
-Sodium Sulfacetamide (9.8% - Sulfur (4.8%) 2-3x per week.
-Neutrogena Clear Face 30 SPF liquid lotion sunscreen. 
-Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel cream for extra dry skin.
Doxycycline 100 mg  

PM:
-Cetaphil cleanser
-Adapalene 0.1% (3x per week)
-Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel cream for extra dry skin.
-Vanicream
-Doxycycline 100mg

I‚Äôm 41 and trying to get out of puberty before menopause. I‚Äôve always had oily skin, period breakouts and it‚Äôs no help that I picked my skin.  I went to derm occasionally during my 20‚Äôs but ended up feeling frustrated. 

Originally I was using the sulfur cleanser and the Adapalene daily. I followed my regimen but didn‚Äôt do enough homework about Differin and combinations. I should not have been surprised about my face itching and burning. After week 2 my derm took down the Adapalene to 3 times a week. She said the sulfur wash should not be causing any discomfort but yesterday after washing my face I put a hold on the sulfur wash.  My lips were blistering. 

The Hydro Boost and Clear Face SPF 30 are non-greasy.

Fingers crossed, I found a combo that works for me. People still do this, huh?
